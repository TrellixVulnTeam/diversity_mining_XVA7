“ At Allstate, we believe 
sustainable businesses 
create profits, provide  
meaningful work for  
employees and are a  
force for good in their  
local communities. 
These responsibilities, 
embedded in Our Shared  
Purpose, serve as 
guideposts throughout 
the organization.”

—  Tom Wilson  
Board Chair,  
President and Chief  
Executive Officer

Allstate’s story is about today, 
tomorrow and long into the future. 
We are a purpose-driven company, 
powered by purpose-driven people. 
Allstate’s purpose is to protect 
people from life’s uncertainties and 
prepare them for the future.

Profits are one measure of how 
effectively we harness the resources 
we borrow from society. Businesses 
also create dignity through 
meaningful work where people can 
realize their full potential and purpose 
in life. Business must also be a force 
for good, using our capabilities and 
resources to improve communities.

Allstate delivers on all of these 
components of sustainability. Our 
operating performance is strong, 
as you can see from our financial 
reports. We help employees pursue 
their purpose in life through fair 
compensation, inclusive diversity  
and personal growth. 

Allstate empowers youth and 
victims of domestic violence. We 
support thousands of nonprofits in 
conjunction with Allstate agencies 
in local communities throughout 
America. We are a force for good.

Why a Prosperity Report?
Allstate is about creating the future 

Annual reports were created before ubiquitous and continuous information flows. Today, a company’s 
successes and disappointments are tweeted while blogs and social media sites shape reputation one word 
at a time. As a result, we want to share the broader story of Allstate’s successes and challenges in the first 
of many Prosperity Reports.

Businesses create prosperity. Iron rocks are molded into steel skyscrapers and molecules are combined 
to create lifesaving drugs. Allstate protects tens of millions of people from life’s uncertainties and helps 
them rebuild their lives after disaster strikes. Private enterprises employ 85% of the U.S. workforce. Capital, 
people, intelligence and processes are combined to make the world a better place. Quite simply, the world 
is a better place because of one of society’s greatest organizational creations: business.

To continue creating prosperity businesses must take on a bigger role in society. Let’s be clear, a business 
needs to make an acceptable profit since this is a measure of how effectively it uses society’s resources. 
Yet more is expected and needed from business. Eighty-seven percent of young Americans believe that 
businesses need to do more than make a profit. Companies also need to be held accountable for creating 
jobs, making sure free markets work and improving our communities. 

At Allstate we pursue these four goals by following Our Shared Purpose, which is shown on the opposite 
page. In business, it is often said what gets measured gets done. We created this Prosperity Report to show 
how we measure up to our aspirations.

We create attractive risk-adjusted returns

We focus relentlessly on our priorities

Our Corporate Goal: Create long-term 
value by serving our stakeholders, taking 
appropriate risks, and leveraging our 
capabilities and strategic assets.

“ We measure financial returns by annual profit, 
return on capital and total return to shareholders. 
In 2017 we had very strong profitability as a 
multiyear auto insurance profit improvement plan 
paid off. Investment return was a strong 5.9% on 

our $83 billion diversified portfolio. We proactively 
manage capital for the total enterprise, each market-
facing business and by risk type. As a result, we 
generated a 13.4% adjusted net income return on 
equity†. Shareholder returns should be measured 
across a range of time periods, and Allstate exceeded 
its peers over one-, three- and five-year periods.”

•  Property-liability combined ratio 

of 93.6 in 2017 improved 2.4 points 
from the prior year.

•  Auto insurance underwriting profit 

increased by $1.14 billion in 2017 
from 2016. Homeowners insurance 
generated an underwriting profit 
of $658 million despite elevated 
catastrophe losses.

•  Our capital structure includes  
a mix of debt, preferred stock  
and common shares, resulting  
in substantial financial strength  
and an attractive cost of capital.

•  We protect over 6 million homes 

from catastrophe losses after 
natural disasters. Allstate is a  
leader in using reinsurance and 
capital markets to mitigate this  
risk for shareholders.

•  The $83 billion investment portfolio  

is 62% investment-grade fixed 
income securities but also includes  
$13.4 billion of equity and 
performance-based investments, 
which provides balanced  
risk-adjusted returns.

“ Superior investment returns require a disciplined process, 
rigorous risk management and intellectual curiosity to 
actively examine opportunities overlooked by others.”

•  More than 70% of drivable cars are 
now inspected through QuickFoto 
Claim®, our smartphone app that 
enables customers to start a claim 
by sending us photos of damage 
to their vehicles. Claims are now 
settled in hours instead of days.

We live our values every day

Our Values: 
• Honesty, caring and integrity
• Inclusive diversity
• Engagement
• Accountability
• Superior performance

“ Our values represent who we are and how we conduct 
ourselves – not just as employees, but as people, 
leaders, decision makers and members of society. 
They define our culture and what it means to be an 
Allstater. They are non-negotiable. It’s about doing 
the right thing in the right way at the right time.”

  — Tom Wilson

ETHICS

•  The 2017 Integrity Index, which 
measures the ethical health of 
our corporate culture across the 
Allstate family of companies on a 
7-point scale, reported:

  –  For “Comfort Speaking Up,” 

employees scored their 
environment a 6.12.

  –  For “Direct Manager Leadership,” 

employees scored their 
management a 6.19.

•  Our survey results consistently 

score above the external 
benchmark, reflecting the 
effectiveness of our ethics and 
compliance culture. 

•  As we expand our businesses and 

brands, we work hard to instill a 
culture where everyone has an 
obligation to ask questions, raise 
concerns and report violations 
of our Global Code of Business 
Conduct.

“ Global corporations 
operating with a common 
rule of law are now 
society’s strongest force 
to improve the human 
condition. … The World’s 
Most Ethical Companies 
in particular continued 
to show exemplary 
leadership. I congratulate 
everyone at Allstate for 
being recognized as 
one of the World’s Most 
Ethical Companies.”

—  Timothy Erblich, CEO, Ethisphere

INCLUSIVE DIVERSITY

•  We strive for a workforce that 

mirrors the diversity of the 
customers and communities 
we serve.

  –  We have 11 diverse Employee 

Resource Groups with over 
10,000 members. These groups 
bring employees together to 
develop professionally around 
shared communities.

  –  We have Inclusive Diversity 

commitments (hiring, 
development and advancement) 
in all areas of the business.

  –  We continuously work to ensure 

we have a diverse pipeline of

Allstate shared a portion of recently reduced federal 
taxes, providing $1,000 to $2,000 of employee Choice

satisfaction on benefits has declined as efforts to 
equalize medical benefits have led to higher cost 
increases for employees with families.

•  The Allstate system harnesses the talent of 82,900

PERSONAL PURPOSE

EMPLOYABILITY

•  Allstate is striving to be a purpose-

driven company powered by 
purpose-driven people.

•  Energy for Life (EFL) is a program 
that enables employees to clarify 
their personal purpose and build 
a plan to achieve more meaning in 
their lives. Over 27,000 Allstaters 
have completed EFL since it was 
launched for employees in 2010  
and agency owners in 2012. 

•  The Allstate Ambassador network 

is a movement of more than 
7,800 Allstaters who are engaging 
beyond their day-to-day roles. From 
on-the-job innovation to giving 
back, Ambassadors offer unique 
ways for every Allstater to bring 
the promise of our Employee Value 
Proposition to life.

•  We empower our employees to 
continue to learn, develop and 
take ownership of their careers. 
Our enterprise learning strategy is 
grounded in foundational pillars: 

  –  Building the technical 

skills needed in the future, 
enabling sustainable long-
term employability

  –  Creating lifelong learning 

opportunities through education, 
job assignments and our Tuition 
Assistance Program

•  Allstate provides employees with 
abundant training opportunities, 
such as webinars, seminars 
and classroom learning. In 2017, 
employees completed more than 
300,000 courses, accounting for 
nearly 360,000 hours of learning.

PERFORMANCE REWARDS

•  Pay for performance and 

competitive pay are critical 
elements of Allstate’s 
compensation philosophy and 
attract, retain and engage talent.

•  Allstate performs pay fairness 

analyses on employees’ salaries 
annually as well as analyzes 
discretionary pay decisions for its 
bonus-eligible leaders, looking for 
unintentional consequences that 
may negatively impact women, 
minorities and employees over 40.  
If discrepancies are identified, action 
is taken to adjust pay to ensure 
fairness in compensation.

•  Our Annual Incentive Plan (AIP)
rewarded 3,788 leaders in 2017.
Reflecting the company’s strong 
year, AIP funding was significantly 
above target in 2017, following 
two years of company results  
below target.

losses, 2017 was Allstate’s fourth–
highest catastrophe loss year.

•  We expanded our use of drones, 
airplanes and satellite imagery to 
quickly identify and assess damage.

•  When hurricanes brought extensive 
flooding and damage to Texas and 
Florida, Allstate did more than pay 
claims; we provided reassurance, 
relief and guidance on rebuilding. 
Our National Catastrophe Team 
sent hundreds of personnel, 
including Mobile Claim Centers

THE FUTURE OF TRANSPORTATION

“ Autonomous cars are really just the tip of the 
iceberg. We have the opportunity to create 
prosperity for virtually every family in America 
by improving the efficiency of the personal 
transportation system.” 

  — Tom Wilson

•  The value of personal transportation vehicles in 
America is $4 trillion. On average, utilization of  
personal vehicles during peak hours is only 33%.  
A 20% improvement in the efficiency of the personal 
transportation system could generate $3,000  
in savings per U.S. household each year, or $250  
per month. That is a 5% increase in household income.

•  To thrive in a multimodal world, Allstate is working  

with the public and private sectors to create the 
necessary technologies and infrastructure. We are 
committed to shaping this change, with the aim of 
improving economic mobility for millions of Americans.

DIRECTORS TO STOCKHOLDERS

The Allstate Corporation 
2775 Sanders Road 
Northbrook, IL 60062

March 28, 2018

Fellow Stockholders,
Thank you for trusting us to oversee the long-term 
health and sustainability of Allstate. We focus on 
continuous improvement and transparency, informed 
by our stockholder engagement, outside advisors and 
best practices. Below is a list of our major initiatives and 
accomplishments in 2017.
Corporate Governance
Once again last year, we reached out to stockholders 
representing over one-third of our outstanding 
shares to discuss performance, strategy, corporate 
governance, and Board composition, diversity, tenure 
and independence as part of our effort to continuously 
get better. Our Chair and CEO, Tom Wilson, Lead 
Director, Judy Sprieser, and nominating and governance 
committee chair, Andrea Redmond, participated in 
these conversations. We implemented the following 
improvements to our governance practices:
•  Board Composition – We added two new directors 

to our Board, Gregg Sherrill and Margaret Keane. 
Gregg is Executive Chairman and former CEO at 
Tenneco. His strategic, operating and leadership 
experience in the automotive industry will add to 
our capabilities and discussions, especially related 
to the rapid transformation occurring in the personal 
transportation industry. Margaret is President and 
CEO of Synchrony Financial. She is an accomplished 
leader with financial services expertise and a passion 
for innovation, customer focus and employee 
development that will further strengthen our 
operating and strategic dialogue. 

  Mary Alice Taylor and John Rowe are retiring from 

the Board in May 2018. Mary Alice has served as 
a director for 20 years under different operating 
environments and management teams. The breadth 
and depth of her Allstate experience has been 
extremely beneficial to our new directors and in 
her role leading the audit committee for the last 
three years. John joined Allstate in 2012 following 
nearly three decades as CEO of a highly regulated 
business and led our compensation and succession 
and nominating and governance committees. We are 
extremely grateful for their service and dedication 
to Allstate.

•  Board Capabilities and Refreshment – To effectively 

represent your long-term interests, we strive 
to maintain an appropriate balance of tenure, 
diversity, skill sets and experience on our Board. A 
comprehensive Board evaluation process is utilized to 
ensure governance and oversight responsibilities are 
updated and well executed. This includes assessing 
our performance at the end of every meeting, an 
annual Board assessment and individual director 
evaluations. The members of our Board reflect diverse 

2 

  www.allstate.com

perspectives, experiences and backgrounds and have 
an average tenure of 6.8 years, demonstrating our 
commitment to ensure continual refreshment. Half of 
the Board nominees are women or ethnic minorities 
who currently hold four of the Board’s leadership roles. 

•  Sustainability Report – In response to stockholder 

input, Allstate issued a Sustainability Report in 2017, 
detailing environmental, social, and governance 
practices, including diversity measures and fair 
pay practices. 

Performance and Strategy
We regularly review Allstate’s relative competitive 
positioning, and actively participate and discuss 
strategies and key initiatives for each market-facing 
business and the entire corporation. We also devoted 
significant time to Allstate’s strategy and how to 
effectively capture opportunities presented by changes 
in the automobile industry, including autonomous 
vehicle technology and ride-sharing. 
•  Allstate delivered on all five operating priorities in 

2017 which focused on both near-term performance 
and long-term value creation.
•  The Net Promoter Score, which measures 

• 

how likely customers are to recommend 
Allstate, improved.
Investment income was strong, reflecting 
equity and fixed income market 
appreciation and increased allocations to 
performance-based investments.

•  Allstate achieved its target economic returns 

on capital, despite significant catastrophe 
events. Particularly impressive was the increased 
profitability from auto insurance.

•  Total policies in force increased due to the 

acquisition of SquareTrade and continued growth 
at Allstate Benefits.

•  Long-term growth was enhanced through 

existing businesses and the creation of new 
businesses. Allstate agencies are being 
positioned as trusted advisors; Allstate Benefits 
continues to expand; SquareTrade is growing; 
and significant investments are being made in 
automotive telematics. 

Risk Oversight 
Oversight of Allstate’s enterprise risk and return 
program is the responsibility of the full Board and the 
risk and return and audit committees. We implemented 
several enhancements:
• 

Independent Review – Allstate uses economic 
capital to quantify returns and provide transparency 
into risk-return decision making. Allstate had an 

independent external review of its methodologies for 
determining economic capital and allocating it within 
the enterprise to provide insight into its business 
risk profile and risk-return opportunities. The review, 
performed by leading experts in economics and 
regulation, confirmed Allstate has a sound process 
for determining economic capital.

•  Cybersecurity Oversight – The relationship with our 

independent cybersecurity advisor, hired by the 
audit committee in 2016, was expanded in 2017 to 
further strengthen Allstate’s cybersecurity defenses 
and cybersecurity risk management practices. The 
full Board and audit committee participated in this 
important work.

Executive Compensation and Succession
We completed our annual evaluation of the executive 
compensation program to ensure alignment with long-
term interests of stockholders. The say-on-pay proposal 
received 95% support at the 2017 annual meeting. No 
significant changes were made to our programs in 2017. 
Management succession for the CEO and senior leaders 
is reviewed four times annually across multiple time 
periods (immediate, less than 2 years, 3 to 5 years, and 
over 5 years) and under different operating scenarios. 
Most recently, our robust succession strategy and careful 
planning resulted in several internal senior leadership 
promotions in connection with the retirement of Matt 
Winter, Allstate’s President, including Steve Shebik to 
Vice Chair, Glenn Shapiro to President of Allstate Personal 
Lines, and Mario Rizzo to Executive Vice President and 
Chief Financial Officer. We are confident these leadership 
changes will enable Allstate’s long-term success. 
Capital Management and Stockholder Return
Capital allocation decisions are aligned with Allstate’s 
enterprise risk and return management principles: 
maintain a strong foundation, build strategic value, and 
optimize return per unit of risk. Investments were made 
in existing businesses to support long-term profitable 
growth. With the acquisition of SquareTrade, Allstate 
expanded the protection products it offers to customers. 
•  Dividends – The quarterly dividend was increased 

12% to $0.37 cents per share in 2017. 

•  Share Repurchase Program – Allstate completed 

the $1.5 billion share repurchase authorization that 
was approved in 2016 and instituted an additional 
$2 billion share repurchase planned to be completed 
by February 2019.

•  Total Shareholder Return – Allstate achieved returns 
of 43.3%, 56.8%, and 183.7% over the last one, three 
and five years, respectively, which compares favorably 
to the company’s peers and the Standard & Poor’s 
(“S&P”) 500 index. 

Societal Responsibilities
Allstate maintains a strong reputation by operating 
with integrity, serving customers and improving local 
communities. This includes the following: 
•  Allstate was named “a most ethical company” for the 
fourth year in a row by Ethisphere Institute, a global 
leader in defining and advancing the standards of 
ethical business practices.

•  Allstate and The Allstate Foundation contributed 

more than $41 million to community service projects 
across the nation in 2017, including funding for 
more than 3,290 nonprofit organizations. Over 
4,700 Allstate agencies earned Allstate Foundation 
Helping Hands Grants to support their involvement 
in local causes.

•  The Allstate Foundation, Allstate and its employees 
and agency force contributed more than $2.1 million 
to disaster relief and recovery efforts in 2017, 
including grants to social service organizations 
and resources to help consumers navigate the 
rebuilding process. 

•  Our employees and agency force engage in 
numerous community service programs and 
volunteered over 258,000 reported hours to over 
2,430 community groups in 2017. 

We welcome your feedback on this letter or other 
matters important to Allstate. You can reach us by email 
at directors@allstate.com. 
We pledge to continue to work hard for you to 
ensure the sustainability and success of Allstate’s 
long-term strategies and commitment to enhance 
the communities it serves. Thank you for your 
continued support.

gender or ethnic diversity.

 The Board recommends a vote  FOR  each nominee.

•  Diverse slate of directors with broad leadership experience; four leadership roles bring 

•  All candidates are highly successful executives with relevant skills and expertise.
•  Average director tenure of 5.5 years with 9 of 10 independent of management.
•  Strong corporate governance practices and stockholder engagement program that 

receive exceptional corporate governance ratings.

The Board recommends 10 nominees for election to the 
Allstate Board for one-year terms beginning in May 2018 
and until a successor is duly elected and qualified or his 
or her earlier resignation or removal. These nominees 
are talented, both as individuals and as a team. They 
bring a full array of business and leadership skills to their 
oversight responsibilities. Most nominees serve on other 
public company boards, enabling our Board to more 
quickly adopt best practices from other companies. Their 
diversity of experience and expertise facilitates robust 
and thoughtful decision-making on Allstate’s Board.

Each nominee, other than Mr. Sherrill and Ms. Keane, 
was previously elected at Allstate’s annual meeting 
of stockholders on May 25, 2017, for one-year terms. 
Mr. Sherrill and Ms. Keane were elected by the 
Board effective October 1, 2017, and January 1, 2018, 
respectively. The Board expects all nominees named in 
this proxy statement to be available for election. If any 
nominee is not available, then the proxies may vote for 
a substitute. On the following pages, we list the reasons 
for nominating each individual. Mrs. Taylor is not standing 
for re-election at the annual meeting. Mr. Rowe is retiring 
at the annual meeting in accordance with Allstate’s 
retirement policy and is not standing for re-election.

Director Nominees’ Skills and Experience

strategy and contribute to the effective oversight of Allstate.

Corporate Governance  Board Composition and Nominee Considerations

Board Composition and 
Nominee Considerations

The Board and nominating and governance committee 
believe that each director should be well-versed 
in strategic oversight, corporate governance, 
stockholder advocacy, and leadership in order to be 
an effective member of the Allstate Board. In addition 
to this fundamental expertise, the Board and committee 
seek directors with experience in the areas listed on 
page 10. 

The Board and committee expect each non-employee 
director to be free of interests or affiliations that could 
give rise to a biased approach or a conflict of interest 
and be free of any significant relationship with Allstate 
that would interfere with the exercise of independent 
judgment. The Board and committee also expect each 
director to devote the time and effort necessary to serve 
as an effective director and act in a manner consistent 
with a director’s fiduciary duties of loyalty and care. 
Allstate executive officers may not serve on boards of 
other corporations whose executive officers serve on 
Allstate’s Board. 

The Board also has limits on the number of other public 
boards on which our directors may sit. Directors who are 
active executives may serve on the board of no more 
than two other public companies, and other directors 

Nomination Process for Board Election

may serve on the board of no more than four other 
public companies (in addition to Allstate’s Board in 
each case). 

Board nominees are identified through a retained 
search firm, suggestions from current directors and 
stockholders, and through other methods including 
self-nominations. Our newest directors, Ms. Keane and 
Mr. Sherrill, were identified by a search firm.

The nominating and governance committee will 
consider director candidates recommended by a 
stockholder in the same manner as all other candidates 
recommended by other sources. A stockholder may 
recommend a candidate at any time of the year by 
writing to the Office of the Secretary, The Allstate 
Corporation, 2775 Sanders Road, Suite F7, Northbrook, 
Illinois 60062-6127. 

All candidates are evaluated and considered for their 
diversity, including gender, ethnic and diversity of 
background, expertise, and perspective, as well as 
the criteria described in our Corporate Governance 
Guidelines at www.allstateinvestors.com. 

A stockholder or group of up to 20 stockholders owning 
3% or more of Allstate’s outstanding common stock 
continuously for at least three years can nominate 
director candidates constituting up to 20% of the Board 
in the company’s annual meeting proxy materials.

The Board continuously identifies potential director candidates in anticipation of retirements, resignations, or 
the need for additional capabilities. The graphic below describes the ongoing process to identify highly qualified 
candidates for Board service.

Corporate Governance  Board Leadership Structure and Practices

NOMINEE INDEPENDENCE DETERMINATIONS

The Board has determined that all non-employee 
directors who served during 2017 and all nominees, 
other than Mr. Wilson, are independent according 
to applicable law, the NYSE listing standards, and the 
Board’s Director Independence Standards (which are 
included on www.allstateinvestors.com). In accordance 
with the Director Independence Standards, the Board 
has determined that the nature of the relationships 
with the corporation that are set forth in Appendix B 
do not create a conflict of interest that would impair a 
director’s independence. The Board also determined 
that the members of the audit, compensation and 
succession, nominating and governance, and risk and 
return committees are independent within the meaning 
of applicable laws, the NYSE listing standards and the 
Director Independence Standards.

When evaluating the independence of director 
nominees, the Board weighs numerous factors, 
including tenure. In particular, the Board weighed the 
potential impact of tenure on the independence of 
our longest-serving director, Ms. Sprieser. Ms. Sprieser 
has significant experience serving at Allstate under 
different operating environments and management 
teams, and served on the Board under two CEOs 
and prior to Mr. Wilson’s appointment. The Board 
concluded that Ms. Sprieser is an effective director 
who fulfills her responsibilities with integrity and 
independence of thought. She appropriately challenges 
management and the status quo, and is reasoned, 
balanced, and thoughtful in Board deliberations and 
in communications with management. The Board 
determined that her independence from management 
has not been diminished by her years of service.

Board Leadership Structure and Practices

BOARD CHAIR

The independent directors periodically review Allstate’s 
leadership structure and whether separating the roles 
of Chair and CEO is in the best interests of Allstate and 
its stockholders. When making this determination, the 
independent directors consider the recommendation of 
the nominating and governance committee, the current 
circumstances at Allstate, the skills and experiences of 
the individuals involved and the leadership composition 
of the Board. The roles of Chair and CEO were split 
during a transition of leadership in 2007 and 2008. 
The independent directors also appoint an independent 
lead director with robust powers and responsibilities. 
A strong lead director role provides an effective 
independent counterbalance if the independent 
directors choose to combine the Chair and CEO roles.

At present, the independent directors have determined 
Allstate is well-served by having these roles performed 
by Mr. Wilson, who provides excellent leadership and 
direction for both management and the Board. This 
promotes a strong connection between the Board and 
management that is subject to strong independent 
oversight by Allstate’s independent lead director and 
the other independent directors. The Board believes 
it benefits from the considerable knowledge and 
perspective that Mr. Wilson has acquired from more 
than 23 years of insurance industry experience. Given 
his extensive company knowledge and his ability 
to effectively fulfill both roles simultaneously, he is 
uniquely qualified to lead discussions of the Board and 
is in the best position to facilitate the flow of business 
information and communications between the Board 
and management.

Board Leadership Structure and Practices  Corporate Governance

INDEPENDENT LEAD DIRECTOR

Allstate’s Board places great importance on strong independent Board leadership and has had a strong lead director 
role in place for over seven years. Allstate’s Corporate Governance Guidelines describe the responsibilities of the lead 
director and the selection process, including the characteristics that the Board considers important in a lead director.

The lead director is elected annually by the independent directors, and it is generally expected that the lead director 
serve more than one year.

Considerations in Selecting Current Lead Director

The independent directors consider several factors, including 
the director’s corporate governance expertise, operational 
and leadership experience, board service and tenure, integrity, 
prior Board leadership roles, and ability to meet the required 
time commitment. It is preferable that the lead director hold 
a previous position as chair of a Board committee, either at 
Allstate or another company. Ms. Sprieser was chosen by the 
independent directors as she exemplified these characteristics. 
She has devoted significant time fulfilling her duties as lead 
director since May of 2015. During her tenure on Allstate’s 
Board, she has cultivated an expansive knowledge of Allstate 
in multiple operating environments. Her long-term perspective 
complements the perspectives of newer Board members, seven 
of whom have joined in the last five years. The independent 
directors believe that Ms. Sprieser is exceptionally well-qualified 
to serve as Allstate’s independent lead director.

BOARD ROLE IN RISK OVERSIGHT
The Board oversees enterprise risk and return management practices (“ERRM”) and regularly reviews Allstate’s 
significant risk exposures and management’s design and implementation of ERRM. Allstate’s overall risk 
position and alignment with risk and return principles is reviewed twice a year. External resources are used when 
appropriate. Material risks, including those affected by climate, investment markets, and cybersecurity, are regularly 
identified, measured, managed, and reported to senior management and the Board.

The key risk areas overseen by each Board committee are included below.

return appetite

Current Developments in the Board’s Risk Oversight
Independent  
Risk Review

The risk and return committee oversaw an independent external review of Allstate’s methodologies for 
determining economic capital and allocating it within the enterprise to provide insight into our business risk 
profile and risk-return opportunities. The review, performed by leading experts in economics and regulation, 
confirmed Allstate has a sound process for determining economic capital.

Cybersecurity

In 2016, the audit committee engaged an independent cybersecurity advisor to provide additional 
independent oversight. This relationship was expanded in 2017 to further strengthen Allstate’s 
cybersecurity defenses and risk management practices.

Severe  
Weather Risks

The Board and risk and return committee continued to oversee efforts to assess and mitigate 
weather-related risks. The impact of several major hurricanes in 2017 validated the effectiveness of 
Allstate’s catastrophe response and risk management programs.

Board Leadership Structure and Practices  Corporate Governance

RISK MANAGEMENT AND COMPENSATION

We believe our compensation policies and practices are 
appropriately structured and do not provide incentives 
for employees to take unnecessary or excessive risks, 
utilizing analysis provided by an external consultant, the 
chief risk officer, and a review by the compensation and 
succession committee. Compensation plans provide 
a balanced and appropriate mix of cash and equity 
through annual and long-term incentives that align with 
short and long-term business goals. No one, regardless 
of eligibility, is guaranteed an award under the annual 
cash incentive program. We utilize multiple performance 
measures that correlate with long-term stockholder 
value creation and diversify the risk associated with any 
single performance indicator. In addition, the annual 
incentive program contains a funding adjustment

retention of executive talent. Management succession

for senior executives in the event of a net loss, which 
reduces the corporate pool funding for those officers 
by 50% of actual performance. Likewise, for the 
performance stock award program, the committee 
requires positive net income for our executives to earn 
awards above target. Equity awards to executive officers 
after 2009 and annual cash incentive awards beginning 
in 2010 are subject to clawback in the event of certain 
financial restatements. Executives are also subject to 
rigorous stock ownership requirements.

Based on this analysis, we believe Allstate’s 
compensation policies ensure appropriate levels of 
risk-taking, while avoiding unnecessary risks that could 
have a material adverse effect on Allstate.

Discussions cover the CEO and other senior executive 
roles and include a broader discussion on organizational 
health. The Board also has regular and direct exposure 
to senior leadership and high-potential officers through 
one-on-one breakfasts and other informal meetings held 
throughout the year.

BOARD ROLE IN SETTING COMPENSATION

The compensation and succession committee reviews 
the executive compensation program throughout 
the year with the assistance of an independent 
compensation consultant, Compensation Advisory 
Partners (“CAP”). CAP benchmarks Allstate’s plans 
and compensation payments to the market and 
evaluates changes to the executive compensation 
program. The compensation consultant also assesses 
Allstate’s executive compensation design, peer group 
selection, relative pay for performance, and total direct 
compensation for individual senior executive positions. 
Representatives of the compensation consultant 
participated in six out of seven compensation and 
succession committee meetings in 2017.

The compensation and succession committee annually 
evaluates the compensation consultant’s performance 
and independence.

The compensation and succession committee makes 
recommendations to the Board on compensation for the 
CEO and executive officers and the structure of plans 
used for executive officers.

STOCKHOLDER ENGAGEMENT

Allstate proactively discusses corporate governance 
issues with significant stockholders throughout the year. 
Dialogue, transparency, and responsiveness are the 
cornerstones of our stockholder engagement program. 
Such discussions are held before the annual meeting, 
during stockholder voting, and after the annual meeting 
and include our lead director, chair of the nominating 
and governance committee, Chair of the Board, and 
other committee chairs or directors as necessary. 
Direct engagement typically involves our largest

The compensation and succession committee has 
authority to grant equity awards to eligible employees in 
accordance with the terms of our 2013 Equity Incentive 
Plan. The Board has delegated limited authority to the 
CEO to grant equity awards to non-executive officers. All

other topics or trends stockholders may wish to share 
with us. Their input is reported to the nominating

specific issues to relevant Board committees for further 
consideration. Each Board committee reviews relevant 
feedback and determines if additional discussion or 
actions are necessary by the respective committee or 
full Board. In addition, broader investor surveys provide

Independent Lead Director

“

Oversight of risk management and strategy continued 
to be areas of focus for our Board in 2017, and significant 
time was devoted to reviewing the risks and opportunities 
presented by changes in the personal lines insurance 
industry. Management succession was also an important 
area of focus, and several senior leadership changes were 
made in early 2018, demonstrating the effectiveness 
of our management succession programs. With the 
addition of two new directors, we believe our Board is 
well positioned to oversee the long-term sustainability of 
Allstate’s business.

”

Board Meetings and Committees  Corporate Governance

Strengthened Role of Independent Committee Chairs
Each of the committee chair roles was enhanced to 
include the approval of meeting agendas and committee 
materials. Prior to each meeting, each committee chair 
has a separate conference call with the CEO and relevant 
operating executives. The committee chairs discuss 
meeting materials and agendas in advance of each 
meeting, which fosters independence and successful 
execution of each committee’s responsibilities.

Use of Independent Advisors
Each committee operates under a written charter and has 
the ability to hire third-party advisors. Outside experts 
such as independent auditors, compensation consultants, 
governance specialists, cybersecurity experts, board search 
firm representatives, and financial advisors attend meetings 
to provide directors with additional information on issues. 
All committees, other than the executive committee, used 
independent external consultants in 2017.

$6,250

compensation should be in the form of equity securities to create a

DIRECTOR STOCK OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES

Each director is expected, within five years of joining 
the Board or within five years of an increase in annual 
retainer, if applicable, to accumulate an ownership 
position in Allstate common stock equal to five times the 
annual value of the standard retainer.

(1)  Under the 2017 Equity Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors, directors may elect to receive Allstate 

common stock in lieu of cash compensation. In 2017, none of the directors elected to receive stock in lieu of 
cash. Also, under Allstate’s Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors, directors may elect to 
defer their retainers to an account that is credited or debited, as applicable, based on (a) the fair market value 
of, and dividends paid on, Allstate common shares (common share units); (b) an average interest rate calculated

on 90-day dealer commercial paper; (c) S&P 500 Index, with dividends reinvested; or (d) a money market fund. 
No director has voting or investment powers in common share units, which are payable solely in cash. Subject 
to certain restrictions, amounts deferred under the plan, together with earnings thereon, may be transferred 
between accounts and are distributed after the director leaves the Board in a lump sum or over a period not in 
excess of ten years in accordance with the director’s instructions. For 2017, Messrs. Eskew and Traquina elected 
to defer their cash retainer into common share units.

(2)  Grant date fair value for restricted stock units granted in 2017 is based on the final closing price of Allstate 

common stock on the grant dates, which in part also reflects the payment of expected future dividend 
equivalent rights. (See note 18 to our audited financial statements for 2017.) Mr. Sherrill received a prorated 
award when he joined the Board in 2017. The final grant date closing price was $86.94, except with respect to the 
prorated award granted to Mr. Sherrill, which was $91.91. The values were computed in accordance with Financial 
Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718. Each restricted stock unit entitles the 
director to receive one share of Allstate common stock on the conversion date (see footnote 3).

each director.

June 1, 2016, convert into common stock upon termination of Board service. Restricted stock units granted on 
or after June 1, 2016, convert into common stock on the earlier of the third anniversary of the date of grant or 
upon termination of Board service. Directors had the option to defer the conversion of the restricted stock units 
granted on June 1, 2016, for ten years from the date of grant or the later of termination of Board service or June 1, 
2024. The conversion of restricted stock units granted after June 1, 2016, may be deferred for ten years or until 
termination of Board service. In addition to the conversion periods described above, restricted stock units will 
convert upon death or disability. Each restricted stock unit includes a dividend equivalent right that entitles the 
director to receive a payment equal to regular cash dividends paid on Allstate common stock. Under the terms of 
the restricted stock unit awards, directors have only the rights of general unsecured creditors of Allstate and no 
rights as stockholders until delivery of the underlying shares.

 

  Non-employee directors do not receive stock options as part of their compensation as a result of a policy change 

effective on June 1, 2009. All outstanding stock options were exercisable as of December 31, 2017.

 

All outstanding options were awarded under the terms of the 2006 Equity Compensation Plan for Non-Employee 
Directors, which specifies that the exercise price for the option awards is equal to the fair market value of Allstate 
common stock on the grant date. The fair market value is equal to the closing sale price on the date of the grant. 
If there was no such sale on the grant date, then on the last previous day on which there was a sale. The options 
became exercisable in three substantially equal annual installments and expire ten years after grant. Stock 
option repricing is not permitted. An outstanding stock option will not be amended to reduce the option exercise 
price. However, the plan permits repricing in the event of an equity restructuring (such as a split) or a change in 
corporate capitalization (such as a merger).

The committee designs the executive compensation 
program to award pay in accordance with corporate, 
business unit and individual performance. A large 
percentage of total target compensation is at 

risk through long-term equity awards and annual 
cash incentive awards. These awards are linked to

2017 Performance

Mr. Wilson’s total compensation and the amount of each compensation element are driven by the design of our compensation 
program, his experience, his responsibility for Allstate’s overall strategic direction, performance and operations, and the 
committee’s analysis of peer company CEO compensation. In conjunction with the committee’s independent compensation 
consultant, the committee conducts an annual review of Mr. Wilson’s total target direct compensation and determines if any 
changes are warranted.
Mr. Wilson’s performance as Chair and CEO is evaluated under the following categories, which are determined by the 
committee: operating results, total shareholder return, developing and implementing long-term strategy, maintaining and 
motivating a high-performance team, corporate stewardship and Board effectiveness. Performance is assessed over one- and 
three-year time periods.
•  Operating Results. Achieved all five 2017 operating priorities.
•  Total Shareholder Returns. Strong shareholder returns over one, three, and five years.
•  Long-term Strategy. Improved competitive position of existing businesses and building or acquiring new long-term 

growth platforms.

•  High-Performance Team. Extremely competent, highly engaged team that had excellent operating performance.
•  Board Effectiveness. Excellent governance processes, Board diversity, and shareholder engagement.

Compensation Decisions

During the 2017 annual review, the committee determined that Mr. Wilson’s target direct compensation was appropriately 
aligned with the median of the compensation peer group. Furthermore, Mr. Wilson’s annual cash incentive target of 300% of 
salary and long-term equity incentive target of 750% of salary remained unchanged.
•  Salary. In 2017, the Board increased Mr. Wilson’s salary from $1,200,000 to $1,250,000. Mr. Wilson’s last salary increase was in 

March 2015.

•  Annual Cash Incentive Award. Mr. Wilson’s target annual incentive payment of 300% of base salary with a maximum funding 
opportunity for the award pool of 200% of target was unchanged in 2017. The committee approved an annual cash incentive 
award of $6,759,264, which was 181.4% of target and equal to the funding level as determined by the actual results for the 
four performance measures. This was 67.6% of the maximum payment established by the Board.

•  Equity Incentive Awards. In February 2017, based on its assessment of Mr. Wilson’s performance in delivering strong business 

results in 2016, the committee granted him equity awards of stock options with a grant date fair value of $3,599,997 and 
performance stock awards with a grant date fair value of $5,400,039, which was Mr. Wilson’s target equity incentive award 
opportunity of 750% of salary.

•  Other. The change in pension value for Mr. Wilson in 2017 of $1,688,142 was $2,599,785 lower than the change would have 
been had management not recommended a change in pension benefits beginning in 2014, as discussed on page 46. The 
total value of Mr. Wilson’s pension benefit as of December 31, 2017, is $16,043,029 less than it would have been without the 
2014 pension change.

INCENTIVE DESIGN AND GOAL SETTING

For the annual and long-term incentive programs, the 
committee oversees a rigorous and comprehensive 
goal-setting process. The committee works to identify 
performance measures and ranges of performance 
in the annual and long-term programs that (1) align 

with the company’s strategy, operating principles and 
priorities, and stockholder interests, (2) support the 
achievement of corporate goals, and (3) reflect the 
company’s overall performance. The following timeline of 
key events reflects the committee’s process:

2018 Proxy Statement  39

Executive Compensation  Compensation Discussion and Analysis

•  Target annual incentive percentages for each 

named executive are based on market data pay 
levels of peer companies and our benchmark 
target for total direct compensation at the 
50th percentile.

• 

Individual awards are based on job scope, market 
data, pool funding, and individual performance.

•  Allstate has established the maximum awards that 

could be paid to any of the named executives as 
the lesser of the stockholder approved maximum of 
$10 million under the Annual Executive Incentive Plan 
or a percentage of an award pool, which we refer 
to herein as the “162(m) Pool.” For 2017, the 162(m) 
Pool is equal to 1.0% of Performance Net Income 
(defined on pages 64-65), and the percentage of 
the award pool for Mr. Wilson is 35%, Mr. Winter, 
20%, and for each other named executive, 15%. 
Allstate established these maximums in order to 
qualify annual cash incentive awards for 2017 as 
deductible performance-based awards under Internal 
Revenue Code Section 162(m) as was in effect prior 
to the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the 
“Tax Legislation”). Under the Tax Legislation, the 
exemption for deductibility of performance-based 
compensation under Internal Revenue Code 
Section 162(m) has generally been eliminated for 
fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2017. The 
committee retains complete discretion to pay less 
than the maximums established by the Annual 
Executive Incentive Plan and the award pool.

Salary

• 

In setting executive salary levels, the committee 
uses the 50th percentile of total target direct 
compensation of our peer companies as a 
guideline, which supports Allstate’s ability to 
compete effectively for and to retain executive talent. 
Annual merit increases for named executives are 
based on evaluations of their performance, using the 
enterprise-wide merit increase budget as a guideline.

Annual Cash Incentive Awards

•  The committee sets performance measure goals 

based on the operating plan. Target performance is 
equal to the operating plan. Threshold and maximum 
measures are based on a range of sensitivities 
relative to the operating plan. To further test the 
appropriateness of the ranges, the committee’s 
independent consultant provides advice based on 
peer performance, market expectations and industry 
trends. The chief risk officer reviews the performance 
measures and ranges to ensure they are consistent 
with Allstate’s risk and return principles.

•  Actual performance on the performance measures 

determines the overall funding level of the corporate 
pool and the aggregate total award budget for 
eligible employees. In 2017, the pool was funded 
based on the collective results of four measures: 
Performance Net Income, Total Premiums, Net 
Investment Income, and Total Return. Funding for 
each measure is equal to 0% below threshold, 50% 
at threshold, 100% at target and 200% at maximum, 
and results between threshold, target and maximum 
are subject to interpolation.

• 

In the event of a net loss, the corporate pool funding 
is reduced by 50% of actual performance for senior 
executives. For example, if performance measures 
ordinarily would fund the corporate pool at 60% 
and there was a net loss, then the corporate pool 
would be funded at 30% for senior executives. 
This mechanism ensures alignment of pay and 
performance in the event of a natural catastrophe or 
extreme financial market conditions.

•  We paid the 2017 cash incentive awards in March 2018. The following table shows how the corporate pool was 

funded and distributed to individual participants:

Compensation Discussion and Analysis  Executive Compensation

Formulaic Calculation of

Actual performance is determined 
after the end of the performance 
period. The pool available for

accordance with a formula based 
on four performance measures.

Performance Net Income 
(aligns with stockholders’ 
expectations of current 
performance) (43%)(1)

Total Premiums 
(captures growth and competitive 
position of the businesses) (43%)(1)

Net Investment Income 
(reflects a significant component 
of profitability) (10%)(1) 

Total Return 
(captures all investment results 
for the business) (4%)(1)

Annual Corporate Pool Distribution 

1.  Committee approves corporate pool based on review of actual 

performance in comparison to goals.

2.  CEO allocates corporate pool between Market-Facing Businesses and 
Areas of Responsibility based on relative performance against annual 
operating goals, for participants other than senior executives.
• 

In 2017, the CEO did not exercise discretion in allocating pool 
funding between the Market-Facing Businesses or Areas 
of Responsibility.

3.  Committee’s compensation recommendations for the CEO are 

reviewed and approved by the independent directors of our Board in 
executive session.

4.  Committee reviews and approves CEO recommendations for 

executive officers based on individual performance.

5.  Individual awards for other employees are determined by senior 
leaders of Market-Facing Businesses and Areas of Responsibility 
and are subject to approval by CEO – senior leaders are tasked to 
ensure high-performing participants earn awards (as a percent 
of funding) that are at least 2.0 times the awards earned by 
lower-performing participants for the annual incentive plan. 
The same level of discretion is targeted for equity components 
of compensation.

(1)  The committee has discretion to determine the amount of the awards paid from the corporate pool to the 
named executives. For treatment of catastrophe losses and performance-based long-term income in the 
funding calculation, see discussion of performance measures on pages 64-67.

Performance Stock Awards and Stock Options

•  We grant equity awards annually to executives 

consistent with market practice and our philosophy 
that a significant amount of compensation should be 
in the form of equity. Additionally, from time to time, 
equity awards are granted to attract new executives 
and to retain existing executives.

•  Since 2016, the mix of equity incentives for 

senior executives has been 60% PSAs and 40% 

stock options. We believe both PSAs and stock 
options are forms of performance-based incentive 
compensation because PSAs are earned based 
on achieving established performance goals and 
stock options require stock price appreciation to 
deliver value to an executive. The PSAs vest based 
on results for Performance Net Income ROE (70%) 
and Earned Book Value (30%) over the three-year 
measurement period. The actual number of PSAs 
vesting is between 0% to 200% of target number of 
PSAs granted.

2018 Proxy Statement  41

Executive Compensation  Compensation Discussion and Analysis

•  The committee requires positive net income in 
order for our executives to earn PSAs based on 
Performance Net Income ROE above target. If 
Allstate has a net loss in a measurement period, the 
number of PSAs vested would not exceed target, 
regardless of the Performance Net Income ROE. This 
positive Net Income hurdle is included to prevent 
misalignment between Allstate reported net income 
and the PSAs vested based on the Performance Net 
Income ROE result. This situation could occur if, for 
example, catastrophe losses or capital losses that 
are not included in Performance Net Income ROE 
caused Allstate to report a net loss for the period.

•  At the end of each measurement period, the 

committee certifies the level of our Performance Net 
Income ROE and Earned Book Value achievement. 
PSAs will vest following the end of the three-year 
performance cycle if the performance conditions 
are met, subject to continued employment (other 
than in the event of death, disability, retirement, or a 
qualifying termination following a change in control).

•  The committee selected Performance Net Income 

ROE as a performance measure because it:

•  Measures performance in a way that is tracked 

and understood by investors.

•  Captures both income and balance sheet 

impacts, including capital management actions.

•  Provides a useful gauge of overall performance 

while limiting the effects of factors 
management cannot influence, such as 
extreme weather conditions.

•  Correlates to changes in long-term 

stockholder value.

•  Earned Book Value was selected to create greater 
alignment with the increase in performance-based 
assets in the investment portfolio.

•  Both measures are further described on pages 64-67. 

For both measures, the committee considered 
historical and expected performance, market 
expectations and industry trends when approving 
the range of performance.

•  For awards granted in 2015, the number of PSAs 
that vested depended on the three-year Average 
Performance Net Income ROE. Performance Net 
Income ROE for 2015 is defined on pages 64-67.

•  For all PSA awards, Performance Net Income and 

Earned Book Value include a minimum or maximum 
amount of after-tax catastrophe losses if actual 
catastrophe losses are less than or exceed those 
amounts, respectively, which serves to decrease 
volatility and stabilize the measure.

Retention Requirements

Timing of Equity Awards and Grant Practices

Allstate no longer utilizes additional equity holding 
requirements for any equity awards outstanding. Allstate 
previously required, regardless of stock ownership level, 
senior executives to retain 75% of net shares received 
as a result of equity compensation awards for one 
year. After benchmarking peers and reviewing leading 
practices, it was determined that the additional equity 
holding requirements are not aligned with the market, 
and are a minority practice.

Policies on Hedging and Pledging Securities

We have a policy that prohibits all officers, directors, and 
employees from engaging in transactions in securities 
issued by Allstate or any of its subsidiaries that might be 
considered speculative or hedging, such as selling short 
or buying or selling options. We also have a policy that 
prohibits senior executives and directors from pledging 
Allstate securities as collateral for a loan or holding such 
securities in a margin account, unless an exception is 
granted by the Chair or lead director.

Typically, the committee approves grants of equity 
awards during a meeting in the first fiscal quarter. The 
timing allows the committee to align awards with our 
annual performance and business goals. 

Throughout the year, the committee may grant equity 
incentive awards to newly hired or promoted executives 
or to retain or recognize executives. The grant date for 
these awards was fixed as the third business day of a 
month following the later of committee action or the 
date of hire or promotion, or for recognition grants, such 
other date specified by the committee. 

For additional information on the committee’s practices, 
see portions of the Board Leadership Structure 
and Practices section of this proxy statement on 
pages 21-22, and 24.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis  Executive Compensation

Peer Benchmarking

The committee monitors performance toward goals 
throughout the year and reviews the executive 
compensation program design and executive 
pay levels annually. As part of that evaluation, 
Compensation Advisory Partners, the committee’s 
independent compensation consultant, provided 
executive compensation data, information on current 
market practices, and alternatives to consider when 
determining compensation for our named executives. 
The committee benchmarks executive compensation 
program design, executive pay, and performance 
against a group of peer companies that are publicly 

Peer Companies(1)

traded. Product mix, market segment, annual revenues, 
premiums, assets, and market value were considered 
when identifying peer companies. The committee 
believes Allstate competes against these companies for 
executive talent, business and stockholder investment. 
The committee reviews the composition of the peer 
group annually with the assistance of its compensation 
consultant. In 2017, the committee made one change 
to the peer group. CNA Financial Corporation is now 
included in the peer group for 2017 compensation 
benchmarking. The following table reflects the peer 
group used for 2017 compensation benchmarking. No 
changes were made to the peer group for 2018.

Information as of year-end 2017.

In its executive pay discussions, the committee also 
reviewed compensation information for 19 general 
industry companies in the S&P 100 with fiscal year 
2016 revenues between $16 billion and $56 billion. The 
committee uses compensation surveys for certain 
executives that provide information on companies of 
similar size and business mix as Allstate, as well as 
companies with a broader market context.

The committee uses the 50th percentile of our peer 
group as a guideline in setting the target total direct 
compensation of our named executives. Within the 
guideline, the committee balances the various elements 
of compensation based on individual experience, 
job scope and responsibilities, performance, and 
market practices.

Other Elements of Compensation

To remain competitive with other employers and to attract, retain, and motivate highly talented executives and 
other employees, we offer the benefits listed in the following table.

Certain Managers

All Full-time and 
Regular Part-time

(1)  Allstate contributed $0.80 for every dollar of matchable pre-tax or Roth 401(k) deposits made in 2017 (up to 5% of 

(2) 

eligible pay).
Including medical, dental, vision, life, accidental death and dismemberment, long-term disability, and group legal 
insurance. For named executives and other senior officers, Allstate offers an executive physical program.

(3)  All officers are eligible for tax preparation services. Financial planning services were provided only to 

senior executives.

(4)  The Board encourages the CEO to use our corporate aircraft when it improves his efficiency in managing the 

company, even if it is for personal purposes. Personal usage is counted as taxable compensation. The committee 
also approved the President’s usage of corporate aircraft for personal use up to 40 hours annually. In limited 
circumstances approved by the CEO, other senior executives are permitted to use our corporate aircraft for 
personal purposes. Ground transportation is available to senior executives. Mobile devices are available to senior 
executives, other officers, and certain managers and employees depending on their job responsibilities. 

(5)  Tickets to Allstate-sponsored events or the Allstate Arena are offered as recognition for service.

Retirement Benefits

Change-in-Control and Post-Termination Benefits

Consistent with our compensation objectives, we 
offer these benefits to attract, motivate, and retain 
executives. A change in control of Allstate could have a 
disruptive impact on both Allstate and our executives. 
Change-in-control benefits and post-termination 
benefits are designed to mitigate that impact and 
to maintain alignment between the interests of our 
executives and our stockholders.

The following summarizes Allstate’s change-in-control 
benefits for the executive officers:

•  The change-in-control severance plan (CIC Plan) does 
not include excise tax gross ups or a lump sum cash 
pension enhancement.

•  For the CEO, the amount of cash severance payable 

is three times the sum of base salary and target 
annual incentive. For the other executive officers, the 
amount of cash severance payable is two times the 
sum of base salary and target annual incentive.

Each named executive participates in two different 
defined benefit pension plans. The Allstate Retirement 
Plan (ARP) is a tax qualified defined benefit pension 
plan available to all of our regular full-time and regular 
part-time employees who meet certain age and service 
requirements. The ARP provides an assured retirement 
income based on an employee’s level of compensation 
and length of service at no cost to the employee. As the 
ARP is a tax qualified plan, federal tax law limits (1) the 
amount of an individual’s compensation that can be used 
to calculate plan benefits and (2) the total amount of 
benefits payable to a plan participant on an annual basis. 
For certain employees, these limits may result in a lower 
benefit under the ARP than would have been payable 
otherwise. Therefore, the Supplemental Retirement 
Income Plan (SRIP) is used to provide ARP-eligible 
employees whose compensation or benefit amount 
exceeds the federal limits with an additional defined 
benefit in an amount equal to what would have been 
payable under the ARP if the federal limits did not exist. 
Effective January 1, 2014, Allstate modified its defined 
benefit pension plans so that all eligible employees earn 
future pension benefits under a new cash balance formula.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis  Executive Compensation

• 

In order to receive the cash severance benefits 
under the CIC Plan, a participant must have been 
terminated (other than for cause, death, or disability) 
or the participant must have terminated employment 
for good reason (such as adverse changes in the 
terms or conditions of employment, including a 
material reduction in base compensation, a material 
change in authority, duties, or responsibilities, or 
a material change in job location) within two years 
following a change in control.

•  Long-term equity incentive awards vest on an 

accelerated basis due to a change in control only 
if the participant has been terminated (other than 
for cause, death, or disability) or the participant 
terminated employment for good reason (as defined 
above) within two years following a change in control.

The change-in-control and post-termination 
arrangements that are described in the Potential 
Payments as a Result of Termination or Change in 
Control section on pages 60-62 are not provided 
exclusively to the named executives. A larger group of 
management employees is eligible to receive many of 
the post-termination benefits described in that section.

Clawback of Compensation

Awards made to executive officers after May 19, 2009, 
under short- and long-term incentive compensation 
plans, are subject to clawback in the event of certain 
financial restatements. Annual cash incentive and equity 
awards granted after May 19, 2009, are also subject to 
cancellation or recovery in certain circumstances if the 
recipient violates non-solicitation covenants. Equity 
awards granted after February 21, 2012, are subject to 
cancellation in certain circumstances if the recipient 
violates non-competition covenants.

Impact of Tax Considerations on Compensation

In 2017, we were able to take a tax deduction of no 
more than $1 million per executive for compensation 
paid in any year to our CEO and the three other 
most highly compensated executives, excluding any 
individual that served as CFO during the year, as of the 
last day of the fiscal year in which the compensation 

is otherwise deductible, unless the compensation 
met specific standards. Under Internal Revenue Code 
Section 162(m) as in effect before the passage of the 
Tax Legislation, we were able to deduct more than 
$1 million in compensation if the compensation was 
performance-based and paid under a plan that met 
certain requirements. The committee considered the 
impact of this Internal Revenue Code rule in developing, 
implementing, and administering our compensation 
programs for 2017. Under the Tax Legislation, the 
exemption for deductibility of performance-based 
compensation under Internal Revenue Code 
Section 162(m) has generally been eliminated for fiscal 
years beginning after December 31, 2017. The committee 
has and will continue to consider the deductibility of 
compensation, including in light of the revisions to 
Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m). However, the 
committee balances this consideration with our primary 
goals of structuring compensation programs to attract, 
motivate and retain executives and ensuring that 
pay aligns with performance. In light of this balance 
and the need to maintain flexibility in administering 
compensation programs, the committee may authorize 
compensation in any year that exceeds $1 million for 
which we may not be able to recognize a tax deduction.

Earned Annual Cash Incentive Awards

In 2017, the total corporate pool was based on four 
measures: Performance Net Income, Total Premiums, 
Net Investment Income, and Total Return. The 2017 
annual incentive plan targets for Net Investment 
Income and Total Return were both lower than actual 
2016 performance to reflect the business and market 
conditions in the operating plan. Modest adjustments 
were made to the range between threshold and 
maximum for each of the performance measures in 
alignment with the operating plan and the probability of 
achieving the results.

The 2018 annual incentive plan targets are not included 
since those targets do not relate to 2017 pay, and 
because target performance is set at the 2018 operating 
plan, which is proprietary information.

(1)  Mr. Dugenske received a sign-on bonus in connection with the commencement of his employment on March 1, 2017. 

The cash bonus is payable in two installments. The first installment was paid within sixty days of his start date, and 
the second installment will be paid within thirty days after the first anniversary of his start date.

(2)  Mr. Dugenske received a sign-on grant of restricted stock units on April 5, 2017. These RSUs will become 100% 

vested on April 4, 2020.

(3)  The aggregate grant date fair value of PSAs granted in 2017, 2016, and 2015, and the RSUs granted in 2017 
to Mr. Dugenske, is computed in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting 
Standards Codification Topic 718 (ASC 718). The fair value of PSAs and RSUs is based on the final closing price 
of Allstate’s common stock on the grant date, which in part reflects the payment of expected future dividends. 
(See note 18 to our audited financial statements for 2017). This amount reflects an accounting expense and does 
not correspond to actual value that will be realized by the named executives. The value of PSAs is based on 
the probable satisfaction of the performance conditions. The number of PSAs granted in 2017 to each named 
executive, and RSUs granted in 2017 to Mr. Dugenske, is provided in the Grants of Plan-Based Awards table on 
page 52. The value of the PSAs granted in 2017 at grant date share price if maximum corporate performance 
were to be achieved is as follows: Mr. Wilson $10,800,078, Mr. Shebik $3,990,052, Mr. Civgin $2,808,064, 
Mr. Dugenske $2,610,024 and Mr. Winter $3,712,536.

(4)  The aggregate grant date fair value of option awards is computed in accordance with FASB ASC 718. The fair 

value of each option award is estimated on the grant date using a binomial lattice model and the assumptions 
(see note 18 to our audited financial statements for 2017) as set forth in the following table:

Weighted average expected term
Expected volatility

Summary Compensation Table  Executive Compensation

 

This amount reflects an accounting expense and does not correspond to actual value that will be realized by the 
named executives. The number of options granted in 2017 to each named executive is provided in the Grants of 
Plan-Based Awards table on page 52.

(5)  Amounts reflect the aggregate increase in actuarial value of the pension benefits as set forth in the Pension 

Benefits table, accrued during 2017, 2016, and 2015. These are benefits under the Allstate Retirement Plan (ARP) 
and the Supplemental Retirement Income Plan (SRIP). Non-qualified deferred compensation earnings are not 
reflected since our Deferred Compensation Plan does not provide above-market earnings. The pension plan 
measurement date is December 31. (See note 17 to our audited financial statements for 2017.)

 

 

 

The following table reflects the respective change in the actuarial value of the benefits provided to the named 
executives in 2017:

Interest rates and other assumptions can have a significant impact on the change in pension value from one year 
to another.

Effective January 1, 2014, Allstate modified its pension plans so that all eligible employees earn future pension 
benefits under a new cash balance formula. The change in actuarial value of benefits provided for each named 
executive in 2017 would have been as indicated in the following table under the prior formula:

(1)  The amount reported for personal use of aircraft is based on the incremental cost method, which is 

calculated based on Allstate’s average variable costs per flight hour. Variable costs include fuel, maintenance, 
on-board catering, landing/ramp fees, and other miscellaneous variable costs. The total annual variable costs 
are divided by the annual number of flight hours flown by the aircraft to derive an average variable cost per 
flight hour. This average variable cost per flight hour is then multiplied by the flight hours flown for personal 
use to derive the incremental cost. This method of calculating the incremental cost excludes fixed costs that 
do not change based on usage, such as pilots’ and other employees’ salaries, costs incurred in purchasing 
the aircraft, and non-trip-related hangar expenses.

(2)  Each of the named executives participated in our 401(k) plan during 2017. The amount shown is the amount 

allocated to their accounts as employer matching contributions. Mr. Dugenske will not be vested in the 
employer matching contribution until he has completed three years of vesting service.

2018 Proxy Statement  51

Executive Compensation  Grants of Plan-Based Awards at Fiscal Year-end 2017

(3) 

“Other” consists of personal benefits and perquisites related to mobile devices, tax preparation services, 
financial planning, ground transportation, executive physical related items and supplemental long-term 
disability coverage. There was no incremental cost for the use of mobile devices. We provide supplemental 
long-term disability coverage to all regular full- and part-time employees who participate in the long-term 
disability plan and whose annual earnings exceed the level that produces the maximum monthly benefit 
provided by the long-term disability plan. This coverage is self-insured (funded and paid for by Allstate when 
obligations are incurred). No obligations for the named executives were incurred in 2017, and therefore, no 
incremental cost is reflected in the table.

(7)  We have included an additional column to show total compensation minus the change in pension value. The 

amounts reported in this column may differ substantially from, and are not a substitute for, the amounts 
reported in the “Total” column required under SEC rules. The change in pension value is subject to several 
external variables, including interest rates, that are not related to company or individual performance and may 
differ significantly based on the formula under which the benefits were earned.

(1)  Awards under the Annual Executive Incentive Plan and the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan.
(2)  The amounts in these columns consist of the threshold, target, and maximum annual cash incentive awards for 

the named executives. The threshold amount for each named executive is 50% of target, as the minimum amount 
payable (subject to individual performance) if threshold performance is achieved. If the threshold is not achieved, the 
payment to the named executives would be zero. The target amount is based upon achievement of the performance

measures listed under the Earned Annual Cash Incentive Awards caption on page 47. The maximum amount is 
based on the maximum amount that could be paid to a named executive to qualify the annual cash incentive award 
as deductible under section 162(m) as in effect prior to the passage of the Tax Legislation. The maximum amount 
payable to any named executive who served as CFO during the year is an amount equal to 15% of the 162(m) Pool 
described on pages 64-65. The maximum amount payable to the CEO and the three most highly compensated 
executives, excluding any named executive who served as CFO during the year, is the lesser of a stockholder-
approved maximum of $10 million under the Annual Executive Incentive Plan or a percentage, which varies by 
executive, of the award pool. The award pool is equal to 1.0% of Performance Net Income with award opportunities 
capped at 35% of the pool for Mr. Wilson, 20% for Mr. Winter, and 15% of the pool for each other named executive. 
Performance Net Income is defined on pages 64-65. For a description of the ranges of performance established by 
the committee for the 2017 annual incentive, which are lower than the section 162(m) limits, see page 48.

(3)  The amounts shown in these columns reflect the threshold, target, and maximum PSAs for the named executives. 
The threshold amount for each named executive is 0% payout. The target and maximum amounts are based upon 
achievement of the performance measures listed under the Performance Stock Awards caption on page 48.

(4)  Mr. Dugenske received a sign-on grant of restricted stock units on April 5, 2017. These RSUs will become 100% 

vested on April 4, 2020. 

(5)  The exercise price of each option is equal to the closing sale price on the New York Stock Exchange on the grant 

date or, if there was no such sale on the grant date, then on the last previous day on which there was a sale.

(6)  The aggregate grant date fair value of the PSAs was $78.35 and stock option awards was $14.49, with the 

exception of Mr. Dugenske’s, which for the PSAs was $81.86, the stock option award was $15.12, and the RSUs 
was $81.42, computed in accordance with FASB ASC 718 based on the probable satisfaction of the performance 
conditions. The assumptions used in the valuation are discussed in footnotes 3 and 4 to the Summary 
Compensation Table on page 50.

PERFORMANCE STOCK AWARDS (“PSAs”)
PSAs represent our promise to transfer shares of common stock in the future if certain performance measures 
are met. For the awards granted in 2017, the actual number of PSAs that vest will vary from 0% to 200% of target 
PSAs based on Average Performance Net Income ROE (70%) and Earned Book Value (30%) results for a three-year 
measurement period. For a definition of how those measures are calculated, see pages 64-67. Each PSA represents 
Allstate’s promise to transfer one fully vested share in the future for each PSA that vests. Vested PSAs will be 
converted into shares of Allstate common stock and dividend equivalents accrued on these shares will be paid 
in cash. No dividend equivalents will be paid prior to vesting. PSAs will vest following the end of the three-year 
performance cycle if the performance conditions are met, subject to continued employment (other than in the event 
of death, disability, retirement, or a qualifying termination following a change in control).

STOCK OPTIONS
Stock options represent an opportunity to buy shares of our stock at a fixed exercise price at a future date. We use 
them to align the interests of our executives with long-term stockholder value, as the stock price must appreciate 
from the grant date for the executives to profit.

Under our stockholder-approved equity incentive plan, the exercise price cannot be less than the closing price of a 
share on the grant date. Stock option repricing is not permitted. In other words, without an event such as a stock 
split, if the committee cancels an award and substitutes a new award, the exercise price of the new award cannot be 
less than the exercise price of the canceled award.

All stock option awards have been made in the form of non-qualified stock options. The options granted to the 
named executives beginning in 2014 become exercisable over three years. One-third of the stock options will 
become exercisable on the anniversary of the grant date for each of the three years. The change to the vesting 
schedule beginning in 2014 was made to reflect current market practice. For the vesting schedule for other option 
grants, see footnote 1 to the Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-end 2017 table. All of the options expire ten 
years from the grant date, unless an earlier date has been approved by the committee in connection with certain 
change-in-control situations or other special circumstances such as termination, death, or disability.

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS
Each restricted stock unit represents our promise to transfer one fully vested share of stock in the future if and when 
the restrictions expire (when the unit “vests”). Under the terms of the restricted stock unit award, the executive 
has only the rights of a general unsecured creditor of Allstate and no rights as a stockholder until delivery of the 
underlying shares. The restricted stock units granted to Mr. Dugenske in 2017 will become 100% vested on the day 
prior to the third anniversary of the grant date, except in certain change-in-control situations or under other special 
circumstances approved by the Committee. The restricted stock units granted to Mr. Dugenske include the right to 
receive previously accrued dividend equivalents payable in cash when the underlying restricted stock units vest.

of the grant date for each of the three years. The options granted in 2012 and 2013 vest over four years: 50% on 
the second anniversary date and 25% on each of the third and fourth anniversary dates. The other options vest 
in four installments of 25% on each of the first four anniversaries of the grant date. The exercise price of each 
option is equal to the closing price of Allstate’s common stock on the grant date. If there was no sale on the 
grant date, the closing price is calculated as of the last previous day on which there was a sale.

(1)  These amounts are estimates and do not necessarily reflect the actual amounts that will be paid to the named 

executives, which will be known only at the time they become eligible for payment. The present value of the 
accumulated benefit was determined using the same measurement date (December 31, 2017) and material 
assumptions that we use for year-end financial reporting purposes, except that we made no assumptions for 
early termination, disability, or pre-retirement mortality. Other assumptions include the following:
•  Retirement at the normal retirement age as defined in the plans (age 65).
•  Discount rate of 3.68%.

  Other assumptions for the final average pay formula include the following:

•  80% paid as a lump sum and 20% paid as an annuity; for the cash balance formula, 100% paid as a lump sum.
•  ARP lump-sum/annuity conversion segmented interest rates of 2.50% for the first five years, 4.75% for the next 

15 years, and 5.50% for all years after 20.

•  SRIP lump-sum conversion segmented interest rates of 2.00% for the first five years, 4.50% for the next 15 

years, and 5.50% for all years after 20.

•  Lump-sum calculations were done using the IRS Section 417(e)(3) mortality table projected with the MP-2017 

projection table. Allstate adopted this table for accounting on December 31, 2017, to measure retirement 
program obligations in the United States.

•  Annuity calculations were done using the RP-2014 white-collar mortality table for annuitants projected with 

the MP-2017 projection table.

See note 17 to our audited financial statements for 2017 for additional information.

 
(2)  The following table shows the lump-sum present value of the non-qualified pension benefits for each named 
executive earned through December 31, 2017, if the named executive’s employment terminated on that date.

The amount shown is based on the lump-sum methodology used by the Allstate pension plans in 2018. 
Specifically, the interest rate for 2018 is based on 100% of the average corporate bond segmented yield curve 
from August of the prior year. As required under the Internal Revenue Code, the mortality table used for 2018 
is the 2018 combined static Pension Protection Act funding mortality table with a blend of 50% males and 
50% females.

(3)  Mr. Dugenske was not a member of the ARP or the SRIP in 2017 and therefore had not accrued a benefit under 

the ARP or the SRIP.

ALLSTATE RETIREMENT PLAN (ARP)

Contributions to the ARP are made entirely by Allstate 
and are paid into a trust fund from which benefits are 
paid. Before January 1, 2014, ARP participants earned 
benefits under one of two formulas (final average pay or 
cash balance) based on their date of hire or their choice 
at the time Allstate introduced the cash balance formula. 
In order to better align our pension benefits with 
market practices, provide future pension benefits more 
equitably to Allstate employees, and reduce costs, final 
average pay benefits were frozen as of December 31, 
2013. As of January 1, 2014, all eligible participants earn 
benefits under a cash balance formula only.

Final Average Pay Formula — Frozen as of 
12/31/13

Benefits under the final average pay formula were 
earned and are stated in the form of a straight life 
annuity payable at the normal retirement age of 65. 
Messrs. Shebik and Wilson have earned final average 
pay benefits equal to the sum of a Base Benefit and an 
Additional Benefit. The Base Benefit equals 1.55% of the 
participant’s average annual compensation, multiplied 
by credited service after 1988 through 2013. The 
Additional Benefit equals 0.65% of the amount of the 
participant’s average annual compensation that exceeds 
the participant’s covered compensation, multiplied 
by credited service after 1988 through 2013. Covered 
compensation is the average of the maximum annual 
salary taxable for Social Security over the 35-year period 
ending the year the participant would reach Social 
Security retirement age. Messrs. Shebik and Wilson are 

eligible for a reduced early retirement benefit which 
would reduce their Base Benefit by 4.8% for each year of 
early payment before age 65 and their Additional Benefit 
by 8% for each year of early payment from age 62 to age 
65 and 4% for each year of early payment from age 55 to 
age 62, prorated on a monthly basis based on age at the 
date payments begin.

Cash Balance Formula — For all Participants 
Beginning 1/1/14

All named executives, except Mr. Dugenske, earned 
benefits under the cash balance formula in 2017. 
Mr. Dugenske will earn benefits under the cash balance 
formula after completing one year of vesting service.
Under this formula, participants receive pay credits while 
employed at Allstate, based on a percentage of eligible 
annual compensation and years of service, plus interest 
credits. Pay credits are allocated to a hypothetical 
account in an amount equal to 3% to 5% of eligible 
annual compensation, depending on years of vesting 
service. Interest credits are allocated to the hypothetical 
account based on the interest crediting rate in effect 
for that plan year as published by the Internal Revenue 
Service. The interest crediting rate is set annually and 
is currently based on the average yield for 30-year U.S. 
Treasury securities for August of the prior year. Prior to 
2014, Messrs. Civgin and Winter earned cash balance 
credits equal to 2.5% of eligible annual compensation 
after they completed one year of vesting service based 
on the prior cash balance formula.

SUPPLEMENTAL RETIREMENT INCOME PLAN (SRIP)

SRIP benefits are generally determined using a 
two-step process: (1) determine the amount that would 
be payable under the ARP formula(s) specified above 
if Internal Revenue Code limits did not apply, then 
(2) reduce the amount described in (1) by the amount 
actually payable under the applicable ARP formula(s). 

The normal retirement date under the SRIP is age 65. 
If eligible for early retirement under the ARP, the 
employee also is eligible for early retirement under the 
SRIP. SRIP benefits are not funded and are paid out of 
Allstate’s general assets.

2018 Proxy Statement  57

Executive Compensation  Retirement Benefits

CREDITED SERVICE

No additional service credit beyond service with Allstate 
or its predecessors is granted under the ARP or the 
SRIP to any of the named executives. Messrs. Shebik 
and Wilson have combined service with Allstate and 
its former parent company, Sears, Roebuck and Co., of 
29.2 and 24.8 years, respectively. As a result, a portion 
of their retirement benefits will be paid from the Sears 
pension plan. Consistent with the pension benefits of 

other employees with Sears service who were employed 
by Allstate at the time of the spin-off from Sears in 1995, 
Messrs. Shebik’s and Wilson’s final average pay pension 
benefits under the ARP and the SRIP are calculated 
as if each had worked his combined Sears-Allstate 
career with Allstate through December 31, 2013, and 
then are reduced by amounts earned under the Sears 
pension plan.

ELIGIBLE COMPENSATION

Under both the ARP and SRIP, eligible compensation 
consists of salary, annual cash incentive awards, and 
certain other forms of compensation, but does not 
include long-term cash incentive awards or income 
related to equity awards. Compensation used to 
determine benefits under the ARP is limited in 

PAYMENT OPTIONS

accordance with the Internal Revenue Code. For final 
average pay benefits, average annual compensation 
is the average compensation of the five highest 
consecutive calendar years within the last ten 
consecutive calendar years through 2013.

Payment options under the ARP include a lump sum, 
straight life annuity, and various survivor annuity 
options. The lump sum under the final average pay 
benefit is calculated in accordance with the applicable 
interest rate and mortality assumptions as required 
under the Internal Revenue Code. The lump-sum 

payment under the cash balance benefit is generally 
equal to a participant’s account balance. Payments 
from the SRIP are paid in the form of a lump sum using 
the same interest rate and mortality assumptions used 
under the ARP.

TIMING OF PAYMENTS

Eligible employees are vested in the normal ARP and 
SRIP retirement benefits on the earlier of the completion 
of three years of service or upon reaching age 65.

Final average pay benefits are payable at age 65. A 
participant with final average pay benefits may be 
entitled to a reduced early retirement benefit on or 
after age 55 if he or she terminates employment after 
completing 20 or more years of vesting service.

A participant earning cash balance benefits who 
terminates employment with at least three years of 
vesting service is entitled to a lump sum benefit equal to 
his or her cash balance account balance.

The following SRIP payment dates assume a retirement 
or termination date of December 31, 2017:

•  Messrs. Shebik’s and Wilson’s SRIP benefits earned 

prior to 2005 would become payable as early as 
January 1, 2018. Benefits earned after 2004 would be 
paid on July 1, 2018, or following death.

•  Mr. Civgin’s SRIP benefit would be paid on 

July 1, 2018, or following death.

•  Mr. Dugenske is not currently a member of the 

SRIP and therefore has not accrued a benefit under 
the SRIP.

•  Mr. Winter’s SRIP benefit would be paid on 

July 1, 2018, or following death.

(1)  Aggregate earnings were not included in the named executive’s compensation in the last completed fiscal year 

in the Summary Compensation Table.

(2)  There are no amounts reported in the Aggregate Balance at Last FYE column that previously were reported as 

compensation in the Summary Compensation Table.

In order to remain competitive with other employers, we 
allow the named executives and other employees whose 
annual compensation exceeds the amount specified in 
the Internal Revenue Code ($270,000 in 2017), to defer 
under the Deferred Compensation Plan up to 80% 
of their salary and/or up to 100% of their annual cash 
incentive award that exceeds the Internal Revenue Code 
limit. Allstate does not match participant deferrals and 
does not guarantee a stated rate of return.

Deferrals under the Deferred Compensation Plan are 
credited with earnings or debited for losses based 
on the results of the notional investment option or 
options selected by the participants. The notional 
investment options available in 2017 under the Deferred 
Compensation Plan are: stable value, S&P 500, 
international equity, Russell 2000, mid-cap, and bond 
funds. Under the Deferred Compensation Plan, deferrals 
are not actually invested in these funds, but instead 
are credited with earnings or debited for losses based 
on the funds’ investment returns. Because the rate of 
return is based on actual investment measures in our 
401(k) plan, no above-market earnings are credited, 
recorded, or paid. Our Deferred Compensation Plan and 
401(k) plan allow participants to change their investment 
elections daily, subject to certain trading restrictions.

The Deferred Compensation Plan is unfunded. This 
means that Allstate does not set aside funds for the 
plan in a trust or otherwise. Participants have only the 
rights of general unsecured creditors and may lose their 
balances in the event of the company’s bankruptcy. 
Account balances are 100% vested at all times.

An irrevocable distribution election is required before 
making any deferrals into the plan. Generally, a named 
executive may elect to begin receiving a distribution of 
his or her account balance immediately upon separation 
from service or in one of the first through fifth years after 
separation from service. The earliest distribution date 
for deferrals on or after January 1, 2005, and earnings 
and losses on these amounts, is six months following 
separation from service. The named executive may elect 
to receive payment in a lump sum or in annual cash 
installment payments over a period of two to ten years. 
In addition, a named executive may elect an in-service 
withdrawal of his or her entire balance earned and 
vested prior to January 1, 2005, and earnings and losses 
on these amounts, subject to forfeiture of 10% of such 
balance. Upon proof of an unforeseen emergency, a plan 
participant may be allowed to access certain funds in a 
deferred compensation account earlier than the dates 
specified above.

(2) 

Includes both voluntary and involuntary termination. Examples of involuntary termination independent of a 
change in control include performance-related terminations; terminations for employee dishonesty and violation 
of Allstate rules, regulations, or policies; and terminations resulting from lack of work, rearrangement of work, or 
reduction in force. 
In general, a change in control is one or more of the following events: (1) any person acquires 30% or more of the 
combined voting power of Allstate common stock within a 12-month period; (2) any person acquires more than 
50% of the combined voting power of Allstate common stock; (3) certain changes are made to the composition 
of the Board; or (4) the consummation of a merger, reorganization, or similar transaction. These triggers were 
selected because any of these could cause a substantial change in management in a widely held company 
the size of Allstate. Effective upon a change in control, the named executives become subject to covenants 
prohibiting solicitation of employees, customers, and suppliers until one year after termination of employment. If 
a named executive incurs legal fees or other expenses in an effort to enforce the change-in-control plan, Allstate 
will reimburse the named executive for these expenses unless it is established by a court that the named 
executive had no reasonable basis for the claim or acted in bad faith.

(3)  Under the change-in-control plan, severance benefits would be payable if a named executive’s employment is 

terminated either by Allstate without cause or by the executive for good reason as defined in the plan during the 
two years following the change in control. Cause means the named executive has been convicted of a felony or 
other crime involving fraud or dishonesty, has willfully or intentionally breached the restrictive covenants in the 
change-in-control plan, has habitually neglected his or her duties, or has engaged in willful or reckless material 
misconduct in the performance of his or her duties. Good reason includes a material diminution in a named 
executive’s base compensation, authority, duties, or responsibilities, or a material change in the geographic 
location where the named executive performs services.

(4)  Named executives who receive an equity award or an annual cash incentive award after May 19, 2009, are subject 

to a non-solicitation covenant while they are employed and for the one-year period following termination of 
employment. If a named executive violates the non-solicitation covenant, to the extent permitted by applicable 
law, compensation provided to the named executive (including cancellation of outstanding awards or recovery 
of all or a portion of any gain realized upon vesting, settlement, or exercise of an award or recovery of all or 
a portion of any proceeds resulting from any disposition of shares received pursuant to an award) may be 
recovered if the vesting, settlement, or exercise of the award or the receipt of the sale proceeds occurred during 
the 12-month period prior to the violation.

(5)  Retirement for purposes of the Annual Executive Incentive Plan is defined as voluntary termination on or after 

the date the named executive attains age 55 with at least 10 years of service or age 60 with five years of service.

(6)  Named executives who receive an equity award on or after May 21, 2013, that remains subject to a period of 
restriction or other performance or vesting condition are subject to a non-compete provision while they are 
employed and for the one-year period following termination of employment. Named executives who received 
equity awards granted between February 21, 2012, and May 20, 2013, are subject to a non-compete provision 

2018 Proxy Statement  61

Executive Compensation  Potential Payments as a Result of Termination or Change in Control (CIC)

while they are employed and for the two-year period following termination of employment. If a named executive 
violates the non-competition covenant, to the extent permitted by applicable law, any or all of the named 
executive’s outstanding awards that remain subject to a period of restriction or other performance or vesting 
condition as of the date on which the named executive first violated the non-competition provision may 
be canceled.

(7)  Retirement definitions and treatment for purposes of stock options, restricted stock units, and performance 

stock awards are as follows:

Definition
Treatment

Date of award on or after February 21, 2012
Normal Retirement-age 55 with 10 years of service or age 60 with at least five years of service
•  Unvested awards not granted within 12 months of retirement continue to vest. 
•  Prorated portion of unvested awards granted within 12 months of the retirement date 

continue to vest.

•  Vested stock options expire at the earlier of five years from the date of retirement or the 

expiration date of the option.

 

Stock option awards granted in 2012 and before have vested and will expire at the earlier of five years from the 
date of retirement or the expiration date of the option.

(8)  The committee will determine the number of PSAs that continue to vest based on actual performance up to the 

change in control.

(9)  For open cycles, the payout is based on the target number of PSAs.
(10)  See the Retirement Benefits section for further detail on non-qualified pension benefits and timing of payments.
(11)  See the Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation at Fiscal Year-end 2017 section for additional information on the 

Deferred Compensation Plan and distribution options available.

(12)  If a named executive’s employment is terminated due to death during the two years after the date of a change 
in control, the named executive’s estate or beneficiary will be entitled to survivor and other benefits, including 
retiree medical coverage, if eligible, that are not less favorable than the most favorable benefits available to the 
estates or surviving families of peer executives of Allstate. In the event of termination due to disability during 
the two years after the date of a change in control, Allstate will pay disability and other benefits, including 
supplemental long-term disability benefits and retiree medical coverage, if eligible, that are not less favorable 
than the most favorable benefits available to disabled peer executives.

same for both the named executives and all salaried employees.

(2)  The 2017 annual incentive plan payment is payable to all named executives as a result of death and disability. In 
addition, it is payable to Messrs. Wilson, Shebik, and Winter in the event of retirement. The amount listed for the 
annual incentive plan payment upon termination due to a change in control is shown at target as defined in the 
change-in-control severance plan.

(3)  As of December 31, 2017, Messrs. Wilson, Shebik, and Winter are the only named executives eligible to retire in 

accordance with Allstate’s policy and the terms of its equity incentive compensation and benefit plans.

(4)  The values in this change-in-control row represent amounts paid if both the change in control and qualifying 
termination occur on December 31, 2017. PSAs are paid out based on actual performance; for purposes of this 
table, the 2015-2017 cycle is shown at 82.7% of target, 2016-2018, and 2017-2019 cycles are reflected at target. 

2018 Proxy Statement  63

Executive Compensation  Performance Measures for 2017

Beginning with awards granted in 2012, equity awards do not accelerate in the event of a change in control unless 
also accompanied by a qualifying termination of employment. A change in control also would accelerate the 
distribution of each named executive’s non-qualified deferred compensation and SRIP benefits. Please see the 
Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation at Fiscal Year-end 2017 table and footnote 2 to the Pension Benefits table in 
the Retirement Benefits section for details regarding the applicable amounts for each named executive.

(5)  The Welfare Benefits and Outplacement Services amount includes the cost to provide certain welfare benefits 
to the named executive and family during the period the named executive is eligible for continuation coverage 
under applicable law. The amount shown reflects Allstate’s costs for these benefits or programs assuming an 
18-month continuation period. The value of outplacement services is $50,000 for each named executive.

(6)  The named executives who participate in the long-term disability plan are eligible to participate in Allstate’s 

supplemental long-term disability plan for employees whose annual earnings exceed the level which produces 
the maximum monthly benefit provided by the long-term disability plan (basic plan). The monthly benefit is equal 
to 60% of the named executive’s qualified annual earnings divided by twelve and rounded to the nearest $100, 
reduced by $7,500, which is the maximum monthly benefit payment that can be received under the basic plan. 
The amount reflected assumes the named executive remains totally disabled until age 65 and represents the 
present value of the monthly benefit payable until age 65.

Performance Measures for 2017

The following pages contain descriptions of the 
performance measures used for executive incentive 
compensation. They were developed uniquely for 
incentive compensation purposes, are non-GAAP 
measures and are not reported in our financial 
statements. The committee has approved the use 
of non-GAAP measures when appropriate to drive 
executive focus on particular strategic, operational, 
or financial factors, or to exclude factors over which 
our executives have little influence or control. The 
committee monitors compensation estimates during

the year based on actual performance on these 
measures, and the internal audit department reviews 
the final results.

Performance Net Income: This measure is 
calculated uniquely for annual cash incentive awards, 
the 162(m) pool, and each PSA performance cycle. 
For each plan, Performance Net Income is equal to 
net income applicable to common shareholders as 
reported in The Allstate Corporation annual report on 
Form 10-K adjusted for the after-tax effect of the items 
indicated below:

ANNUAL CASH INCENTIVE AWARD PERFORMANCE MEASURES FOR 2017

•   Performance Net Income: This measure is used to 
assess financial performance. In 2017, Performance 
Net Income was $2,703 million compared to reported 
Adjusted Net Income* of $2,467 million, an increase 
of $236 million. It was adjusted to remove the 
impacts of the underwriting loss of the Discontinued 
Lines and Coverages segment, restructuring and 
related charges, a maximum amount of after-tax 
catastrophes and PBLT income, pension settlement 
charge and employee share-based accounting 
tax benefit.

adjusted to include a minimum or maximum amount 
of PBLT income if the actual amounts are less than or 
exceed those amounts, respectively. Net Investment 
Income is also subject to adjustments to be consistent 
with the financial reporting used in establishing the 
measure and to exclude the effects of acquiring and 
selling businesses. In 2017, an adjustment to reflect 
a maximum amount of PBLT income was necessary, 
resulting in Net Investment Income of $3,188 million, 
compared to reported net investment income of 
$3,401 million.

•  Net Investment Income: This measure is used to 

•  Total Premiums: This measure is used to assess 

assess the financial operating performance provided 
from investments. Net Investment Income as reported 
in the consolidated statement of operations is 

growth within the Allstate Protection, Service 
Businesses, Allstate Life, Allstate Benefits, and Allstate 
Annuities businesses. It is equal to the sum of Allstate 

2018 Proxy Statement  65

Executive Compensation  Performance Measures for 2017

Protection and Service Businesses premiums written 
and Allstate Life, Benefits, and Annuities premiums 
and contract charges as described below.

Premiums written is equal to the Allstate Protection 
and Service Businesses net premiums written as 
reported in management’s discussion and analysis in 
The Allstate Corporation annual report on Form 10-K.

Premiums and contract charges are equal to life 
premiums and contract charges reported in the 
consolidated statement of operations in The Allstate 
Corporation annual report on Form 10-K.

Total Premiums is subject to adjustments to be 
consistent with the financial reporting used in 
establishing the measure and to exclude the 
effects of acquiring and selling businesses. No such 
adjustments were necessary in 2017. 

Total Premiums of $35,120 million were equal to 
reported Total Premiums.

•  Total Return: This measure is used to assess financial 

performance of the investment portfolio. Total 
return is calculated as the ratio of the sum of net 
investment income, realized capital gains and losses, 
the change in unrealized net capital gains and losses, 
and the change in the difference between fair value 
and carrying value of mortgage loans, cost method 
limited partnerships, bank loans and agent loans, 
divided by the average fair value balances at the 
beginning and at the end of 2017.

Total Return is subject to adjustment to be consistent 
with the financial reporting used in establishing the 
measure and to exclude the effects of acquiring and 
selling businesses. In 2017, no adjustments were 
necessary, and Total Return was 5.9%.

PERFORMANCE STOCK AWARD PERFORMANCE MEASURES FOR THE 2015-2017 
PERFORMANCE CYCLE

•   Three-Year Average Performance Net Income Return 
on Equity: It is calculated as the ratio of the average 
Performance Net Income for the three years in the 
period divided by the average of Adjusted Common 
Shareholders’ Equity at December 31 of the year-end 
immediately preceding the period and at the end of 
each year in the three-year period.

•  Adjusted Common Shareholders’ Equity is equal 

to common shareholders’ equity excluding the net 
effects of unrealized net capital gains and losses. It 
is subject to adjustments to be consistent with the 
financial reporting used in establishing the measure 
and to exclude the net effects of acquiring and 

selling businesses. Adjusted Common Shareholders’ 
Equity at December 31 of the year-end immediately 
preceding the period is not subject to adjustment.

•  Three-year Average Performance Net Income Return 

on Equity for the 2015-2017 performance cycle was 
12.2%, compared to our reported Adjusted Net Income 
return on equity* of 13.4%, 10.4% and 11.6% for the three 
years ended 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, and the 
three-year average of 11.8%. The primary adjustments 
relate to underwriting loss of the Discontinued Lines 
and Coverages segment, restructuring and related 
charges, net effects of acquiring business, and 
employee share-based accounting tax benefit.

PERFORMANCE STOCK AWARD PERFORMANCE MEASURES FOR THE 2016-2018, 2017-2019 
AND 2018-2020 PERFORMANCE CYCLES

•  Three-Year Average Performance Net Income Return 

on Equity (measure weighted at 70%): These cycles are 
calculated in a similar manner to the 2015-2017 cycle as 
disclosed above, but are adjusted to reflect the foreign 
exchange rate used in establishing the measure (in place 
of actual foreign currency translation) for any period if 
the Total Premiums measure for the Annual Incentive 
Plan is adjusted for foreign exchange rates. For the 2018-
2020 performance cycle, average common shareholders’ 
equity will also be adjusted to remove the impact of 

other significant non-recurring, infrequent or unusual 
items in excess of a threshold and parent holding 
company level deployable assets in excess of $1 billion.

•  Earned Book Value (measure weighted at 30%): 

Earned Book Value is the increase between 
common shareholders’ equity at December 31 of 
the year-end immediately preceding the three-year 
period and adjusted common shareholders’ equity 
at December 31 of the last year of the three-year 
period expressed as a compound annual growth rate.

CEO Pay Ratio  Executive Compensation

•  Be consistent with the financial reporting used in 

establishing the measure.

•  Exclude the effects of acquiring and 

selling businesses.

•  Reflect the foreign exchange rate used in 

establishing the measure (in place of actual foreign 
currency translation) for any period if the Total 
Premiums measure for the Annual Incentive Plan is 
adjusted for foreign exchange rates.

Adjusted common shareholders’ equity is equal to 
common shareholders’ equity at December 31 of the 
last year of the three-year period adjusted to: 

•  Add back reductions for common share repurchases 
and declared common shareholder dividends during 
the three-year period.

•  Remove the impact of other significant non-recurring, 

infrequent or unusual items in excess of a threshold.

•  Reflect a minimum or maximum amount of after-tax 
catastrophe losses if the actual after-tax catastrophe 
losses are more or less than +/- 20% respectively 
of the three years of catastrophe losses used to 
establish the measure.

CEO Pay Ratio

As required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, we are providing information 
about the relationship of the annual total compensation of our employees to the annual total compensation of 
Mr. Wilson, our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”). This pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner 
consistent with the final SEC rules. 

For 2017,

• 

• 

the annual total compensation of our median employee was $81,573; and

the annual total compensation of our CEO, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table in this Proxy 
Statement, was $18,757,329.

•  The ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr. Wilson to our median employee was 230:1. 

As required by SEC rules, the annual total compensation for both the CEO and median employee includes the 
change in pension value during the year. The change in pension value is subject to several external variables, 
including interest rates, that are not related to company or individual performance and may differ significantly based 
on the formula under which the benefits were earned. If we eliminated the change in pension value from our median 
employee and CEO’s total compensation, our CEO to median employee pay ratio would have been 294:1. 

We also note that, in contrast to the compensation of the median employee, a significant portion of our CEO’s 
compensation is tied to company performance. If we were to calculate the ratio using Mr. Wilson’s target annual 
cash incentive (as opposed to the actual cash incentive award paid to him based on 2017 company performance), 
our CEO to median employee pay ratio would have been 193:1.

2018 Proxy Statement  67

Executive Compensation  CEO Pay Ratio

To calculate the ratio, we used the following methodology and material assumptions, adjustments, and estimates:

  We selected October 2, 2017, which is within the last three months of 2017 as permitted by SEC rules, as the 

determination date because it enabled us sufficient time to calculate the ratio. 

  As of October 2, 2017, our U.S. and non-U.S. employee population consisted of 44,432 full-time, part-time, 

seasonal and temporary employees. 

  In determining the employee population to be used to calculate the compensation of the median employee, 
we included employees in all countries except for 2,155 employees in the United Kingdom, who represented 
less than 5% of our total employees, as permitted under the applicable SEC de minimis rule. As a result, the 
employee population that we used for purposes of determining the compensation of our median employee 
was 42,277.

  We excluded our agent population since they are not employees of Allstate or its subsidiaries.

  We selected total cash (base salary plus incentive compensation) as the most appropriate and consistently 

applied compensation measure to determine the median worker since we do not widely distribute 
equity awards.

  We measured compensation for our employees using a nine-month look-back period ending 

September 30, 2017.

  Permanent employees who were hired in 2017, but did not work for the entire period, had their 

compensation adjusted as if they were employed for the entire nine-month period. 

  For employees outside of the United States, we use a year-to-date average of January 1, 2017, through 

September 30, 2017, for each of the exchange rates.

  After identifying the median worker based on total cash compensation, we calculated annual total 

compensation for that person using the same methodology we use for our named executives in the 
Summary Compensation Table in this Proxy Statement.

  As noted above, the median employee’s annual total compensation was $81,573. The median employee was 
a U.S. claims employee with total cash compensation of $56,410, a change in pension value of $23,575, and 
other compensation in the amount of $1,588.  The change in pension value is high in comparison to total 
cash compensation as a result of the median employee earning pension benefits under the final average 
pay formula until December 31, 2013. Approximately 30% of the pension-eligible Allstate employees in the 
U.S., including the CEO, earned pension benefits under the final average pay formula prior to 2014.

The SEC rules for identifying the median of our employees and calculating the pay ratio allow companies to use 
a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions 
that reflect a company’s employee populations and compensation practices. For that reason, the pay ratio 
reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above. Neither the Compensation 
and Succession Committee nor management of the company used the pay ratio measure in making 
compensation decisions.

AUDIT COMMITTEE MATTERS

for 2018

PROPOSAL3 Ratification of Deloitte & Touche LLP as the Independent Registered Public Accountant 

  The Board recommends a vote  FOR  ratification of Deloitte & Touche LLP 
for 2018.

• 
•  Significant industry and financial reporting expertise.
•  The audit committee annually evaluates Deloitte & Touche LLP and determined that 

Independent firm with few ancillary services and reasonable fees.

its retention continues to be in the best interests of Allstate and its stockholders.

The audit committee has established strong practices 
to evaluate the qualifications, compensation, 
performance, and independence of the independent 
registered public accountant both on an ongoing basis 
throughout the year and through the completion of 
an annual evaluation. Additional information regarding 
the audit committee’s duties and responsibilities is 
available in the committee’s charter located under 
the Governance section of Allstate’s investor relations 
website at www.allstateinvestors.com. Deloitte & Touche 
LLP has been Allstate’s independent registered public 
accountant since Allstate became a publicly traded 
entity in 1993.

As a starting point for the annual evaluation, a survey is 
administered by a Deloitte & Touche LLP partner who is 
not affiliated with the Allstate account and by a risk or 
internal audit executive. The survey assesses Allstate’s 
general satisfaction with the quality and efficiency of 
the services provided. Results are reported to the audit 
committee for its discussion and analysis.

In addition, the audit committee reviews and 
discusses the results of the firm’s reports on its quality 
controls and external assessments, including results 
of inspections conducted by the Public Company 
Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB).

Rotation of the independent registered public 
accounting firm is explicitly considered each year by the 
committee in addition to the regular mandated rotation 
of audit partners.

The audit committee has adopted a policy regarding 
its pre-approval of all audit and permissible non-audit 
services provided by the independent registered public 
accountant. The policy identifies the basic principles 
that must be considered by the audit committee in 
approving services to ensure that the registered public 
accountant’s independence is not impaired, describes 
the type of audit, audit-related, tax and other services 
that may be provided, and lists the non-audit services 
that may not be performed. The independent registered 
public accountant or management will submit to the 
audit committee detailed schedules with all of the 
proposed services within each category, together with 
the estimated fees. Each specific service will require 
approval before service can begin.

Prior to requesting approval from the audit committee, 
the registered public accountant and management 
consider and conclude that the services are permissible 
in that they: (1) do not place the registered public 
accountant in the position of auditing their own work, 
(2) do not result in the registered public accountant’s 
personnel acting as management or an employee 
of Allstate, (3) do not place the registered public 
accountant in a position of being an advocate for 
Allstate, (4) do not create a mutual or conflicting interest 
between the registered public accountant and Allstate 
and (5) are not based on a contingent fee arrangement. 
The audit committee’s policy delegates to the chair the 
authority to grant approvals, but the decisions of the 
chair must be reported to the audit committee at its 
next regularly scheduled meeting. All services provided 
by Deloitte & Touche LLP in 2016 and 2017 were 
approved in accordance with this pre-approval policy.

2018 Proxy Statement  69

Audit Committee Matters  Proposal 3

Based on the results of the annual evaluation, the audit committee has appointed Deloitte & Touche LLP 
as Allstate’s independent registered public accountant for 2018. The factors considered by the audit 
committee include:

•  Focus on independence, objectivity, and professional skepticism;

• 

Insurance and technical expertise and capability in handling the breadth and complexity of Allstate’s 
operations and industry;

•  Professionalism and responsiveness;

•  Sharing industry insights, trends, and latest practices;

•  Quality and efficiency of the work performed;

•  Quality of discussions and feedback sessions;

•  External data on audit quality and performance, including the results from the PCAOB; and

•  Reasonableness of fees.

The audit committee and the Board believe it is in the best interests of Allstate and its stockholders to continue 
to retain Deloitte & Touche LLP as Allstate’s independent registered public accountant. The committee and its 
chair approve the selection of Deloitte & Touche LLP’s lead engagement partner.

The audit committee oversees and is ultimately 
responsible for the negotiation of audit fees associated 
with the retention of Deloitte & Touche LLP. The 
following fees have been, or are anticipated to be, billed 

by Deloitte & Touche LLP, the member firms of Deloitte 
Touche Tohmatsu, and their respective affiliates, for 
professional services rendered to Allstate for the fiscal 
years ending December 31, 2016, and December 31, 2017.

Audit Committee Report  Audit Committee Matters

Audit Committee Report

Deloitte & Touche LLP (Deloitte) was Allstate’s 
independent registered public accountant for the year 
ended December 31, 2017.

The audit committee reviewed and discussed with 
management the audited financial statements for the 
fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.

The committee discussed with Deloitte the matters 
required to be discussed by Auditing Standard No. 1301, 
as adopted by the Public Company Accounting 
Oversight Board. The committee received the written 
disclosures and letter from Deloitte that is required 
by applicable requirements of the Public Company 

Accounting Oversight Board regarding Deloitte’s 
communications with the committee concerning 
independence and has discussed with Deloitte 
its independence.

Based on these reviews and discussions and other 
information considered by the committee in its 
judgment, the committee recommended to the Board 
of Directors that the audited financial statements be 
included in Allstate’s annual report on Form 10-K for the 
fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, for filing with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission, and furnished 
to stockholders with this Notice of Annual Meeting and 
Proxy Statement.

STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS

  The Board recommends a vote  AGAINST  this proposal.

PROPOSAL4 Stockholder Proposal on Independent Board Chairman

performance is evaluated annually.

the Board.

•  Allstate’s independent lead director is selected through a robust process, and her 

•  Allstate’s independent lead director provides meaningful independent leadership of 

•  The Board should continue to have flexibility to determine whether to split or combine 

the Chair and CEO roles and not be required to utilize one approach.

•  The Board has split the roles of Chair and CEO in the past.
•  The lead director is just one of many structural safeguards that provide effective 

independent oversight of Allstate.

Mr. Kenneth Steiner, 14 Stoner Ave., 2M, Great Neck, NY 11021, beneficial owner of no less than 300 shares of Allstate 
common stock as of December 5, 2017, intends to propose the following resolution at the annual meeting.
Shareholders request our Board of Directors to adopt as policy, and amend our governing documents 
as necessary, to require henceforth that the Chair of the Board of Directors, whenever possible, to be an 
independent member of the Board. The Board would have the discretion to phase in this policy for the next CEO 
transition, implemented so it does not violate any existing agreement.
If the Board determines that a Chair who was independent when selected is no longer independent, the Board 
shall select a new Chair who satisfies the requirements of the policy within a reasonable amount of time. 
Compliance with this policy is waived if no independent director is available and willing to serve as Chairman. This 
proposal requests that all the necessary steps be taken to accomplish the above.
Caterpillar is an example of a company recently changing course and naming an independent board chairman. 
Caterpillar had strongly opposed a shareholder proposal for an independent board chairman as recently as its 
2016 annual meeting. Wells Fargo also changed course and named an independent board chairman in 2016.
It was reported that 53% of the Standard & Poors 1,500 firms separate these 2 positions (2015 report): Chairman 
and CEO. This proposal topic won 50%-plus support at 5 major U.S. companies in 2013 including 73%-support 
at Netflix.
This proposal topic also won impressive 47%-support at our 2016 annual meeting. This 47%-support would have 
been higher (perhaps 51%) if small shareholders had the same access to corporate governance information as 
large shareholders.
Extra consideration could be given to this proposal since our Lead Director, Judith Sprieser lacked an important 
attribute. Ms. Sprieser had 18-years long tenure. Long-tenure can impair the independence of a director — no 
matter how well qualified. Independence is a highly valuable attribute in a director —especially in a Lead Director 
who has additional responsibilities in the oversight of our CEO.
An independent chairman would have the time to improve the qualifications and commitment of our directors. 
For instance the following 4 directors had almost zero "skin in the game" since they owned zero stock or almost 
zero stock:
Judith Sprieser  
Jacques Perold  
Michael Eskew  
Siddharth Mehta
This is compounded by the fact that Allstate pays these directors $250,000 each for perhaps 250 hours of work 
in a year. This is further compounded by the fact that Ms. Sprieser had collected Allstate director pay for 18-years. 
In its response to this proposal management can let us know the total director pay that Allstate has given to 
Ms. Sprieser in 18-years.
Plus these 4 directors controlled 5 positions on our most important board committees and Ms. Sprieser was our 
Lead Director. Serious consideration should be given to whether a director who owns zero stock can serve on an 
important board committee or as a Lead Director.
Please vote to enhance the oversight of our CEO:

Board of Directors’ Statement in Opposition to the Stockholder 
Proposal on Independent Board Chairman

The Board recommends that stockholders vote  AGAINST  this proposal for the following reasons:

ALLSTATE’S INDEPENDENT LEAD DIRECTOR PROVIDES MEANINGFUL INDEPENDENT 
LEADERSHIP OF THE BOARD.

•  The powers of the lead director and committee 

•  Facilitates the evaluation of Board and 

chairs were formalized and expanded in 2016 as a 
result of stockholder dialogue. For a more detailed 
description of our lead director role, see page 19.

•  Our lead director is selected after a comprehensive 

annual process and has well-defined and 
substantive responsibilities:

• 

Is elected solely by independent members of 
the Board;

•  Has authority to call meetings of the independent 

members of the Board;

•  Approves Board meeting agendas, schedules and 

information provided to the Board;

•  Facilitates and communicates the Board’s 

performance evaluation of the CEO and Chair;

director performance;

•  Ensures implementation of the Board committee 
self-evaluation process and reports to the Board, 
and provides guidance to Committee chairs, 
as needed;

•  Facilitates the Chair and CEO succession process;

•  Presides at all Board meetings at which the Chair 

is not present and at all executive sessions; and

•  Communicates with significant stockholders 
and other stakeholders on matters involving 
broad corporate policies and practices, 
when appropriate.

ALLSTATE’S INDEPENDENT LEAD DIRECTOR IS SELECTED THROUGH A ROBUST PROCESS, 
AND HER PERFORMANCE IS EVALUATED ANNUALLY.

•  Each year, the nominating and governance 

committee recommends a director to the 
independent members of the Board to serve as 
the independent lead director. The lead director is 
elected annually by the independent directors but is 
generally expected to serve for more than one year.

•  The lead director’s performance is assessed 

annually; as part of that review, the nominating and 
governance committee evaluates the criteria for 
nominees for the lead director role and assesses any 
needed changes. In selecting the lead director, the 
independent directors consider market, operational, 
and governance issues facing Allstate. They consider 
relevant leadership, operational and corporate 

governance experience, relationships with the 
other Board members and external commitments. 
In addition, the lead director is expected to have a 
thorough understanding of the company’s business 
operations and history.

•  Contrary to what the proponent states, each of 
Allstate’s directors has “skin in the game.” The 
restricted stock units held by each director at the 
end of 2017 are listed on page 29. As shown on 
that table, each of our directors has a substantial 
economic interest valued between $118,000 and 
$4,400,000 based on the closing price of Allstate’s 
common stock of $104.71 on December 29, 2017.

Stockholder Proposals  Board of Directors’ Statement in Opposition to the Stockholder Proposal

THE BOARD SHOULD CONTINUE TO HAVE FLEXIBILITY TO DETERMINE WHETHER TO 
SPLIT OR COMBINE THE CHAIR AND CEO ROLES AND NOT BE REQUIRED TO UTILIZE 
ONE APPROACH.

•  The Board believes it is important to maintain the 

•  At present, the independent directors have 

flexibility to choose whether to split the Board Chair 
and CEO roles at Allstate. Requiring a split of the 
roles would reduce the Board’s ability to act in the 
best interests of the Company as the needs of the 
Board and the Company change over time.

•  According to a survey by a major corporate 

governance firm in 2017, only 12% of the S&P 100 
companies REQUIRE the separation of the roles. 
Most boards believe it is beneficial to have flexibility 
in determining whether to split or combine the roles.

determined Allstate is well-served by having both 
Chair and CEO roles performed by Mr. Wilson, who 
provides excellent leadership and direction for both 
management and the Board. Given his extensive 
Company knowledge and his ability to effectively 
fulfill both roles simultaneously, he is uniquely 
qualified to lead discussions of the Board and is in 
the best position to facilitate the flow of business 
information and communications.

THE BOARD HAS SPLIT THE ROLES OF CHAIR AND CEO IN THE PAST.

•  Allstate’s Board previously and effectively used 
the flexibility to separate the role of Chair and 
CEO. The Board split the roles of Chair and CEO in 
2007 during a leadership transition. When Thomas 
Wilson replaced Edward Liddy as CEO, the Board 
determined that Mr. Liddy should remain Chair. 
Mr. Liddy retired in 2008 and the Board decided to 
elect Mr. Wilson to serve as Chair while retaining his 
role as CEO.

•  The practice of splitting the roles during leadership 

transitions so that a company’s former CEO can 
continue to provide perspective to a new CEO is 
common among companies. According to a study 
by a leading global advisory firm, published in 
January 2017, 37% of stand-alone board chairs of 
Fortune 500 companies previously served as CEO of 
the same company.

THE LEAD DIRECTOR IS JUST ONE OF MANY STRUCTURAL SAFEGUARDS THAT PROVIDE 
EFFECTIVE INDEPENDENT OVERSIGHT OF ALLSTATE.

• 

In addition to the strong role of our independent 
lead director, the Board has policies and practices 
that support a balanced and strong governance 
system, including:

•  All of Allstate’s Board members are independent 

within the meaning of applicable laws, with the 
exception of the CEO; 

•  All members of each of the key Board committees 

(the audit, compensation and succession, 
nominating and governance, and risk and return 
committees) are independent; and

•  The committee chairs’ responsibilities 

were proactively enhanced to include the 
power to approve committee agendas and 
meeting materials.

•  Each committee operates under a written charter 

that has been approved by the Board and that 
details the oversight of key matters, such as the 
integrity of Allstate’s financial statements, executive 
compensation, CEO performance, nomination of 
directors, evaluation of the Board, and risk and 
return management;

•  The Board performs a formal annual evaluation of the 

Chair and CEO in an executive session; and

•  All key Board committees have access to and utilize 

independent external advisors.

Proposal 5  Stockholder Proposals

  The Board recommends a vote  AGAINST  this proposal.

PROPOSAL5 Stockholder Proposal on Reporting Political Contributions

public policy involvement.

•  Allstate already provides stockholders with comprehensive disclosures on Allstate’s 

involvement in the public policy arena (found at www.allstatesustainability.com).

•  Allstate’s Board has strong governance and oversight practices over the Company’s 

•  Allstate surpasses all disclosure requirements pertaining to political contributions under 

federal, state, and local laws.

The International Brotherhood of Teamsters, 25 Louisiana Avenue, NW, Washington, D.C. 20001, beneficial owners 
of no less than 64 shares of Allstate common stock as of December 11, 2017, intends to propose the following 
resolution at the annual meeting.

Resolved, that the shareholders of Allstate Corporation (“Allstate” or “Company”) hereby request that the 
Company provide a report, updated semiannually, disclosing the Company’s:

1.  Policies and procedures for making, with corporate funds or assets, contributions and expenditures (direct or 

indirect) to (a) participate or intervene in any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate 
for public office, or (b) influence the general public, or any segment thereof, with respect to an election 
or referendum.

2.  Monetary and non-monetary contributions and expenditures (direct and indirect) used in the manner 

described in section 1 above, including:

a.  The identity of the recipient as well as the amount paid to each; and
b.  The title(s) of the person(s) in the Company responsible for decision making.

The report shall be presented to the board of directors or relevant board committee and posted on the 
Company’s website within 12 months from the date of the annual meeting. This proposal does not encompass 
lobbying spending.

Supporting Statement: As long-term shareholders of Allstate, we support transparency and accountability in 
corporate political spending. This includes any activity considered intervention in a political campaign under the 
Internal Revenue Code, such as direct and indirect contributions to political candidates, parties, or organizations, 
and independent expenditures or electioneering communications on behalf of federal, state, or local candidates.

Disclosure is in the best interest of the company and its shareholders. The Supreme Court recognized this in 
Citizens United: “[D]isclosure permits citizens and shareholders to react to the speech of corporate entities in 
a proper way. This transparency enables the electorate to make informed decisions and give proper weight to 
different speakers and messages.” 

Publicly available records show Allstate has contributed at least $4.4 million in corporate funds to state and local 
parties and candidates, and 527 political committees, since 2010. (CQ: moneyline.cq.com and National Institute 
on Money in State Politics: www.followthemoney.org)

However, relying on publicly available data does not provide a complete picture of the Company’s political 
spending. For example, indirect contributions through trade associations are not publicly available. And while 
the Company discloses its aggregate payments to political entities and trade associations, it provides little detail 
about which candidates and entities are receiving company money. This proposal asks the Company to disclose 
all of its political spending, including payments to trade associations and other tax-exempt organizations, which 
may be used for political purposes. This would bring our Company in line with a growing number of leading 
companies, including Unum Group, AIG, and Capital One, which present this information on their websites. The 
Company’s board and shareholders need comprehensive disclosure to fully evaluate the political use of corporate 
assets. We urge your support for this critical governance reform.

Stockholder Proposals  Board of Directors’ Statement in Opposition to the Stockholder Proposal

Board of Directors’ Statement in Opposition to the Stockholder 
Proposal on Reporting Political Contributions

The Board recommends that stockholders vote  AGAINST  this proposal for the following reasons:

ALLSTATE ALREADY PROVIDES STOCKHOLDERS WITH COMPREHENSIVE 
DISCLOSURES ON ALLSTATE’S INVOLVEMENT IN THE PUBLIC POLICY ARENA 
(FOUND AT WWW.ALLSTATESUSTAINABILITY.COM).

•  Allstate issues an annual Corporate Involvement in 

Public Policy report, which provides a comprehensive 
discussion of Allstate’s activities. The report 
describes the Board’s process for overseeing 
expenditures, the strategic and business rationale for 
expenditures, total amounts contributed by category 
(including non-deductible amounts for certain 
lobbying activities and to political candidates and 

organizations), those involved in the decision-making 
process, and the major organizations supported.

•  The proponent seeks additional disclosure of line-
item expenditures to each recipient, which is not 
necessary or relevant to the governance of Allstate. 

• 

Investors have indicated strong support for Allstate’s 
current political contribution disclosures.

ALLSTATE’S BOARD HAS STRONG GOVERNANCE AND OVERSIGHT PRACTICES OVER THE 
COMPANY’S PUBLIC POLICY INVOLVEMENT.

•  The specific deployment of corporate resources 

•  We expanded the discussion of Allstate’s oversight 

in the public policy arena is presented formally to 
the Board each year. Our Corporate Governance 
Guidelines address the Board’s annual review and 
our involvement in the public policy arena and can be 
found at www.allstateinvestors.com.

over political spending in the 2016 report and 
accelerated its availability to stockholders prior to 
the 2017 annual meeting. Subject matter experts 
within Allstate make recommendations with 
respect to which organizations and candidates 
to support financially, and members of Allstate’s 
government and industry relations group consult 
with members of senior management to make the 
ultimate determinations.

ALLSTATE SURPASSES ALL DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS PERTAINING TO POLITICAL 
CONTRIBUTIONS UNDER FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL LAWS.

•  Allstate complies with all public disclosure laws at 

the federal, state, and local levels.

•  Allstate maintains internal guidelines and procedures 

to ensure that the Company’s public policy efforts 
remain consistent with its strategy and the long-term 
interests of our stockholders, employees, agencies, 
and customers. For example, we use our industry 

expertise in formulating public policy solutions that 
help mitigate weather-related risks and reduce the 
likelihood and severity of property loss for customers.

•  The proposal would impose requirements on Allstate 

that are not dictated by law and are not standard 
among other companies.

and directors complied with all Section 16(a) filing 
requirements applicable to them during 2017.

2018 Proxy Statement  79

OTHER INFORMATION

Proxy and Voting Information

Who is asking for my vote and why?

The Allstate Board of Directors is soliciting proxies for 
use at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held on 
May 11, 2018, and any adjournments or postponements 
of the meeting. The annual meeting will be held only 
if there is a quorum, which means that a majority of 
the outstanding common stock entitled to vote is 
represented at the meeting by proxy or in person. To 
ensure there will be a quorum, the Allstate Board asks 
you to vote before the meeting, which allows your 
Allstate stock to be represented at the annual meeting.

Who can vote at the annual meeting?

The Allstate Board has set the close of business on 
March 13, 2018, as the record date for the meeting. 
This means that you are entitled to vote if you were 
a stockholder of record at the close of business on 
March 13, 2018. On that date, there were 353,139,462 
shares of Allstate common stock outstanding and 
entitled to vote at the annual meeting.

Why did I receive a notice of Internet 
availability of proxy materials instead of the 
proxy materials?

We distribute our proxy materials to certain stockholders 
over the Internet using “Notice and Access” delivery, as 
permitted by the rules of the Securities and Exchange 
Commission. We elected to use this method for 
certain stockholders as it reduces our print and mail 
costs and the environmental impact of our annual 
stockholders’ meeting.

How do I vote?

Instructions on how to vote your shares are included 
on the Notice on page 4. If you hold shares in your own 
name as a registered stockholder, you may vote in 
person by attending the annual meeting, or you may 
instruct the proxies how to vote your shares by following 
the instructions on the proxy card/voting instruction 
form. If you plan to attend the meeting in person, 
please see the details on pages 81-82. 

80 

  www.allstate.com

If you hold shares in street name (that is, through a 
broker, bank, or other record holder), you should follow 
the instructions provided by your broker, bank, or other 
record holder to vote your shares. 

If you hold shares through the Allstate 401(k) Savings 
Plan, please see the instructions on page 82.

Can I change my vote?

Before your shares have been voted at the annual 
meeting by the proxies, you may change or revoke 
your voting instructions by providing instructions 
again by telephone, by Internet, in writing, or, if you 
are a registered stockholder, by voting in person at the 
annual meeting.

Are the votes kept confidential?

All proxies, ballots, and tabulations that identify the vote 
of a particular stockholder are confidential, except as 
necessary to allow the inspector of election to certify 
the voting results or to meet certain legal requirements. 
A representative of American Election Services, LLC will 
act as the inspector of election and will count the votes. 
The representative is independent of Allstate and its 
directors, officers, and employees.

If you write a comment on your proxy card, voting 
instruction form, or ballot, it may be provided to our 
Secretary along with your name and address.

Your comments will be provided without reference to 
how you voted, unless the vote is mentioned in your 
comment or unless disclosure of the vote is necessary 
to understand your comment. At our request, the 
distribution agent or the solicitation agent will provide 
us with periodic status reports on the aggregate vote. 
These status reports may include a list of stockholders 
who have not voted and breakdowns of vote totals by 
different types of stockholders, as long as we are not 
able to determine how a particular stockholder voted.

Proxy and Voting Information  Other Information

What happens if I submit a signed proxy 
card but do not indicate how I want to vote?

What is “householding” and how does it 
affect me? 

You may instruct the proxies to vote “FOR” or “AGAINST” 
on each proposal, or you may instruct the proxies to 
“ABSTAIN” from voting. If you submit a signed proxy 
card/voting instruction form to allow your shares to be 
represented at the annual meeting but do not indicate 
how your shares should be voted on one or more 
proposals, then the proxies will vote your shares as the 
Board of Directors recommends on those proposals. 
Other than the proposals listed on pages 5-8, we do 
not know of any other matters to be presented at the 
meeting. If any other matters are properly presented 
at the meeting, the proxies may vote your shares in 
accordance with their best judgment.

What vote is needed to approve each item?

Shares of common stock represented by a properly 
completed proxy card/voting instruction form will 
be counted as present at the meeting for purposes 
of determining a quorum, even if the stockholder is 
abstaining from voting.

Proposal 1. To be elected under Allstate’s majority vote 
standard, each director must receive an affirmative vote 
of the majority of the votes cast. In other words, the 
number of shares voted “For” a director must exceed 
50% of the votes cast on that director. Abstentions will 
not be counted as votes cast and will have no impact on 
the vote’s outcome. 

Proposals 2 – 5. A majority of the shares present in 
person or represented by proxy at the meeting and 
entitled to vote must be voted “For” the proposal. 
Abstentions will have the effect of a vote against 
the proposal. 

Are broker non-votes counted at the meeting?

Brokers and banks have discretionary authority to vote 
shares in the absence of instructions on matters the 
New York Stock Exchange considers “routine,” such 
as the ratification of the appointment of the auditors. 
They do not have discretionary authority to vote 
shares in the absence of instructions on “non-routine” 
matters, such as the election of directors, say-on-pay, 
or the stockholder proposals. Broker non-votes will 
not be counted as shares entitled to vote on any of 
the foregoing matters and will have no impact on the 
vote’s outcome.

Allstate has adopted the “householding” procedure 
approved by the SEC, which allows us to deliver one 
set of documents to a household of stockholders 
instead of delivering a set to each stockholder in a 
household, unless we have been instructed otherwise. 
This procedure is more environmentally friendly and 
cost-effective because it reduces the number of copies 
to be printed and mailed. Stockholders who receive 
proxy materials in paper form will continue to receive 
separate proxy cards/voting instruction forms to vote 
their shares. Stockholders who receive the Notice 
of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials will receive 
instructions on submitting their proxy cards/voting 
instruction form via the Internet.

If you would like to change your householding election, 
request that a single copy of the proxy materials be 
sent to your address, or request a separate copy of the 
proxy materials, please contact our distribution agent, 
Broadridge Financial Solutions, by calling (866) 540-7095 
or by writing to Broadridge Householding Department, 
51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, NY 11717. We will promptly 
deliver the proxy materials to you upon receipt of your 
request. If you hold your shares in street name, please 
contact your bank, broker, or other record holder to 
request information about householding. 

If you receive more than one proxy card/voting 
instruction form, your shares probably are registered in 
more than one account or you may hold shares both as 
a registered stockholder and through the Allstate 401(k) 
Savings Plan. You should vote each proxy card/voting 
instruction form you receive.

How do I attend the annual meeting?

If you plan to attend the meeting, you must be a holder 
of Allstate shares as of the record date of March 13, 
2018. We encourage you to request an admission 
ticket in advance. You may request admission tickets 
by visiting www.proxyvote.com and following the 
instructions provided or calling 1-888-247-6053. You 
will need your proxy card, voting instruction form, or 
notice of Internet availability with you when you request 
the ticket.

At the entrance to the meeting, we will request to see 
your admission ticket and valid photo identification,

Other Information  Proxy and Voting Information

If you do not request an admission ticket in advance, 
we will request to see your photo identification at the 
entrance to the meeting. We will then confirm your 
common stock ownership on the record date by:

•  For registered stockholders: verifying your 

name and stock ownership against our list of 
registered stockholders.

•  For beneficial or street name stockholders (those 

holding shares through a broker, bank or other 
record holder): asking to review evidence of your 
stock ownership as of March 13, 2018, such as your 
brokerage statement. You must bring such evidence 
with you in order to be admitted to the meeting.

If you are acting as a proxy, we will need to review a valid 
written legal proxy signed by the owner of the common 
stock granting you the required authority to vote the 
owner’s shares.

Where can I find the results of the 
annual meeting?

Preliminary results will be announced at the meeting 
and final results will be reported in a current report on 
Form 8-K, which is expected to be filed with the SEC 
within four business days after the meeting.

Who will pay the cost of this 
proxy solicitation?

Allstate pays the cost of this proxy solicitation. Officers 
and other employees of Allstate and its subsidiaries may 
solicit proxies by mail, personal interview, telephone, 
facsimile, electronic means, or via the Internet. None 
of these individuals will receive special compensation 
for soliciting votes, which will be performed in 
addition to their regular duties, and some of them 
may not necessarily solicit proxies. Allstate also has 
made arrangements with brokerage firms, banks, 
record holders, and other fiduciaries to forward proxy 
solicitation materials to the beneficial owners of shares 
they hold on your behalf. Allstate will reimburse these 
intermediaries for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. 
Georgeson LLC, 1290 Avenue of the Americas, 9th Floor, 
New York, NY 10104 has been retained to assist in the 
solicitation of proxies for a fee of $16,500 plus expenses.

How do I vote if I hold shares through the 
401(k) Savings Plan?

If you hold Allstate common shares through the Allstate 
401(k) Savings Plan, your proxy card/voting instruction 
form for those shares will instruct the plan trustee 
how to vote those shares. If you received your annual 

82 

  www.allstate.com

meeting materials electronically, and you hold Allstate 
common shares both through the plan and also directly 
as a registered stockholder, the voting instructions you 
provide electronically will be applied to both your plan 
shares and your registered shares. If you return a signed 
proxy card/voting instruction form or vote by telephone 
or the Internet on a timely basis, the trustee will follow 
your voting instructions for all Allstate common shares 
allocated to your plan account unless that would be 
inconsistent with the trustee’s duties.

If your voting instructions are not received on a timely 
basis, the shares allocated to your plan account will 
be considered “unvoted.” If you return a signed proxy 
card/ voting instruction form but do not indicate 
how your shares should be voted on a given matter, 
the shares represented by your proxy card/voting 
instruction form will be voted as the Board of Directors 
recommends. The trustee will vote all unvoted shares 
and all unallocated shares held by the plan as follows:

• 

• 

If the trustee receives instructions (through voting 
instruction forms or through telephonic or Internet 
instruction) on a timely basis for at least 50% of 
the votable allocated shares in the plan, then it will 
vote all unvoted shares and unallocated shares in 
the same proportion and in the same manner as 
the shares for which timely instructions have been 
received, unless to do so would be inconsistent with 
the trustee’s duties. 

If the trustee receives instructions for less than 
50% of the votable allocated shares, the trustee 
will vote all unvoted and unallocated shares in its 
sole discretion. However, the trustee will not use its 
discretionary authority to vote on adjournment of the 
meeting in order to solicit further proxies.

Plan votes receive the same high level of 
confidentiality as all other votes. You may not vote 
the shares allocated to your plan account by voting in 
person at the meeting. You must instruct The Northern 
Trust Company, as trustee for the plan, how to vote 
your shares.

By order of the Board,

Appendix A – Definitions of Non-GAAP Measures  Other Information

Appendix A – Definitions of Non-GAAP Measures

Measures that are not based on accounting principles 
generally accepted in the United States of America 
(“non-GAAP”) are defined and reconciled to the most 
directly comparable GAAP measure. We believe that 
investors’ understanding of Allstate’s performance is 
enhanced by our disclosure of the following non-GAAP 
measures. Our methods for calculating these measures 
may differ from those used by other companies and 
therefore comparability may be limited. 

Adjusted Net Income (previously called “operating 
income”) is net income applicable to common 
shareholders, excluding: 

• 

realized capital gains and losses, after-tax, except 
for periodic settlements and accruals on non-hedge 
derivative instruments, which are reported with 
realized capital gains and losses but included in 
Adjusted Net Income, 

•  valuation changes on embedded derivatives not 

hedged, after-tax,

•  amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 

(“DAC”) and deferred sales inducements (“DSI”), to 
the extent they resulted from the recognition of 
certain realized capital gains and losses or valuation 
changes on embedded derivatives not hedged, 
after-tax, 

•  business combination expenses and the amortization 

of purchased intangible assets, after-tax, 

•  gain (loss) on disposition of operations, after-tax, and 

•  adjustments for other significant non-recurring, 
infrequent or unusual items, when (a) the nature 
of the charge or gain is such that it is reasonably 
unlikely to recur within two years, or (b) there has 
been no similar charge or gain within the prior 
two years. 

Net income applicable to common shareholders is the 
GAAP measure that is most directly comparable to 
Adjusted Net Income. 

We use Adjusted Net Income as an important measure 
to evaluate our results of operations. We believe that 
the measure provides investors with a valuable measure 
of the company’s ongoing performance because it 
reveals trends in our insurance and financial services 
business that may be obscured by the net effect of 
realized capital gains and losses, valuation changes 
on embedded derivatives not hedged, business 
combination expenses and the amortization of 
purchased intangible assets, gain (loss) on disposition 
of operations and adjustments for other significant 
non-recurring, infrequent or unusual items. 

Realized capital gains and losses, valuation changes on 
embedded derivatives not hedged and gain (loss) on 
disposition of operations may vary significantly between 
periods and are generally driven by business decisions 
and external economic developments such as capital 
market conditions, the timing of which is unrelated to 
the insurance underwriting process. Consistent with 
our intent to protect results or earn additional income, 
Adjusted Net Income includes periodic settlements 
and accruals on certain derivative instruments that are 
reported in realized capital gains and losses because 
they do not qualify for hedge accounting or are not 
designated as hedges for accounting purposes. These 
instruments are used for economic hedges and to 
replicate fixed income securities, and by including 
them in Adjusted Net Income, we are appropriately 
reflecting their trends in our performance and in a 
manner consistent with the economically hedged 
investments, product attributes (e.g. net investment 
income and interest credited to contractholder funds) or 
replicated investments. 

Business combination expenses are excluded because 
they are non-recurring in nature and the amortization 
of purchased intangible assets is excluded because 
it relates to the acquisition purchase price and is not 
indicative of our underlying insurance business results 
or trends.

Non-recurring items are excluded because, by their 
nature, they are not indicative of our business or 
economic trends.

Accordingly, Adjusted Net Income excludes the effect 
of items that tend to be highly variable from period 
to period and highlights the results from ongoing 
operations and the underlying profitability of our 
business. A byproduct of excluding these items to 
determine Adjusted Net Income is the transparency 
and understanding of their significance to net income 
variability and profitability while recognizing these or 
similar items may recur in subsequent periods. 

Adjusted Net Income is used by management along 
with the other components of net income applicable 
to common shareholders to assess our performance. 
We use adjusted measures of Adjusted Net Income 
in incentive compensation. Therefore, we believe it is 
useful for investors to evaluate net income applicable to 
common shareholders, Adjusted Net Income and their 
components separately and in the aggregate when 
reviewing and evaluating our performance. 

We note that investors, financial analysts, financial 
and business media organizations and rating agencies 
utilize Adjusted Net Income results in their evaluation 

2018 Proxy Statement  83

Other Information  Appendix A – Definitions of Non-GAAP Measures

of our and our industry’s financial performance and 
in their investment decisions, recommendations 
and communications as it represents a reliable, 
representative and consistent measurement of 
the industry and the company and management’s 
performance. We note that the price to earnings 
multiple commonly used by insurance investors as a 
forward-looking valuation technique uses Adjusted 
Net Income as the denominator. Adjusted Net Income 
should not be considered a substitute for net income 
applicable to common shareholders and does not reflect 
the overall profitability of our business. 

The following table reconciles consolidated net income 
applicable to common shareholders and Adjusted 
Net Income for the years ended December 31. Taxes 
on adjustments to reconcile net income applicable 
to common shareholders and Adjusted Net Income 
generally use a 35% effective tax rate and are reported 
net of income taxes as the reconciling adjustment, 
except for goodwill impairment that has no income tax 
benefit and the Tax Legislation benefit and change 
in accounting for investments in qualified affordable 
housing projects that are adjustments directly related 
to tax.

Combined ratio excluding the effect of catastrophes, 
prior year reserve reestimates and amortization of 
purchased intangible assets (“underlying combined 
ratio”) is a non-GAAP ratio, which is computed as 
the difference between four GAAP operating ratios: 
the combined ratio, the effect of catastrophes on the 
combined ratio, the effect of prior year non-catastrophe 

reserve reestimates on the combined ratio, and the 
effect of amortization of purchased intangible assets 
on the combined ratio. We believe that this ratio is 
useful to investors and it is used by management to 
reveal the trends in our Property-Liability business that 
may be obscured by catastrophe losses, prior year 
reserve reestimates and amortization of purchased

intangible assets. Catastrophe losses cause our loss 
trends to vary significantly between periods as a 
result of their incidence of occurrence and magnitude, 
and can have a significant impact on the combined 
ratio. Prior year reserve reestimates are caused by 
unexpected loss development on historical reserves, 
which could increase or decrease current year Net 
Income. Amortization of purchased intangible assets 
relates to the acquisition purchase price and is not 
indicative of our underlying insurance business results 
or trends. We believe it is useful for investors to evaluate 

these components separately and in the aggregate 
when reviewing our underwriting performance. We 
also provide it to facilitate a comparison to our outlook 
on the underlying combined ratio. The most directly 
comparable GAAP measure is the combined ratio. The 
underlying combined ratio should not be considered a 
substitute for the combined ratio and does not reflect 
the overall underwriting profitability of our business. 

The following table reconciles the Property-Liability 
combined ratio to the Property-Liability underlying 
combined ratio for the years ended December 31.

2017 to 2015. Property-Liability results also include the Service Businesses segment results for 2014 and 2013.

Underwriting margin is calculated as 100% minus the 
combined ratio.

Adjusted Net Income return on common 
shareholders’ equity is a ratio that uses a non-GAAP 
measure. It is calculated by dividing the rolling 12-month 
Adjusted Net Income by the average of common 
shareholders’ equity at the beginning and at the end of 
the 12 months, after excluding the effect of unrealized 
net capital gains and losses. Return on common 
shareholders’ equity is the most directly comparable 
GAAP measure. We use Adjusted Net Income as the 
numerator for the same reasons we use Adjusted Net 
Income, as discussed above. We use average common 
shareholders’ equity excluding the effect of unrealized 
net capital gains and losses for the denominator as a 
representation of common shareholders’ equity primarily 
attributable to the company’s earned and realized 
business operations because it eliminates the effect of 
items that are unrealized and vary significantly between 
periods due to external economic developments such 
as capital market conditions like changes in equity 
prices and interest rates, the amount and timing of 
which are unrelated to the insurance underwriting 
process. We use it to supplement our evaluation of net 
income applicable to common shareholders and return 
on common shareholders’ equity because it excludes 
the effect of items that tend to be highly variable 
from period to period. We believe that this measure is 
useful to investors and that it provides a valuable tool 
for investors when considered along with return on 

common shareholders’ equity because it eliminates 
the after-tax effects of realized and unrealized net 
capital gains and losses that can fluctuate significantly 
from period to period and that are driven by economic 
developments, the magnitude and timing of which are 
generally not influenced by management. In addition, it 
eliminates non-recurring items that are not indicative of 
our ongoing business or economic trends. A byproduct 
of excluding the items noted above to determine 
Adjusted Net Income return on common shareholders’ 
equity from return on common shareholders’ equity is 
the transparency and understanding of their significance 
to return on common shareholders’ equity variability 
and profitability while recognizing these or similar items 
may recur in subsequent periods. We use adjusted 
measures of Adjusted Net Income return on common 
shareholders’ equity in incentive compensation. 
Therefore, we believe it is useful for investors to have 
Adjusted Net Income return on common shareholders’ 
equity and return on common shareholders’ equity 
when evaluating our performance. We note that 
investors, financial analysts, financial and business 
media organizations and rating agencies utilize Adjusted 
Net Income return on common shareholders’ equity 
results in their evaluation of our and our industry’s 
financial performance and in their investment decisions, 
recommendations and communications as it represents 
a reliable, representative and consistent measurement 
of the industry and the company and management’s 
utilization of capital. Adjusted Net Income return on

The Allstate Corporation was incorporated under 

the laws of the State of Delaware on November 5, 1992 
to serve as the holding company for Allstate Insurance 
Company.  Its business is conducted principally 
through Allstate Insurance Company, Allstate Life 
Insurance Company and other subsidiaries (collectively, 
including The Allstate Corporation, “Allstate”).  Allstate 
is primarily engaged in the property and casualty 
insurance business and the sale of life and accident 
and health insurance products in the United States and 
Canada. 

The Allstate Corporation is the largest publicly held 

personal lines insurer in the United States.  Allstate’s 
strategy is to serve distinct customer segments with 
differentiated offerings.  The Allstate brand is widely 
known through the “You’re In Good Hands With 
Allstate®” slogan.  Allstate is the 2nd largest personal 
property and casualty insurer in the United States on 
the basis of 2016 statutory direct premiums written 
according to A.M. Best.  

In addition, according to A.M. Best, Allstate is the 
nation’s 19th largest issuer of life insurance business on 
Segment Information 

the basis of 2016 ordinary life insurance in force and 
36th largest on the basis of 2016 statutory admitted 
assets.  In this annual report on Form 10-K, we 
occasionally refer to statutory financial information.  All 
domestic United States insurance companies are 
required to prepare statutory-basis financial 
statements.  As a result, industry data is available that 
enables comparisons between insurance companies, 
including competitors that are not required to prepare 
financial statements in conformity with accounting 
principles generally accepted in the United States of 
America (“GAAP”).  We frequently use industry 
publications containing statutory financial information 
to assess our competitive position.

To achieve its goals in 2018, Allstate is focused on 

the following priorities:

•  Better serve our customers
•  Achieve target economic returns on capital
•  Grow customer base
•  Proactively manage investments
•  Build long-term growth platforms

We evaluate performance and make resource and capital decisions across seven reportable segments.

Segment Information  Business  

Allstate Protection Segment

Our Allstate Protection segment accounted for 91% of Allstate’s 2017 consolidated insurance premiums and 

contract charges.  In this segment, we principally offer consumer private passenger auto, homeowners, and other 
personal lines insurance products through agencies and directly through contact centers and the internet.  Our 
strategy is to position our product offerings and distribution channels to meet customers’ evolving needs and 
effectively address the risks they face. 

Allstate Protection has four market-facing businesses with products and services that cater to different customer 

preferences for advice and brand recognition to improve our competitive position and performance.

Strategy 

We serve all four consumer segments with unique 
products and value propositions, while leveraging our 
claims, pricing and operational capabilities. 

Allstate brand strategy  

Our strategy is to grow by positioning Allstate 

exclusive agencies as trusted advisors to customers 
and leveraging best-in-class operational capabilities.  
Our target customers prefer to purchase multiple 
products from one insurance provider, including auto, 
homeowners, life insurance and financial products.  The 
Allstate brand differentiates itself by offering 
comprehensive product options and features through 
agencies that provide local advice and service, 
including a partnership with exclusive financial 
specialists to deliver life and retirement solutions. 

Growth  We are expanding distribution by 

strategically increasing the number of agency owners 
and licensed sales professionals based on market 
opportunities with a focus on penetrating underserved 
markets.  We utilize targeted marketing, with 
messaging that communicates the value of our Good 
Hands®, the importance of having proper coverage, 
product options, and the ease of doing business with 
Allstate and our exclusive agencies.

Broader Customer Relationships   Our trusted 

advisor initiative is a critical component to creating 
broader relationships by positioning agents, licensed 
sales professionals and exclusive financial specialists to 
better know their customers and their unique 

protection needs.  Being a trusted advisor means that 
our agencies:

• Have a local presence that instills confidence
• Know their customers and understand the unique

needs of their households

• Help our customers assess the potential risks they face
• Provide local expertise and personalized guidance on

how to protect what matters most to customers by
offering customized solutions

• Support customers when they have changes in their

lives and during their times of need

Allstate exclusive agencies offer life and retirement 

solutions and can engage with exclusive financial 
specialists who provide expertise with advanced life 
and retirement cases and other financial needs of our 
customers. 

We support our exclusive agencies and financial 

specialists, through marketing assistance, service and 
business processes, education, offering financing to 
grow their businesses and other resources to help 
them enhance the customer experience and to acquire 
and retain more customers.  

We utilize the Net Promoter Score to measure how 

we serve our customers and how likely our customers 
are to recommend Allstate.  It brings together 
customer survey data from our brands including 
Allstate, Esurance, and Encompass along with 
SquareTrade and Allstate Roadside Services included 
in our Services Businesses segment.  The score is 

2017 Annual Report  91

Business  Segment Information 

calculated by weighting the net written premium 
contribution of each business to the overall enterprise, 
with the Allstate brand comprising approximately 90% 
of the score.  The Net Promoter Score improved 1.6 
points during 2017, with Allstate brand, Esurance and 
SquareTrade all showing improvements.  

Exclusive Agency Compensation Structure  The 

compensation structure for Allstate exclusive agencies 
rewards agencies for delivering high value to 
customers and achieving certain business outcomes 
such as product profitability, net growth and household 
penetration.  Allstate exclusive agent remuneration 
comprises a base commission, variable compensation 
and a bonus.  

• Variable compensation includes factors such as

customer satisfaction and life insurance and
retirement policies sold relative to the size of the
agency.

• Bonus compensation is based on a percentage of
premiums and can be earned by agents who are
meeting certain sales goals and selling additional
policies to meet customer needs profitably.

Allstate exclusive agencies have the ability to earn

commissions and additional bonuses on non-
proprietary products provided to consumers when an 
Allstate product is not available.  

Allstate exclusive financial specialists receive 

commissions for proprietary and non-proprietary sales 
and earn a bonus based on the volume of business 
produced with Allstate exclusive agents.  

Allstate independent agent remuneration 

comprises a base commission and a bonus that can be 
earned by agents who achieve a target loss ratio. 

Best-in-class Operational Capabilities  We are 

actively focusing on enhancing the customer 
experience through the following strategic efforts: 

•

•

Improve our core operations is focused on
enhanced loss cost management, expense control
and customer experience.  To achieve this, we are
continuing to modernize our operating platform
(including enhanced digital capabilities), improving
estimating accuracy and optimizing vendor
relationships.

Invest in our foundation is focused on leveraging
operational efficiency, mitigating risk, quality
assurance and a continued pursuit to automate
and simplify processes.  To achieve this, we are
investing in long-term growth platforms,
leveraging continuous improvement, enabling
consistent data and metrics, and modernizing
claims handling through digitization.

• Lead into our future is focused on leveraging

emerging technologies and predictive analytics to
simplify the customer experience and expedite the
claims process.  To achieve this, we have opened
several Digital Operating Centers to handle auto
claims countrywide utilizing our virtual estimation
capabilities, which includes estimating damage
through photos and video with the use of

QuickFoto Claim® and Virtual AssistSM (video chat 
technology used to review supplemental damage 
with auto body shops).  We are assessing wind and 
hail property claims using drones, piloted airplanes 
and satellite imagery. 

Esurance strategy 

Our strategy is to drive higher growth across all 
lines of business, improve our competitive position, 
maintain focus on expense management, and increase 
retention through investments in processes and 
operations to improve the customer experience.  To 
best serve our self-directed customers we:

• Offer a seamless online and mobile experience.

• Provide hassle-free purchases and claims

processing using regionalized call centers and
intuitive tools.

• Offer a broad suite of protection products and

solutions to our customers.

• Offer innovative product options and features.

Encompass strategy 

Our strategy is to expand the agent footprint, 

geographic diversification, enhance pricing and 
underwriting sophistication and operational excellence 
in underwriting and claims processes.  Over the past 
several years, Encompass has been executing on a 
profit improvement plan emphasizing pricing, 
governance and operational improvements at both the 
state and countrywide level.  These actions have 
improved underlying profitability but led to a reduction 
of policies in force, new issued applications, and the 
renewal ratio compared to prior years for both auto 
and homeowners.  

While profit improvement actions continue in many 

markets, targeted growth plans are in place for states 
with sustainable profitability trends and long-term 
growth potential.  We are also focused on growing our 
independent agency distribution partners who 
understand the value of our products.  

Answer Financial strategy

Our strategy as a technology-enabled insurance 

agency is to provide comparison shopping and related 
services for businesses, offering customers choice, 
convenience and ease of use.

Allstate Protection Pricing and Risk Management 
Strategies  

Our pricing and underwriting strategies and 
decisions are designed to generate sustainable 
profitable growth.  

Our proprietary database of underwriting and 

pricing experience enables sophisticated pricing 
algorithms and methodologies to more accurately 
price risks while also seeking to attract and retain 
customers in multiple risk segments.  

• For auto insurance, risk evaluation factors can

include, but are not limited to, vehicle make, model
and year; driver age and marital status; territory;

years licensed; loss history; years insured with 
prior carrier; prior liability limits; prior lapse in 
coverage; and insurance scoring utilizing 
telematics data and certain consumer report 
information.  

• For property insurance, risk evaluation factors can

include, but are not limited to, the amount of
insurance purchased; geographic location of the
property; loss history; age, condition and
construction characteristics of the property; and
characteristics of the insured including insurance
scoring utilizing certain consumer report
information.

A combination of underwriting information, pricing

and discounts are also used to achieve a more 
competitive position and growth.  Our pricing strategy 
involves local marketplace pricing and underwriting 
decisions that are based on these risk evaluation 
factors and an evaluation of competitors to the extent 
permissible by applicable law.

Pricing of property products is intended to 

establish risk-adjusted returns that are acceptable over 
a long-term period.  

We pursue rate increases to keep pace with loss 
trends, including losses from catastrophic events and 
those that are weather-related (such as wind, hail, 
lightning and freeze not meeting our criteria to be 
declared a catastrophe).  We also take into 
consideration potential customer disruption, the 
impact on our ability to market our auto and 
homeowners lines, regulatory limitations, our 
competitive position and profitability. 

Therefore, in any reporting period, loss experience 

from catastrophic events and weather-related losses 
may contribute to negative or positive underwriting

performance relative to the expectations we 
incorporated into product pricing.  

We manage our property catastrophe exposure 

with the goal of providing shareholders an acceptable 
return on the risks assumed in our property business 
and to reduce the variability of our earnings.  Our 
property business includes personal homeowners, 
commercial property and other property insurance 
lines.  As of December 31, 2017, we have less than a 1% 
likelihood of exceeding average annual aggregate 
catastrophe losses by $2 billion, net of reinsurance, 
from hurricanes and earthquakes, based on modeled 
assumptions and applications currently available.  The 
use of different assumptions and updates to industry 
models, and updates to our risk transfer program, 
could materially change the projected loss.  Our growth 
strategies include areas where we believe we can 
enhance diversification and earn an appropriate return 
for the risk and as a result our modeled exposure may 
increase, but in aggregate remain lower than $2 billion 
as noted above.  In addition, we have exposure to other 
severe weather events, which impact catastrophe 
losses.

Property catastrophe exposure management 

includes purchasing reinsurance to provide coverage 
for known exposure to hurricanes, earthquakes, 
wildfires, fires following earthquakes and other 
catastrophes.  We are also working to promote 
measures to prevent and mitigate losses and make 
homes and communities more resilient, including 
enactment of stronger building codes and effective 
enforcement of those codes, adoption of sensible land 
use policies, and development of effective and 
affordable methods of improving the resilience of 
existing structures.

Allstate Protection differentiates itself by offering solutions to meet broad-based household protection needs and 

a comprehensive range of innovative product options and features through distribution channels that best suit each 
consumer segment.

Allstate Benefits Segment
Strategy 

The Allstate Benefits segment provides consumers 

with financial protection against the risk of accidents, 
illness, and mortality.  We are an industry leader in the 
rapidly growing voluntary benefits market, offering a 
broad range of products through workplace 
enrollment.  Market trends for voluntary benefits are 
favorable as the market has doubled in size over the 
last decade, driven by the ability of voluntary benefits 
to fill the increasing financial burden placed on 
employees from employers seeking to contain rising 
benefit costs.  We have introduced new products and 
enhanced existing products to address these financial 
gaps by providing protection for catastrophic events 
such as a critical illness, accident or hospital stay.  We 
are expanding our life capabilities, offering employer 
paid group term life in addition to employee paid 
individual and group term and permanent life solutions.

Our products are offered through a network of 

independent agents and Allstate exclusive agencies.  
We differentiate ourselves by offering a broad product 
portfolio, flexible enrollment solutions and technology 
(including significant presence on employer benefit 
administration systems), and our strong national 
accounts team, as well as the well-recognized Allstate 
brand.

Our strategy for growth includes investing in new 
generation enrollment and administrative technology 
to improve our customer experience and modernize 
our operating model, continued expansion of our 
national accounts team relationships, deeper 
engagement with independent agents and Allstate 
agencies, and continued investment in product 
innovation.

Allstate Annuities Segment
Strategy  

The Allstate Annuities segment consists of 

deferred fixed annuities and immediate fixed annuities 
(including standard and sub-standard structured 
settlements).  The segment is in run-off and is focused 
on increasing lifetime economic value.  Both the 
deferred and immediate annuity businesses have been 
adversely impacted by the historically low interest rate 
environment.  Our immediate annuity business has also 
been impacted by medical advancements that have 
resulted in annuitants living longer than anticipated 
when many of these contracts were originated.  

Allstate Annuities focuses on the distinct risk and 

return profiles of the specific products when 
developing investment and liability management 
strategies.  The level of legacy deferred annuities in 
force has been significantly reduced and the 
investment portfolio and crediting rates are proactively 
managed to improve profitability of the business while 
providing appropriate levels of liquidity.  

The investment portfolio supporting our 

immediate annuities is managed to ensure the assets 
match the characteristics of the liabilities and provide 
the long-term returns needed to support this business.  
To better match the long-term nature of our immediate 
annuities, we continue to increase performance-based 
investments in which we have ownership interests and 
a greater proportion of return is derived from 
idiosyncratic asset or operating performance.  While 
we anticipate higher returns on these investments over 
time, the investment income can vary significantly 
between periods.

We continue to review strategic options to reduce 

exposure and improve returns of the business.  As a 
result, we may take additional operational and financial 
actions that offer return improvement and risk 
reduction opportunities.

Products and Distribution

We previously offered and continue to have in 
force deferred fixed annuities and immediate fixed 
annuities (including standard and sub-standard 
structured settlements).  We exited the continuing sale 
of annuities over an eight year period from 2006 to 
2014, reflecting our expectations of declining returns. 
In 2006, we disposed of substantially all of the variable 
annuity business through reinsurance agreements.  For 
discussion of non-proprietary retirement and 
investment products sold through our Allstate 
exclusive agencies and exclusive financial specialists, 
see the Allstate Life Segment of this report.

Segment Information  Business  

Other Business Segments
Discontinued Lines and Coverages Segment

The Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment 
includes results from property and casualty insurance 
coverage that primarily relates to policies written 
during the 1960s through the mid-1980s. 

Strategy  We have assigned management of this 
segment to a designated group of professionals with 
expertise in claims handling, policy coverage 
interpretation, exposure identification and reinsurance 
collection.  As part of its responsibilities, this group 
may at times be engaged in policy buybacks, 
settlements and reinsurance assumed and ceded 
commutations. 

We may continue to experience development in 

the reserves established for asbestos and/or 
environmental losses in the future, which could be due 
to the potential adverse impact of new information 
relating to new and additional claims or the impact of 
resolving unsettled claims based on unanticipated 
events such as arbitrations, litigation, legislative, 
judicial or regulatory actions.  Environmental losses 
may also increase as the result of additional funding for 
environmental site cleanup. 

We continue to address challenges related to the 

concentration of insurance and reinsurance claims from 
companies who specialize in this business. 

Corporate and Other Segment

Our Corporate and Other segment is comprised of 
holding company activities and certain non-insurance 
operations.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Overview

The following discussion highlights significant 

factors influencing the consolidated financial position 
and results of operations of The Allstate Corporation 
(referred to in this document as “we,” “our,” “us,” the 
“Company” or “Allstate”).  It should be read in 
conjunction with the 5-year summary of selected 
financial data, consolidated financial statements and 
related notes.  

In fourth quarter 2017, we changed from four to 
seven reportable segments.  These segments align 
with our key product and service offerings and reflect 
the manner in which our chief operating decision 
maker reviews performance and makes decisions 
about the allocation of resources.  To conform to the 
current year presentation, certain amounts in the prior 
years’ financial information have been updated to 
reflect changes in reportable segments.  For additional 
information on the changes in reportable segments, 
see Notes 1, 2 and 4 of the consolidated financial 
statements.

The most important factors we monitor to evaluate 

the financial condition and performance for our 
reportable segments and the Company include:

• Allstate Protection: premium, policies in force

(“PIF”), new business sales, policy retention, price
changes, claim frequency and severity,
catastrophes, loss ratio, expenses, underwriting
results, and relative competitive position.

• Service Businesses: revenues, premium written,

PIF, adjusted net income and net income.

• Allstate Life: premiums and contract charges, new

business sales, PIF, benefit spread, expenses,
adjusted net income and net income.

• Allstate Benefits: premiums, new business sales,
PIF, benefit ratio, expenses, adjusted net income
and net income.

• Allstate Annuities: investment spread, asset-

liability matching, contract benefits, expenses,
adjusted net income, net income and invested
assets.

•

Investments: exposure to market risk, asset
allocation, credit quality/experience, total return,
net investment income, cash flows, realized capital
gains and losses, unrealized capital gains and
losses, stability of long-term returns, and asset and
liability duration.

• Financial condition: liquidity, parent holding

company deployable assets, financial strength
ratings, operating leverage, debt levels, book value
per share and return on equity.

Measuring segment profit or loss

The measure of segment profit or loss used in 

evaluating performance is underwriting income for the 
Allstate Protection and Discontinued Lines and 
Coverages segments and adjusted net income for the 
Service Businesses, Allstate Life, Allstate Benefits, 
Allstate Annuities, and Corporate and Other segments. 

Underwriting income is calculated as premiums 

earned, less claims and claims expense (“losses”), 
amortization of DAC, operating costs and expenses 
and restructuring and related charges, as determined 
using accounting principles generally accepted in the 
United States of America (“GAAP”).  We use this 
measure in our evaluation of results of operations to 
analyze the profitability of the Property-Liability 
insurance operations separately from investment 
results.  Underwriting income is reconciled to net 
income applicable to common shareholders in the 
Property-Liability Results section of Management’s 
Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”).

Adjusted net income is net income applicable to 

common shareholders, excluding:

• Realized capital gains and losses, after-tax, except for

periodic settlements and accruals on non-hedge
derivative instruments, which are reported with realized
capital gains and losses but included in adjusted net
income

• Valuation changes on embedded derivatives not

hedged, after-tax

• Amortization of DAC and DSI, to the extent they

resulted from the recognition of certain realized capital
gains and losses or valuation changes on embedded
derivatives not hedged, after-tax

• Business combination expenses and the amortization

of purchased intangible assets, after-tax

• Gain (loss) on disposition of operations, after-tax
• Adjustments for other significant non-recurring,

infrequent or unusual items, when (a) the nature of the
charge or gain is such that it is reasonably unlikely to
recur within two years, or (b) there has been no similar
charge or gain within the prior two years

Adjusted net income is reconciled to net income 

applicable to common shareholders in the Service 
Businesses, Allstate Life, Allstate Benefits and Allstate 
Annuities Segment sections of MD&A.

2017 Highlights

($ in billions)

Consolidated Net Income

2017 vs. 2016 - Increase was primarily due to higher Allstate 
Protection insurance premiums, a tax benefit from the Tax 
Legislation, net realized capital gains in 2017 compared to 
net realized capital losses in 2016, higher net investment 
income, lower claims and claims expense, partially offset by 
higher catastrophe losses.  The Property-Liability combined 
ratio was 93.6 in 2017 compared to 96.0 in 2016.
2016 vs. 2015 - Decrease was primarily due to higher claims 
and claims expense and catastrophe losses, net realized 
capital losses in 2016 compared to net realized capital gains 
in 2015 and lower net investment income, partially offset by 
higher Allstate Protection insurance premiums. 

($ in billions)

Total Revenue

2017 vs. 2016 - Increase was primarily due to higher Allstate 
Protection insurance premiums, net realized capital gains in 
2017 compared to net realized capital losses in 2016, higher 
net investment income and the acquisition of SquareTrade.  

2016 vs. 2015 - Increase was primarily due to higher Allstate 
Protection insurance premiums and life and annuity 
premiums and contract charges, partially offset by net 
realized capital losses in 2016 compared to net realized 
capital gains in 2015 and lower net investment income. 

($ in billions)

Net Investment Income

2017 vs. 2016 - 2017 benefited from strong performance-
based results, primarily from limited partnerships, an 
increase in invested assets and stable market-based yields, 
partially offset by higher employee-related expenses.  
Limited partnership income reflects continued growth of our 
performance-based portfolio and included asset 
appreciation and sales of underlying investments.

2016 vs. 2015 - Decrease was primarily due to lower fixed 
income yields resulting from lower market yields and 
portfolio repositioning (including both the 2015 maturity 
profile shortening in the portfolio supporting annuity 

was primarily due to higher premiums and contract 
charges, partially offset by higher contract benefits 
and operating costs and expenses.  Premiums and 
contract charges totaled $1.28 billion in 2017, an 
increase of 2.4% from $1.25 billion in 2016.

Allstate Benefits adjusted net income was $95 

million in 2017 compared to $100 million in 2016.  The 
decrease was primarily due to higher contract benefits 
and operating costs and expenses, partially offset by 
higher premiums and contract charges.  Premiums and 
contract charges totaled $1.08 billion in 2017, an 
increase of 7.2% from $1.01 billion in 2016.

Allstate Annuities adjusted net income was $204 
million in 2017 compared to $101 million in 2016.  The 
increase was primarily due to higher net investment 
income, lower interest credited to contractholder funds 
and lower contract benefits.  Net investment income 
increased 10.5% to $1.31 billion in 2017 from $1.18 billion 
in 2016. 

Segment Highlights

Allstate Protection underwriting income totaled 

$2.11 billion in 2017, a 59.1% increase from $1.33 billion in 
2016, primarily due to increased premiums earned, 
higher favorable prior year reserve reestimates and 
lower loss costs, partially offset by higher catastrophe 
losses. 

Service Businesses adjusted net loss was $59 

million in 2017 compared to adjusted net income of $3 
million in 2016.  The loss in 2017 was primarily due to 
investments in Arity’s research and development, 
strategic investments in SquareTrade and Allstate 
Roadside Services, a SquareTrade restructuring charge 
and Hurricane Harvey’s impacts on Allstate Dealer 
Services.  Premiums written totaled $1.09 billion in 
2017, an increase of 54.3% from $709 million in 2016, 
primarily due to the acquisition of SquareTrade.

Allstate Life adjusted net income was $253 million 
in 2017 compared to $247 million in 2016.  The increase

Tax Reform  

Other Financial Highlights

On December 22, 2017, Public Law 115-97, known as 

the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“Tax Legislation”) 
became effective, permanently reducing the U.S. 
corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning 
January 1, 2018.  The Law changed the international 
system of taxation to a modified territorial system.  
The Tax Legislation resulted in a revaluation of 
Allstate’s deferred tax assets and liabilities and the 
recognition of a transition tax liability for non-U.S. 
income from international subsidiaries, resulting in a 
$506 million reduction to income tax expense or a 
$1.38 per share benefit to earnings per common share 
for the year ended December 31, 2017.  The impact of 
Tax Legislation is excluded from adjusted net income 
when evaluating segment performance.

We anticipate an effective tax rate between 19% 

and 20% for 2018.  The actual effective tax rate in 2018 
may differ from our estimate.  The reduced applicable 
tax rate is expected to result in overall lower tax 
expense beginning in 2018, a portion of which will be 
used to accelerate growth investments and improve 
the employee value propositions.  For a more detailed 
discussion of the Tax Legislation, see Note 15 of the 
consolidated financial statements.  

Book value per diluted common share (ratio of 

common shareholders’ equity to total common shares 
outstanding and dilutive potential common shares 
outstanding) was $57.58 as of December 31, 2017, an 
increase of 13.4% from $50.77 as of December 31, 2016.

Investments totaled $82.80 billion as of 

December 31, 2017, increasing from $81.80 billion as of 
December 31, 2016.

Return on average common shareholders’ equity  

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, 
return on the average of beginning and ending period 
common shareholders’ equity of 15.5% increased by 6.0 
points from 9.5% for the twelve months ended 
December 31, 2016. 

Shareholders’ equity  As of December 31, 2017, 
shareholders’ equity was $22.55 billion.  This total 
included $1.95 billion in deployable assets at the parent 
holding company level comprising cash and 
investments that are generally saleable within one 
quarter.

SquareTrade Acquisition  On January 3, 2017, we 

acquired SquareTrade, a consumer product protection 
plan provider that distributes through many of 
America’s major retailers and Europe’s mobile 
operators, for $1.4 billion in cash.  SquareTrade 
provides consumer electronic and appliance protection 
plans, covering products including TVs, smartphones 
and computers.  This acquisition broadens Allstate’s 
unique product offerings to better meet consumers’ 
needs.

Pension settlement loss  During 2017, the 

Company’s qualified employee pension plan 2017 lump 
sum payments exceeded a threshold of service and 
interest cost, which resulted in a pension settlement 
loss of $122 million, pre-tax, and was recorded as part 
of operating costs and expenses in the Corporate and 
Other segment.

Goodwill impairment  In conjunction with the 

adoption of new reportable segments in fourth quarter 
2017, we recognized goodwill impairment of $125 
million for goodwill allocated to the Allstate Annuities 
reporting unit.  The impairment was recorded within 
the Corporate and Other segment.

Property-Liability Operations

Overview  Our Property-Liability operations 

consist of two reportable segments: Allstate Protection 
and Discontinued Lines and Coverages.  These 
segments are consistent with the groupings of 
financial information that management uses to 
evaluate performance and to determine the allocation 
of resources.

We do not allocate Property-Liability investment 
income, realized capital gains and losses, or assets to 
the Allstate Protection and Discontinued Lines and 
Coverages segments.  Management reviews assets at 
the Property-Liability level for decision-making 
purposes.   

The table below includes GAAP operating ratios we 

use to measure our profitability.  We believe that they 
enhance an investor’s understanding of our 
profitability.  They are calculated as follows:

• Loss ratio - the ratio of claims and claims expense

to premiums earned.  Loss ratios include the
impact of catastrophe losses.

• Expense ratio - the ratio of amortization of DAC,
operating costs and expenses, and restructuring
and related charges to premiums earned.

• Combined ratio - the ratio of claims and claims

expense, amortization of DAC, operating costs and
expenses, and restructuring and related charges
to premiums earned.  The combined ratio is the
sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio.  The
difference between 100% and the combined ratio
represents underwriting income as a percentage of
premiums earned, or underwriting margin.

Property-Liability Operations 

We have also calculated the following impacts of 

specific items on the GAAP operating ratios because of 
the volatility of these items between fiscal periods.

• Effect of catastrophe losses on combined ratio -
the ratio of catastrophe losses included in claims
and claims expense to premiums earned.  This
ratio includes prior year reserve reestimates of
catastrophe losses.

• Effect of prior year reserve reestimates on

combined ratio - the ratio of prior year reserve
reestimates included in claims and claims expense
to premiums earned.  This ratio includes prior year
reserve reestimates of catastrophe losses.

• Effect of amortization of purchased intangible

assets on combined ratio - the ratio of
amortization of purchased intangible assets to
premiums earned.  Amortization of purchased
intangible assets is reported in operating costs
and expenses on the Consolidated Statements of
Operations.

• Effect of restructuring and related charges on
combined ratio - the ratio of restructuring and
related charges to premiums earned.

• Effect of Discontinued Lines and Coverages on
combined ratio - the ratio of claims and claims
expense and operating costs and expenses in the
Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment to
Property-Liability premiums earned.  The sum of
the effect of Discontinued Lines and Coverages on
the combined ratio and the Allstate Protection
combined ratio is equal to the Property-Liability
combined ratio.

Net investment income increased 18.0% or $225 million to $1.48 billion in 2017 from $1.25 billion in 2016 after 
increasing 2.2% in 2016 compared to 2015.  The 2017 increase benefited from strong performance-based results, 
primarily from limited partnerships, an increase in invested assets and stable market-based yields, partially offset by 
higher employee-related expenses.  Limited partnership income included asset appreciation and sales of underlying 
investments.  The 2016 increase was primarily due to higher equity dividends and higher limited partnership income.

Allstate Protection  Segment Results 

Underwriting income totaled $2.11 billion in 2017, a 59.1% increase from $1.33 billion in 2016, primarily due to 

increased premiums earned, lower loss costs and higher favorable prior year reserve reestimates, partially offset by 
higher catastrophe losses.  Underwriting income totaled $1.33 billion in 2016, an 18.1% decrease from $1.62 billion in 
2015, primarily due to higher catastrophe losses and rising loss costs, partially offset by increased premiums earned. 

Premiums written is the amount of premiums charged for policies issued during a fiscal period.  Premiums are 

considered earned and are included in the financial results on a pro-rata basis over the policy period.  The portion of 
premiums written applicable to the unexpired term of the policies is recorded as unearned premiums on our 
Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.

Catastrophe losses were $3.23 billion in 2017 compared to $2.57 billion in 2016 and $1.72 billion in 2015. We define a 
“catastrophe” as an event that produces pre-tax losses before reinsurance in excess of $1 million and involves multiple 
first party policyholders, or a winter weather event that produces a number of claims in excess of a preset, per-event 
threshold of average claims in a specific area, occurring within a certain amount of time following the event.  
Catastrophes are caused by various natural events including high winds, winter storms and freezes, tornadoes, 
hailstorms, wildfires, tropical storms, tsunamis, hurricanes, earthquakes and volcanoes.  We are also exposed to man-
made catastrophic events, such as certain types of terrorism or industrial accidents.  The nature and level of 
catastrophes in any period cannot be reliably predicted.

Catastrophe management

Historical catastrophe experience    For the last ten 

years, the average annual impact of catastrophes on 
our loss ratio was 8.7 points, but it has varied from 4.5 
points to 14.7 points.  The average annual impact of 
catastrophes on the homeowners loss ratio for the last 
ten years was 33.5 points.  Over time, we have limited 
our aggregate insurance exposure to catastrophe 
losses in certain regions of the country that are subject 
to high levels of natural catastrophes, limited by our 
participation in various state facilities.  For further 
discussion of these facilities, see Note 14 of the 
consolidated financial statements.  However, the 
impact of these actions may be diminished by the 
growth in insured values, and the effect of state 
insurance laws and regulations.  In addition, in various 
states we are required to participate in assigned risk 
plans, reinsurance facilities and joint underwriting 
associations that provide insurance coverage to 
individuals or entities that otherwise are unable to 
purchase such coverage from private insurers.  
Because of our participation in these and other state 
facilities such as wind pools, we may be exposed to 
losses that surpass the capitalization of these facilities 
and to assessments from these facilities.

We have continued to take actions to maintain an 

appropriate level of exposure to catastrophic events 
while continuing to meet the needs of our customers, 
including the following:

•

•

• Continuing to limit or not offer new homeowners,
manufactured home and landlord package policy
business in certain coastal geographies.
Increased capacity in our brokerage platform for
customers not offered an Allstate policy.
In 2016, we began to write a limited number of
homeowners policies in select areas of California.
We continue to renew current policyholders and
allow replacement policies for existing customers
who buy a new home, or change their residence to
rental property.  Additionally, we write
homeowners coverage through  North Light
Specialty Insurance Company (“NorthLight”), which
includes earthquake coverage (other than fire
following earthquakes) that is currently ceded via
quota share reinsurance.
In certain states, we have been ceding wind
exposure related to insured property located in
wind pool eligible areas.

•

• Starting in the second quarter of 2017, we are

writing a limited number of homeowners policies in
select areas of Florida and focusing on existing
customers who replace their currently-insured
home with an acceptable property.  Encompass
withdrew from property lines in Florida in 2009.

• Tropical cyclone deductibles are generally higher

than all peril deductibles and are in place for a
large portion of coastal insured properties.

• We have additional catastrophe exposure, beyond

the property lines, for auto customers who have
purchased physical damage coverage.  Auto
physical damage coverage generally includes
coverage for flood-related loss.  We manage this

Allstate Protection  Segment Results 

additional exposure through inclusion of auto 
losses in our nationwide reinsurance program, 
including Florida personal lines automobile 
business, as of June 1, 2016.  New Jersey is 
excluded from the nationwide reinsurance program 
as auto losses are included in our New Jersey 
reinsurance program.

• Designed a homeowners new business offering

available in 41 states, Allstate House and Home®,
that provides options of coverage for roof damage,
including graduated coverage and pricing based
on roof type and age.
Hurricanes    We consider the greatest areas of

potential catastrophe losses due to hurricanes 
generally to be major metropolitan centers in counties 
along the eastern and gulf coasts of the United States.  
Usually, the average premium on a property policy near 
these coasts is greater than in other areas.  However, 
average premiums are often not considered 
commensurate with the inherent risk of loss.  In 
addition and as explained in Note 14 of the 
consolidated financial statements, in various states 
Allstate is subject to assessments from assigned risk 
plans, reinsurance facilities and joint underwriting 
associations providing insurance for wind related 
property losses.

We have addressed our risk of hurricane loss by, 

among other actions, purchasing reinsurance for 
specific states and on a countrywide basis for our 
personal lines property insurance in areas most 
exposed to hurricanes, limiting personal homeowners, 
landlord package policy and manufactured home new 
business writings in coastal areas in southern and 
eastern states, implementing tropical cyclone 
deductibles where appropriate, and not offering 
continuing coverage on certain policies in coastal 
counties in certain states.  We continue to seek 
appropriate returns for the risks we write.  This may 
require further actions, similar to those already taken, 
in geographies where we are not getting appropriate 
returns.  However, we may maintain or 
opportunistically increase our presence in areas where 
we achieve adequate returns and do not materially 
increase our hurricane risk.

Earthquakes    We do not offer earthquake 

coverage in most states.  We retain approximately 
26,000 PIF with earthquake coverage, primarily in 
Kentucky, due to regulatory and other reasons.  We 
purchase reinsurance in Kentucky and enter into 
arrangements in many states to make earthquake 
coverage available through non-proprietary insurers. 
We continue to have exposure to earthquake risk 

on certain policies that do not specifically exclude 
coverage for earthquake losses, including our auto 
policies, and to fires following earthquakes.  Allstate 
policyholders in California are offered coverage 
through the CEA, a privately-financed, publicly-
managed state agency created to provide insurance 
coverage for earthquake damage.  Allstate is subject to 
assessments from the CEA under certain 
circumstances as explained in Note 14 of the 
consolidated financial statements.  While North Light 
writes property policies in California, which can include

earthquake coverage, this coverage is 100% ceded via 
quota share reinsurance. 

Fires Following Earthquakes    Under a standard 

homeowners policy we cover fire losses, including 
those caused by an earthquake.  Actions taken related 
to our risk of loss from fires following earthquakes 
include restrictive underwriting guidelines in California 
for new business writings, purchasing reinsurance for 
Kentucky personal lines property risks, and purchasing 
nationwide occurrence reinsurance, excluding Florida 
and New Jersey.

Wildfires    Actions taken related to managing our 

risk of loss from wildfires include changing 
homeowners underwriting requirements in certain 
states and purchasing nationwide occurrence 
reinsurance.  We also have inspection programs to 
identify homes that are susceptible to wildfires.

Reinsurance    A description of our current 

catastrophe reinsurance program appears in Note 10 of 
the consolidated financial statements.

Expense ratio for Allstate Protection increased 0.5 points in 2017 compared to 2016.

When analyzing premium measures and statistics for all three brands the following calculations are used as 

described below.

• PIF:  Policy counts are based on items rather than
customers.  A multi-car customer would generate
multiple item (policy) counts, even if all cars were
insured under one policy.

• New issued applications:  Item counts of

automobile or homeowner insurance applications
for insurance policies that were issued during the
period, regardless of whether the customer was
previously insured by another Allstate Protection
brand.  Allstate brand includes automobiles added
by existing customers when they exceed the
number allowed (currently 10) on a policy.

• Average premium-gross written (“average

premium”):  Gross premiums written divided by
issued item count.  Gross premiums written
include the impacts from discounts, surcharges
and ceded reinsurance premiums and exclude the
impacts from mid-term premium adjustments and
premium refund accruals.  Average premiums
represent the appropriate policy term for each line.
Allstate and Esurance brand policy terms are 6
months for auto and 12 months for homeowners.
Encompass brand policy terms are 12 months for
auto and homeowners.

• Renewal ratio:  Renewal policies issued during the
period, based on contract effective dates, divided
by the total policies issued 6 months prior for auto
(generally 12 months prior for Encompass brand) or
12 months prior for homeowners.

(1) The 2017 column presents changes in 2017 compared to 2016.  The 2016 column presents changes in 2016 compared to 2015.

Underwriting income totaled $2.20 billion in 2017, a 

51.1% increase from $1.46 billion in 2016, primarily due 
to increased premiums earned, lower claim frequency 
and higher favorable prior year reserve reestimates, 
partially offset by higher catastrophe losses and higher 
agent and employee-related compensation costs.  

Underwriting income totaled $1.46 billion in 2016, a 
19.9% decrease from $1.82 billion in 2015, primarily due 
to lower homeowners underwriting income resulting 
from higher catastrophe losses and higher commercial 
lines underwriting losses due to rising loss costs, 
partially offset by increased auto underwriting income 
as a result of rate actions.

2016, following a 2.2% increase in 2016 from $1.59 billion 
in 2015.  The increase in 2017 was primarily due to

premium for condominium insurance, partially offset by 
a decreased volume of landlords insurance. 

Commercial lines premiums written totaled $488 

million in 2017, a 2.2% decrease from $499 million in 
2016, following a 3.3% decrease in 2016 from $516 
million in 2015.  The decreases in 2017 and 2016 were 
driven by decreased new business and lower renewals 
due to profit improvement actions, partially offset by 
increased average premiums.

Auto loss ratio decreased 6.4 points in 2017 

compared to 2016, primarily due to increased 
premiums earned, lower claim frequency and higher 
favorable prior year reserve reestimates, partially offset 
by higher catastrophe losses and higher claim severity.  
Auto loss ratio in 2016 was comparable to 2015, 
primarily due to increased catastrophe losses and 
rising loss costs, offset by increased premiums earned 
and favorable prior year reserve reestimates. 

Frequency and severity statistics, which are 

influenced by driving patterns, inflation and other 
factors, are provided to describe the trends in loss 
costs of the business.  Our reserving process 
incorporates changes in loss patterns, operational 
statistics and changes in claims reporting processes to 
determine our best estimate of recorded reserves. 

Paid claim frequency is calculated as annualized 

notice counts closed with payment in the period 
divided by the average of policies in force with the 
applicable coverage during the period.  Gross claim 
frequency is calculated as annualized notice counts 
received in the period divided by the average of 
policies in force with the applicable coverage during 
the period.  Gross claim frequency includes all actual 
notice counts, regardless of their current status (open 
or closed) or their ultimate disposition (closed with a 
payment or closed without payment).  Frequency 
statistics exclude counts associated with catastrophe 
events.  The percent change in paid or gross claim 
frequency is calculated as the amount of increase or 
decrease in the paid or gross claim frequency in the 
current period compared to the same period in the 
prior year; divided by the prior year paid or gross claim 
frequency.   

Paid claim frequency trends will often differ from 

gross claim frequency trends due to differences in the 
timing of when notices are received and when claims

are settled.  For property damage claims, paid 
frequency trends reflect little differences as timing 
between opening and settlement is minimal.  For 
bodily injury, gross frequency trends reflect emerging 
trends since the difference in timing between opening 
and settlement is much greater and gross frequency 
does not experience the same volatility in quarterly 
fluctuations seen in paid frequency.  In evaluating 
frequency, we typically rely upon paid frequency trends 
for physical damage coverages such as property 
damage and gross frequency for casualty coverages 
such as bodily injury to provide an indicator of 
emerging trends in overall claim frequency while also 
providing insights for our analysis of severity.  

Paid claim severity is calculated by dividing the 

sum of paid losses and loss expenses by claims closed 
with a payment during the period.  The percent change 
in paid claim severity is calculated as the amount of 
increase or decrease in paid claim severity in the 
current period compared to the same period in the 
prior year; divided by the prior year paid claims 
severity.  

We are continuing to aggressively seek new 

technology and process solutions to provide continued 
loss cost accuracy, efficient processing and enhanced 
customer experiences that are simple, fast and 
produce high degrees of satisfaction.  For example, we 
have opened several Digital Operating Centers to 
handle auto claims countrywide utilizing our virtual 
estimation capabilities, which includes estimating 
damage through photos and video with the use of 
QuickFoto Claim® and Virtual AssistSM.  These 
organizational and process changes have been 
beneficial to our operations as they are occurring, but 
frequency and severity statistics may be impacted as 
changes in claim opening and closing practices, if any, 
can impact comparisons to prior periods.

Property damage paid claim frequency decreased 
5.2% in 2017 compared to 2016, following an increase of 
0.3% in 2016 from 2015.  42 states experienced a year 
over year decrease in property damage paid claim 
frequency in 2017 when compared to 2016.  Property 
damage paid claim severities increased 4.5% in 2017 
compared to 2016, following an increase of 4.1% in 2016 
from 2015 due to higher costs to repair more 
sophisticated, newer model vehicles and increased 
volume of total losses. 

Bodily injury gross claim frequency decreased 4.8% 

in 2017 compared to 2016 and increased 0.5% in 2016 
compared to 2015.  Bodily injury paid claim frequency 
decreased 17.4% while bodily injury paid claim severity 
increased 22.0% in 2017 compared to 2016.  Claim 
process changes in the second half of 2016 related to 
enhanced documentation of injuries and related 
medical treatments are having a related impact on 
paid claim frequency and severity due to payment mix 
and claim closure patterns.  These process changes are 
beginning to normalize and the related impacts on the 
percent change in paid claim frequency and severity 
have begun to moderate.  Bodily injury paid claim 
frequency decreased 7.9% while bodily injury paid claim 
severity increased 4.7% in 2016 compared to 2015 and 
were also impacted by the claim process changes in 
the second half of 2016.  Paid claim severity was 
impacted by increases in medical inflationary trends 
that were offset by improvements in loss cost 
management.

Homeowners loss ratio increased 5.2 points to 66.2 

in 2017 from 61.0 in 2016, primarily due to higher 
catastrophe losses, partially offset by higher favorable 
prior year reserve reestimates and increased premiums

claim severity excluding catastrophe losses increased 
5.0% in 2017 compared to 2016.  Homeowner paid claim 
severity can be impacted by both the mix of perils and 
the magnitude of specific losses paid during the year.  
Homeowners loss ratio increased 5.4 points to 61.0 in 
2016 from 55.6 in 2015, primarily due to higher 
catastrophe losses, partially offset by increases in

to 2015.  Paid claim severity excluding catastrophe 
losses increased 0.9% in 2016 compared to 2015.  

Other personal lines loss ratio increased 2.3 points 
in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to unfavorable 
prior year reserve reestimates, higher catastrophe 
losses and higher claim severity, partially offset by 
increased premiums earned.  Other personal lines loss 
ratio increased 1.1 points in 2016 compared to 2015, 
primarily due to higher catastrophe losses, partially 
offset by favorable prior year reserve reestimates and 
increased premiums earned.

Commercial lines loss ratio decreased 18.4 points in 

2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to lower 
unfavorable prior year reserve reestimates, lower claim 
frequency and lower catastrophe losses.  Commercial 
lines loss ratio increased 15.5 points in 2016 compared 
to 2015, primarily due to higher unfavorable prior year 
reserve reestimates, higher claim severity and higher 
catastrophe losses. 

Catastrophe losses were $2.99 billion in 2017 

compared to $2.42 billion in 2016 and $1.59 billion in 
2015.

Expense ratio increased 0.8 points in 2017 

compared to 2016, primarily due to higher agent and 
employee-related compensation costs and 
restructuring and related costs.  Amortization of DAC 
primarily includes agent remuneration and premium 
taxes.  Allstate agency total incurred base 
commissions, variable compensation and bonuses in 
2017 were higher than 2016.

Expense ratio decreased 0.2 point in 2016 

compared to 2015.  The decrease primarily related to 
expense spending reductions in professional services 
and lower compensation incentives earned by 
employees in 2016, partially offset by an increase in the 
amortization of acquisition costs.  Allstate agency total 
incurred base commissions, variable compensation and 
bonuses in 2016 were higher than 2015.

compared to 2015.  Esurance has continued to invest in 
growth, including offering a comprehensive suite of 
products such as homeowners, motorcycle and usage-
based insurance as well as expanding into the 
Canadian market.  Esurance advertising expense ratio 
decreased 1.4 points in 2016 compared to 2015 in 
conjunction with our profitability actions.  Strategic 
reductions in marketing spending were made on auto 
while homeowners advertising spending was 
increased.  Other costs and expenses, including 
salaries of phone sales personnel and other 
underwriting costs related to customer acquisition, 
were lower in 2016 than 2015.

Expense ratio decreased 6.0 points in 2017 

compared to 2016.  Esurance uses a direct distribution 
model, therefore its primary acquisition-related costs 
are advertising as opposed to commissions.  Esurance 
advertising expense ratio decreased 2.9 points in 2017 
compared to 2016, primarily due to reductions in 
homeowners marketing.  Other costs and expenses, 
including salaries of phone sales personnel and other 
underwriting costs related to customer acquisition, 
were lower in 2017 compared to 2016 due to the 
implementation of process efficiencies.  Expense ratio 
includes amortization of purchased intangible assets 
from the original acquisition in 2011.  Starting in 2017, 
the portion of the remaining purchased intangible 
asset related to the Esurance brand name was 
classified as an infinite-lived intangible and is no longer 
being amortized, but instead tested for impairment on 
an annual basis.  

We continue to review our advertising spend to 

ensure our acquisition costs meet our targeted returns.  
Esurance incurs substantially all of its acquisition costs 
in the year of policy inception.  As a result, the 
Esurance expense ratio will be higher or lower 
depending on the advertising expenditures incurred 
related to our profitability actions.  Esurance’s annual 
combined ratio is below 100, after the year of policy 
inception (in which substantially all acquisition costs 
are incurred), driven by pricing changes, customer mix 
and renewal experience.

Underwriting loss totaled $33 million in 2017 

compared to underwriting income of $1 million in 2016, 
primarily due to higher homeowners catastrophe 
losses, partially offset by improved auto loss costs.  
Underwriting income totaled $1 million in 2016, an 
improvement from an underwriting loss of $26 million 

in 2015, primarily due to lower underwriting losses on 
other personal lines and auto and higher underwriting 
income on homeowners resulting from lower loss costs 
and expenses.

(2)  Rate changes that are indicated based on loss trend analysis to achieve a targeted return will continue to be pursued.  Rate

changes do not include rating plan enhancements, including the introduction of discounts and surcharges that result in no change
in the overall rate level in a location.  These rate changes do not reflect initial rates filed for insurance subsidiaries initially writing
business in a location.

(6)  Based on historical premiums written in the locations noted above, rate changes approved for auto totaled $37 million, $68 million
and $63 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Approximately 20% of the rate increases approved in 2017 are expected to be
earned in 2017, with the remainder expected to be earned in 2018 and 2019.

Auto insurance premiums written totaled $542 
million in 2017, a 8.3% decrease from $591 million in 
2016.    Factors impacting premiums written were:

Total expense ratio

Expense ratio increased 1.8 points in 2017 

compared to 2016, primarily due to higher employee-
related and technology costs, and restructuring and 
related charges.  During the first half of 2017, 
Encompass exited certain operations and right-sized 
certain departments consistent with business volume.  
The costs associated with these changes have been 
recorded as restructuring and related charges.  The 
Encompass brand DAC amortization rate is higher on 
average than Allstate brand DAC amortization due to 
higher commission rates paid to independent 
agencies.  

Catastrophe losses were $193 million in 2017 

compared to $111 million in both 2016 and 2015.

Discontinued Lines and Coverages Segment

The Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment includes results from property and casualty insurance coverage 

that primarily relates to policies written during the 1960s through the mid-1980s.  Our exposure to asbestos, 
environmental and other discontinued lines claims arises principally from direct excess commercial insurance, assumed 
reinsurance coverage, direct primary commercial insurance and other businesses in run-off.  For additional information 
on our strategy and outlook, see Business - Segment information.

Underwriting losses of $99 million in 2017 primarily
related to our annual reserve review using established 
industry and actuarial best practices, resulting in 
unfavorable reestimates of $85 million, including $61 
million for asbestos exposures, $10 million for 
environmental exposures and $27 million for other 
exposures, partially offset by a $13 million decrease in 
the allowance for future uncollectible reinsurance. 

Underwriting losses of $107 million in 2016 

primarily related to our annual reserve review  resulting 
in unfavorable reestimates of $96 million, including a 
$67 million unfavorable reestimate of asbestos 
reserves, a $23 million unfavorable reestimate of 
environmental reserves and a $6 million increase in the 
allowance for future uncollectible reinsurance with 
other exposure reserves essentially unchanged. 

Underwriting losses of $55 million in 2015 primarily 

related to our annual reserve review resulting in 
unfavorable reestimates of $44 million, including a $39 
million unfavorable reestimate of asbestos reserves, a 
$1 million unfavorable reestimate of environmental 
reserves and a $9 million unfavorable reestimate of 
other exposure reserves, partially offset by a $5 million 
decrease in the allowance for future uncollectible 
reinsurance.  

The cost of administering claims settlements 

totaled $11 million, $10 million and $10 million for 2017, 
2016 and 2015, respectively.

(1) Gross reserves as of December 31, 2017 comprised 65% case reserves and 35% incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) reserves.

Approximately 79% of the total gross case reserves are subject to settlement agreements.  In 2017, total gross payments from case
reserves were $126 million with approximately 88% attributable to settlements.  Reserves as of December 31, 2016 comprised 60%
case reserves and 40% IBNR reserves.

(2) Ceded reserves as of December 31, 2017 comprised 76% case reserves and 24% IBNR reserves.  Approximately 86% of the total

ceded case reserves are subject to settlement agreements.  In 2017, reinsurance billings of ceded case reserves were $55 million
with approximately 94% attributable to settlements.  Reserves as of December 31, 2016 comprised 74% case reserves and 26%
IBNR reserves.

(3) Gross reserves as of December 31, 2017 comprised 31% case reserves and 69% IBNR reserves.  In 2017, total gross payments from

case reserves were $54 million.  Reserves as of December 31, 2016 comprised 33% case reserves and 67% IBNR reserves.

(4) Ceded reserves as of December 31, 2017 comprised 36% case reserves and 64% IBNR reserves.  In 2017, reinsurance billings of
ceded case reserves were $3 million.  Reserves as of December 31, 2016 comprised 40% case reserves and 60% IBNR reserves.

(5) Gross reserves as of December 31, 2017 comprised 54% case reserves and 46% IBNR reserves. In 2017, total gross payments from

case reserves were $7 million. Reserves as of December 31, 2016 comprised 46% case reserves and 54% IBNR reserves.

(6) Ceded reserves as of December 31, 2017 comprised 76% case reserves and 24% IBNR reserves. In 2017, reinsurance billings of
ceded case reserves were $1 million. Reserves as of December 31, 2016 comprised 64% case reserves and 36% IBNR reserves.

Total net reserves included $733 million or 52% of 

estimated IBNR losses as of December 31, 2017 
compared to $800 million or 55% as of December 31, 
2016.  The net decrease of $67 million from year-end 
2016 relates to the transfer of IBNR to case reserves 
through settlement agreements reached with several 
insureds on large claims, mainly asbestos related 
losses, where the scope of coverages have been 
agreed.  

The claims associated with these agreements are 

expected to be substantially paid out over the next 
several years as qualified claims conforming to the 
settlement agreements are submitted by these 
insureds. Total gross payments were $192 million and 
$233 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively, with 
reinsurance collections of $67 million and $58 million 
for 2017 and 2016, respectively.

(1)  Intersegment insurance premiums and service fees are primarily related to Arity and Allstate Roadside Services and are eliminated

in our consolidated financial statements.

(2)  Primarily relates to a one-time contract termination of a SquareTrade European vendor.

Adjusted net loss was $59 million in 2017 compared 

to adjusted net income of $3 million and $2 million in 
2016 and 2015, respectively.  The loss in 2017 was 
primarily due to investments in Arity’s research and 
development, strategic investments in SquareTrade 
and Allstate Roadside Services, a SquareTrade 
restructuring charge and Hurricane Harvey’s impacts 
on Allstate Dealer Services. 

Premiums written increased 54.3% or $385 million 

to $1.09 billion in 2017 from $709 million in 2016, 

primarily due to the acquisition of SquareTrade and its 
growth through its U.S. retail channel, partially offset 
by decreases in premiums written at Allstate Roadside 
Services.  Premiums written decreased 6.2% or $47 
million to $709 million in 2016 from $756 million in 2015, 
driven by lower wholesale rescue volume primarily due 
to partner exits and lower retail memberships in force 
at Allstate Roadside Services and a decrease in 
guaranteed asset protection contracts due to rate 
increases at Allstate Dealer Services.  PIF increased by

million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, primarily due to 
Arity’s  device and mobile data collection services and 
analytic solutions used by Allstate brand, Esurance and 
Answer Financial.  We launched Arity, a non-insurance 
technology company in 2016 and therefore Arity's 
revenues are not comparable between periods.  

Claims and claims expense increased 43.0% to 

$369 million in 2017 from $258 million in 2016, primarily 
due to the acquisition of SquareTrade on January 3, 
2017.  Claims and claims expense decreased 6.9% to 
$258 million in 2016 from $277 million in 2015, primarily 
due to decreased business in Allstate Roadside 
Services and Allstate Dealer Services.

Operating costs and expenses increased 79.8% to 
$401 million in 2017 from $223 million and $164 million 
in 2016 and 2015, respectively, primarily due to the 
acquisition of SquareTrade on January 3, 2017, Allstate 
Roadside Services increase in strategic investments in 
the Good Hands Rescue Network, and investments in 
Arity’s research and development.

Contractual liability insurance policies. SquareTrade 

and Allstate Dealer Services issue contractual liability 
insurance policies or guaranteed asset protection 
reimbursement insurance policies to cover the 
liabilities of their products where required by state 
regulations.  The products offered through 
SquareTrade and Allstate Dealer Services fall under the 
regulation of departments of insurance in many states 
with requirements for filing of forms and rates varying 
by product and by state.

SquareTrade provides consumer electronic and 

appliance protection plans, covering products 
including TVs, smartphones and computers through 
retail distribution and mobile operator channels.  

Under these protection plans, SquareTrade agrees 

to repair, replace or indemnify the customer for the 
cost to repair or replace such products from 
mechanical or electrical failure due to normal wear and 
tear.  Protection plans also provide additional 
coverages beyond the manufacturer’s warranty, and in 
certain cases, accidental damage from handling.  

Premium revenue and claims and claims expense 
are recognized over the term of the protection plans.  
SquareTrade purchases contractual liability insurance 
from insurance companies to support claims 
settlements in the event SquareTrade is unable to fulfill 
its contractual obligations.  The arrangement results in 
SquareTrade recognizing the claims settlement costs.  
The insurer would recognize claims settlement costs 
only in the event SquareTrade is unable to fulfill its 
contractual obligation or if claims costs are in excess of 
pre-determined thresholds.  SquareTrade is generally 
required to deposit amounts expected to cover losses 
into a trust held for paying claims.

In conjunction with the acquisition of SquareTrade, 

we recognized $555 million of intangible assets for 
which we recognized amortization expense of $92 
million in 2017.  Intangible assets are being amortized 
on an accelerated basis, excluding the SquareTrade 
brand name which was classified as an infinite-lived 
intangible and will be tested for impairment on an 
annual basis, with approximately 75% of the balance 
expected to be amortized by 2021. 

Pending revenue recognition changes.  Beginning 

in first quarter 2018, we will adopt the Financial 
Accounting Standards Board issued guidance, which 
revises the criteria for revenue recognition.  The 
Service Businesses segment will be impacted by this 
standard.  For further discussion of impacts of these 
adjustments, see Note 2 of the consolidated financial 
statements.

Claims and Claims Expense Reserves 

Underwriting results are significantly influenced by 
estimates of claims and claims expense reserves.  For a 
description of our reserve process, see Note 8 of the 
consolidated financial statements.  Further, for a 
description of our reserving policies and the potential 
variability in our reserve estimates, see the Application 
of Critical Accounting Estimates section of the MD&A.  
These reserves are an estimate of amounts necessary 
to settle all outstanding claims, including IBNR claims, 
as of the reporting date.

 Claims and Claims Expense Reserves  Segment Results

The facts and circumstances leading to our 
reestimates of reserves relate to revisions to the 
development factors used to predict how losses are 
likely to develop from the end of a reporting period 
until all claims have been paid.  Reestimates occur 
because actual losses are likely different than those 
predicted by the estimated development factors used 
in prior reserve estimates. 

We believe the net loss reserves exposures are 
appropriately established based on available facts, 
technology, laws and regulations.

The year-end 2017 gross reserves of $26.3 billion 
for insurance claims and claims expense were $7.95 
billion more than the net reserve balance of $18.37 
billion recorded on the basis of statutory accounting 
practices for reports provided to state regulatory 
authorities.  The principal differences are reinsurance 
recoverables from third parties totaling $6.47 billion, 
including $5.23 billion related to the Michigan 
Catastrophic Claims Association (“MCCA”), that reduce 
reserves for statutory reporting but are recorded as 

assets for GAAP reporting, and a liability for the 
reserves of the Canadian subsidiaries for $1.32 billion 
that are a component of our consolidated reserves, but 
not included in our U.S. statutory reserves.  Remaining 
differences are due to variations in requirements 
between GAAP and statutory reporting.  The tables 
below show net reserves representing the estimated 
cost of outstanding claims as they were recorded at 
the beginning of years 2017, 2016 and 2015, and the 
effect of reestimates in each year.

Prior year reserve reestimates are developed 
based on factors that are calculated quarterly and 
periodically throughout the year for data elements 
such as claims reported and settled, paid losses and 
paid losses combined with case reserves.  These data 
elements are primarily responsible for revisions to loss 
development factors used to predict how losses are 
likely to develop from the end of a reporting period 
until all claims have been paid.  When actual 
development of these data elements is different than 
the historical development pattern used in a prior 
period reserve estimate, reserves are revised as 
actuarial studies validate new trends based on the 
indications of updated development factor 
calculations.  Claims organizational and process 
changes that are currently occurring are considered 
within our estimation process.

Favorable reserve reestimates for auto and 
homeowners in 2017 were primarily related to a 
reduction in claim severity estimates for liability 
coverages.  Auto liability claims process changes 
implemented in prior years, including a program 
requiring enhanced documentation of injuries and 
related medical treatments, have resulted in favorable 
severity trends compared to those originally estimated 
as we continue to develop greater experience in 
settling claims under these programs.  Auto liability 
legislative reforms, higher limits and longer settlement 
periods in Canada have resulted in uncertainty that has 
developed favorably as loss experience emerges.  
Unfavorable results for commercial lines in 2017 were 
primarily due to non-catastrophe auto loss 
development being higher than anticipated in previous 
estimates.  

Estimating the ultimate cost of claims and claims 

expenses is an inherently uncertain and complex 
process involving a high degree of judgment and is 
subject to the evaluation of numerous variables. 

Favorable auto reserve reestimates in 2016 were 

primarily due to severity development for auto liability 
coverages that was better than expected.  Auto 
reserve reestimates in 2015 were primarily due to claim 
severity development for bodily injury coverage for 
recent years that was more than expected and 
litigation settlements from older years for Allstate 
brand. 

Favorable homeowners reserve reestimates in 2016 

and 2015 were primarily due to severity development 
for liability coverages related to the timing of 
payments. 

Other personal lines reserve reestimates in 2016 

was primarily due to non-catastrophe loss 
development lower than anticipated in previous 
estimates.  Other personal lines reserve reestimates in 
2015 were primarily the result of non-catastrophe loss 
development higher than anticipated in previous 
estimates.

Commercial lines reserve reestimates in 2016 were 

primarily due to severity development for auto bodily 
injury coverage that was more than expected.  
Commercial lines reserve reestimates in 2015 were 
primarily the result of non-catastrophe loss 
development higher than anticipated in previous 
estimates.

Pending, new and closed claims for Allstate Protection are summarized in the following table for the years ended 
December 31.  The increase in pending claims as of December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016 was primarily 
due to an increase in the amount of time to settle claims.  The increase in pending claims as of December 31, 2016 
compared to December 31, 2015, was primarily due to higher auto claim counts.

We conduct an annual review in the third quarter 

of each year to evaluate and establish asbestos, 
environmental and other discontinued lines reserves.  
Reserves are recorded in the reporting period in which 
they are determined.  Using established industry and 
actuarial best practices and assuming no change in the 

regulatory or economic environment, this detailed and 
comprehensive methodology determines reserves 
based on assessments of the characteristics of 
exposure (e.g. claim activity, potential liability, 
jurisdiction, products versus non-products exposure)

Reserve additions for asbestos in 2017 were 

primarily related to new reported information and 
settlement agreements, including bankruptcy 
proceedings.  Reserve additions for asbestos in 2016 
were primarily related to insured business and claim 
development, new reported information on insured’s 
claims, expanded expected exposure periods and 
other legal settlements including insured’s bankruptcy 

proceedings.  Reserve additions for asbestos in 2015 
were primarily related to a settlement with a large 
insured and more reported claims than expected.

Reserve additions for environmental in 2017 and 
2016 were primarily related to greater reported loss 
activity than expected.  There were no significant

The survival ratio is calculated by taking our 

ending reserves divided by payments made during the 
year.  This is a commonly used but extremely simplistic 
and imprecise approach to measuring the adequacy of 
asbestos and environmental reserve levels.  Many 
factors, such as mix of business, level of coverage 
provided and settlement procedures have significant 
impacts on the amount of environmental and asbestos 

claims and claims expense reserves, claim payments 
and the resultant ratio.  As payments result in 
corresponding reserve reductions, survival ratios can 
be expected to vary over time.  In 2017, 2016 and 2015, 
the asbestos and environmental net 3-year survival 
ratio decreased due to increased claim payments 
associated with settlement agreements expected to 
be substantially paid out over the next several years.

During the last three years, 42 direct primary and 
excess policyholders reported new claims, and claims 
of 38 policyholders were closed, increasing the number 
of active policyholders by 4 during the period.  

• There was a net decrease of 4 policyholders in

2017, including 10 new policyholders reporting new
claims and the closing of 14 policyholders’ claims.

• There was a net increase of 2 policyholders in 2016,

including 17 new policyholders reporting new
claims and the closing of 15 policyholders’ claims.

• There was a net increase of 6 policyholders in 2015,

including 15 new policyholders reporting new
claims and the closing of 9 policyholders’ claims.

IBNR net reserves decreased $63 million as of

December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016 
due to the transfer of IBNR to case reserves through 
settlement agreements with insureds on large claims 
where the scope of coverages have been agreed.  IBNR 
provides for reserve development of known claims and 
future reporting of additional unknown claims from 
current policyholders and ceding companies.

Reinsurance ceded  We utilize reinsurance to 
reduce exposure to catastrophe risk and manage 
capital, and to support the required statutory surplus 
and the insurance financial strength ratings of certain 
subsidiaries such as Castle Key Insurance Company 
(“CKIC”)  and Allstate New Jersey Insurance Company.  
We purchase significant reinsurance to manage our 
aggregate countrywide exposure to an acceptable 
level.  The price and terms of reinsurance and the 
credit quality of the reinsurer are considered in the 
purchase process, along with whether the price can be 
appropriately reflected in the costs that are considered 
in setting future rates charged to policyholders.  We 

also participate in various reinsurance mechanisms, 
including industry pools and facilities, which are 
backed by the financial resources of the property and 
casualty insurance company market participants, and 
have historically purchased reinsurance to mitigate 
long-tail liability lines, including environmental, 
asbestos and other discontinued lines exposures.  We 
retain primary liability as a direct insurer for all risks 
ceded to reinsurers.  The MCCA provides 
indemnification for losses over a retention level and 
under the National Flood Insurance Program (“NFIP”) 
the Federal Government pays all covered claims and 
certain qualifying claim expenses.

respectively, and $5.23 billion and $4.92 billion of reinsurance recoverable on unpaid claims, respectively.

(3)  As of December 31, 2017, case reserves for MCCA, PLIGA, Lloyd’s and total Property-Liability were 83%, 100%, 64% and 82% of the 

reinsurance recoverable for unpaid claims, respectively. 
Reinsurance recoverables include an estimate of 
the amount of insurance claims and claims expense 
reserves that are ceded under the terms of the 
reinsurance agreements, including incurred but not 
reported unpaid losses.  We calculate our ceded 
reinsurance estimate based on the terms of each 
applicable reinsurance agreement, including an 
estimate of how IBNR losses will ultimately be ceded 
under the agreement.  We also consider other 
limitations and coverage exclusions under our 
reinsurance agreements.  Accordingly, our estimate of 
reinsurance recoverables is subject to similar risks and 
uncertainties as our estimate of reserves claims and 
claims expense.  We believe the recoverables are 
appropriately established; however, as our underlying 
reserves continue to develop, the amount ultimately 
recoverable may vary from amounts currently 
recorded.  We regularly evaluate the reinsurers and the 
respective amounts recoverable, and a provision for 
uncollectible reinsurance is recorded if needed.  The 
establishment of reinsurance recoverables and the 
related allowance for uncollectible reinsurance is also 
an inherently uncertain process involving estimates.  
Changes in estimates could result in additional 
changes to the Consolidated Statements of 
Operations.

The allowance for uncollectible reinsurance 

primarily relates to Discontinued Lines and Coverages 
reinsurance recoverables and was $70 million and $84 
million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  
The allowance for Discontinued Lines and Coverages 

represents 12.0% and 13.3% of the related reinsurance 
recoverable balances as of December 31, 2017 and 
2016, respectively.  The allowance is based upon our 
ongoing review of amounts outstanding, length of 
collection periods, changes in reinsurer credit standing, 
and other relevant factors.  In addition, in the ordinary 
course of business, we may become involved in 
coverage disputes with certain of our reinsurers that 
may ultimately result in lawsuits and arbitrations 
brought by or against such reinsurers to determine the 
parties’ rights and obligations under the various 
reinsurance agreements.  We employ dedicated 
specialists to manage reinsurance collections and 
disputes.  We also consider recent developments in 
commutation activity between reinsurers and cedents, 
and recent trends in arbitration and litigation 
outcomes in disputes between cedents and reinsurers 
in seeking to maximize our reinsurance recoveries.

Adverse developments in the insurance industry 
have led to a decline in the financial strength of some 
of our reinsurance carriers, causing amounts 
recoverable from them and future claims ceded to 
them to be considered a higher risk.  There has also 
been consolidation activity in the industry, which 
causes reinsurance risk across the industry to be 
concentrated among fewer companies.  In addition, 
some companies have segregated asbestos, 
environmental, and other discontinued lines exposures 
into separate legal entities with dedicated capital.  
Regulatory bodies in certain cases have supported 
these actions.  We are unable to determine the impact,

if any, that these developments will have on the 
collectability of reinsurance recoverables in the future.

For a detailed description of the MCCA, PLIGA and 

Lloyd’s, see Note 10 of the consolidated financial 

statements.  As of December 31, 2017, other than the 
recoverable balances listed in the table above, no other 
amount due or estimated to be due from any single 
reinsurer was in excess of $17 million.

$13 million of unallocated expenses were recorded in Other.  Reinsurance recoverables related to named storm Sandy also
decreased the ceded claims and claims expenses by $6 million.

In 2017, 2016 and 2015, ceded premiums earned 

decreased primarily due to decreased reinsurance 
premium rates and a decrease in policies written for 
the NFIP and MCCA.

In 2017, ceded claims and claims expenses 

increased $691 million, primarily due to higher amounts 
ceded to the NFIP related to claims as a result of 
Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.  Ceded claims and claims 
expenses increased in 2016, primarily due to higher 
amounts ceded to the NFIP as the result of Louisiana 
flooding.  Ceded claims and claims expense decreased 
in 2015 primarily due to lower reserve increases for the 
MCCA and PLIGA programs.

Our claim reserve development experience is 

similar to the MCCA with reported and pending claims 
increasing in recent years.  Moreover, the MCCA has 
reported severity increasing with nearly 60% of 
reimbursements for attendant and residential care 
services.  Michigan’s unique no-fault motor vehicle 
insurance law provides unlimited lifetime coverage for 
medical expenses resulting from motor vehicle 
accidents.  The reserve increases in the MCCA program 
are attributable to an increased recognition of longer 
term paid loss trends.  The paid loss trends are rising 
due to increased costs in medical and attendant care 
and increased longevity of claimants.  As a result of 
continuing to originate motor vehicle policies in 
Michigan with unlimited personal injury protection 
coverage, we expect the number of MCCA covered 
claims and losses to increase each year.

Pending MCCA claims differ from most personal 

lines insurance pending claims as other personal lines 
policies have coverage limits and incurred claims settle 
in shorter periods.  Claims are considered pending as 

long as payments are continuing pursuant to an 
outstanding MCCA claim, which can be for a claimant’s 
lifetime.  Claims that occurred more than five years ago 
and continue to be paid often reflect lifetime benefits.

As of December 31, 2017, approximately 1,440 of 
our pending claims have been reported to the MCCA, 
of which approximately 60% represents claims that 
occurred more than 5 years ago.  There are 70 Allstate 
brand claims with reserves in excess of $15 million as of 
December 31, 2017, which comprise approximately 35% 
of the gross ending reserves in the table above.  As a 
result, significant developments with a single claimant 
can result in volatility in prior year incurred claims.  

Reinsurance recoverable on paid and unpaid 

claims including IBNR as of December 31, 2017 and 
2016 includes $5.26 billion and $4.95 billion, 
respectively, from the MCCA.

We enter into certain intercompany insurance and 

reinsurance transactions in order to maintain 
underwriting control and manage insurance risk among 
various legal entities.  These reinsurance agreements 
have been approved by the appropriate regulatory 
authorities.  All significant intercompany transactions 
have been eliminated in consolidation.

Catastrophe reinsurance  Our catastrophe 

reinsurance program is designed, utilizing our risk 
management methodology, to address our exposure to 
catastrophes nationwide.  Our program is designed to 
provide reinsurance protection for catastrophes 
resulting from multiple perils including hurricanes, 
windstorms, hail, tornadoes, fires following 
earthquakes, earthquakes and wildfires.  These 
reinsurance agreements are part of our catastrophe 
management strategy, which is intended to provide 
our shareholders an acceptable return on the risks 
assumed in our property business, and to reduce 
variability of earnings, while providing protection to our 
customers.

We anticipate completing the placement of our 

2018 nationwide catastrophe reinsurance program in 
the second quarter of 2018.  We expect the program 
will be similar to our 2017 nationwide catastrophe 
reinsurance program.  For further details of the existing 
2017 program, see Note 10 of the consolidated financial 
statements.

Adjusted net income was $247 million in 2016 

compared to $239 million in 2015.  The increase was 
primarily due to higher premiums and contract 
charges, partially offset by higher operating costs and 
expenses.

Premiums and contract charges increased 2.4% or 

$30 million in 2017 compared to 2016.  The increase 
primarily relates to higher traditional life insurance 
renewal premiums as well as lower levels of 
reinsurance premiums ceded.  Approximately 85% of 
Allstate Life’s traditional life insurance premium relates 
to term life insurance products.

respectively.

Contract benefits increased 3.1% or $23 million in 

2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to growth in 
business in force.  Contract benefits decreased 0.9% or 
$7 million in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to 
favorable life insurance mortality experience.

Our annual review of assumptions in 2017 resulted 

in a $12 million increase in reserves, primarily for 
secondary guarantees on interest-sensitive life 
insurance due to increased projected exposure to 
benefits paid under secondary guarantees resulting 
from continued low interest rates.  In 2016, the review 
resulted in an $8 million increase in reserves primarily 
for secondary guarantees on interest-sensitive life 
insurance due to higher than anticipated retention.

Benefit spread reflects our mortality and morbidity 

results using the difference between premiums and 
contract charges earned for the cost of insurance and 
contract benefits (“benefit spread”).  Benefit spread 
increased 3.9% to $292 million in 2017 compared to 
$281 million in 2016, primarily due to growth in 
business in force.  Benefit spread increased 17.1% to 

Components of amortization of DAC

$281 million in 2016 compared to $240 million in 2015,

Investment spread reflects the difference between 

net investment income and interest credited to 
contractholder funds (“investment spread”) and is used 
to analyze the impact of net investment income and 
interest credited to contractholders on net income.  
Investment spread increased 5.1% to $207 million in 
2017 compared to $197 million in 2016 primarily due to 
higher net investment income and lower credited 
interest.  Investment spread decreased 6.6% to $197 
million in 2016 compared to $211 million in 2015, 
primarily due to lower net investment income and 
higher credited interest.

Amortization of DAC increased 2.3% or $3 million in 

2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to higher net 
realized capital gains and gross profits, partially offset 
by higher amortization deceleration for changes in

that give rise to the gain or loss and the product liability supported by the assets.  Fluctuations result from changes in the impact
of realized capital gains and losses on actual and expected gross profits.

Our annual comprehensive review of assumptions 

underlying estimated future gross profits for our 
interest-sensitive life contracts covers assumptions for 
mortality, persistency, expenses, investment returns, 
including capital gains and losses, interest crediting 
rates to policyholders, and the effect of any hedges.  

In 2017, the review resulted in a deceleration of 

DAC amortization (increase to income) of $14 million.  
DAC amortization deceleration primarily related to the 
benefit margin component of estimated gross profits 

and was due to a decrease in projected mortality.  This 
was partially offset by DAC amortization acceleration 
(decrease to income) for changes in the investment 
margin due to continued low interest rates and lower 
projected investment returns.

In 2016, the review resulted in a deceleration of 

DAC amortization of $6 million.  DAC amortization 
deceleration for changes in the investment margin was 
due to increased projected investment margins from a 
favorable asset portfolio mix.  DAC amortization

deceleration for changes in the expense margin related 
primarily to variable life insurance and was due to a 
decrease in projected expenses.

In 2015, the review resulted in an acceleration of 

DAC amortization of $1 million.

Adjusted net income was $204 million in 2017 

compared to $101 million in 2016.  The increase was 
primarily due to higher net investment income, lower 
interest credited to contractholder funds and lower 
contract benefits.  

Adjusted net income was $101 million in 2016 

compared to $166 million in 2015.  The decrease was 
primarily due to lower net investment income, partially 
offset by lower interest credited to contractholder 
funds.

Net investment income increased 10.5% or $124 

million in 2017 compared to 2016, benefiting from  
strong performance-based investment results, 
primarily from limited partnerships, partially offset by 
lower average investment balances as a result of a 
decrease in contractholder funds.  Net investment 
income decreased 10.7% or $142 million in 2016 
compared to 2015, primarily due to lower fixed income 
portfolio yields and lower average investment 
balances.  The lower fixed income yields relate to 
duration shortening in 2015 and the repositioning into 
performance-based investments and equity securities. 

The investment portfolio supporting immediate 

annuities is managed to ensure the assets match the 
characteristics of the liabilities and provide the long-
term returns needed to support this business.  To 
better match the long-term nature of our immediate 
annuities, we continue to increase performance-based 
investments in which we have ownership interests, and 
a greater proportion of return is derived from 
idiosyncratic asset or operating performance.  
Performance-based income can vary significantly 
between periods and is influenced by economic 
conditions, equity market performance, comparable 
public company earnings multiples, capitalization 
rates, operating performance of the underlying 
investments and the timing of asset sales.

Net realized capital gains in 2017 primarily relate to 

net gains on sales, as well as gains from valuation 
changes in public securities held in certain limited 
partnerships, partially offset by impairment write-
downs and derivative valuation losses.  Net realized 
capital losses in 2016 primarily related to impairment 
write-downs, partially offset by net gains on sales in 
connection with ongoing portfolio management.  Net 

Investment spread

Allstate Annuities  Segment Results 

realized capital gains in 2015 included gains on sales of 
longer duration fixed income securities in connection 
with the maturity profile shortening and equity 
securities in connection with ongoing portfolio 
management. 

Contract benefits decreased 2.0% or $12 million in 

2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to immediate 
annuity mortality experience.  Contract benefits 
increased 0.7% or $4 million in 2016 compared to 2015, 
primarily due to unfavorable immediate annuity 
mortality experience.

As of December 31, 2017, our premium deficiency 

and profits followed by losses evaluations for our 
immediate annuities with life contingencies concluded 
that no adjustments were required to be recognized.  
For further detail on these evaluations, see Reserve for 
life-contingent contract benefits estimation in the 
Application of Critical Accounting Estimates section.

Benefit spread reflects our mortality results using 
the difference between contract charges earned and 
contract benefits excluding the portion related to the 
implied interest on immediate annuities with life 
contingencies.  This implied interest totaled $501 
million, $511 million and $514 million in 2017, 2016 and 
2015, respectively.  Total benefit spread was $(84) 
million, $(86) million and $(80) million in 2017, 2016 and 
2015, respectively. 

Interest credited to contractholder funds 

decreased 7.9% or $32 million in 2017 compared to 2016 
and decreased 8.6% or $38 million in 2016 compared to 
2015, primarily due to lower average contractholder 
funds.  Valuation changes on derivatives embedded in 
equity-indexed annuity contracts that are not hedged 
increased interest credited to contractholder funds by 
$1 million in 2017 compared to $3 million in 2016 and $2 
million in 2015.

Investment spread reflects the difference between 

net investment income and the sum of interest 
credited to contractholder funds and the implied 
interest on immediate annuities with life contingencies, 
which is included as a component of contract benefits 
and is used to analyze the impact of net investment 
income and interest credited to contractholders on net 
income.

To further analyze investment spreads, the following table summarizes the weighted average investment yield on 

assets supporting product liabilities, interest crediting rates and investment spreads.  Investment spreads may vary 
significantly between periods due to the variability in investment income, particularly for immediate fixed annuities

crediting rate, subject to a contractual minimum.  Other products, including equity-indexed, variable and immediate 
annuities totaling $4.66 billion of contractholder funds, have been excluded from the analysis because management 
does not have the ability to change the crediting rate or the minimum crediting rate is not considered meaningful in 
this context.

Contractholder funds represent interest-bearing liabilities arising from the sale of products such as fixed annuities 

and funding agreements.  The balance of contractholder funds is equal to the cumulative deposits received and 
interest credited to the contractholder less cumulative contract benefits, surrenders, withdrawals, maturities and 
contract charges for mortality or administrative expenses.

Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.  The table above is intended to supplement our discussion and analysis of 
revenues, which are presented net of reinsurance on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  As a result, the net change in 
contractholder funds associated with products reinsured is reflected as a component of the other adjustments line.

Contractholder funds decreased 8.2% and 8.8% in 

2017 and 2016, respectively, primarily due to the 
continued runoff of our deferred fixed annuity 
business.  We discontinued the sale of annuities but 
still accept additional deposits on existing contracts.

Contractholder deposits decreased 33.3% in 2017 

compared to 2016, primarily due to lower additional 
deposits on fixed annuities.  Contractholder deposits in 
2016 were comparable to 2015.

Surrenders and partial withdrawals decreased 7.3% 

to $723 million in 2017 from $780 million in 2016.  

Allstate Annuities reinsurance ceded  

We ceded substantially all of the risk associated 

with our variable annuity business to Prudential 
Insurance Company of America (“Prudential”).  Our 
reinsurance recoverables from Prudential totaled $1.35 
billion and $1.41 billion as of December 31, 2017 and 
2016, respectively.  We also have reinsurance 
recoverables from other reinsurers of $17 million and 
$18 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, 
respectively.

Surrenders and partial withdrawals decreased 22.2% to 
$780 million in 2016 from $1.00 billion in 2015.  The 
surrender and partial withdrawal rate on deferred fixed 
annuities, based on the beginning of year 
contractholder funds, was 8.7% in 2017 compared to 
8.6% in 2016 and 9.9% in 2015.

Maturities of and interest payments on 

institutional products included an $85 million maturity 
in 2016.  There were no institutional products 
outstanding as of December 31, 2017 or 2016.

We retain primary liability as a direct insurer for all 
risks ceded to reinsurers.  We continuously monitor the 
creditworthiness of reinsurers in order to determine 
our risk of recoverability on an individual and 
aggregate basis, and a provision for uncollectible 
reinsurance is recorded if needed.  No amounts have 
been deemed unrecoverable in the three-years ended 
December 31, 2017.

Overview and strategy  The return on our

investment portfolios is an important component of 
our ability to offer good value to customers, fund 
business improvements and create value for 
shareholders.  Investment portfolios are held for 
Property-Liability, Service Businesses, Allstate Life, 
Allstate Benefits, Allstate Annuities, and Corporate and 
Other operations.  While taking into consideration the 
investment portfolio in aggregate, management of the 
underlying portfolios is significantly influenced by the 
nature of each respective business and its 
corresponding liability profile.  For each operation, we 
identify a strategic asset allocation which considers 
both the nature of the liabilities and the risk and return 
characteristics of the various asset classes in which we 
invest.  This allocation is informed by our long-term 
and market expectations, as well as other 
considerations such as risk appetite, portfolio 
diversification, duration, desired liquidity and capital.  
Within appropriate ranges relative to strategic 
allocations, tactical allocations are made in 
consideration of prevailing and potential future market 
conditions.  We manage risks that involve uncertainty 
related to interest rates, credit spreads, equity returns 
and currency exchange rates. 

The Property-Liability portfolio emphasizes 

protection of principal and consistent income 
generation, within a total return framework.  This 
approach has produced competitive returns over the 
long term and is designed to ensure financial strength 
and stability for paying claims, while maximizing 
economic value and surplus growth.  Products with 
lower liquidity needs, such as auto insurance and 
discontinued lines and coverages, and capital create 
capacity to invest in less liquid higher yielding fixed 
income securities, performance-based investments 
such as limited partnerships, and equity securities.  
Products with higher liquidity needs, such as 
homeowners insurance, are invested primarily in high 
quality liquid fixed income securities.

The Service Businesses portfolio is focused on 

protection of principal and consistent income 
generation, within a total return framework.  The 
portfolio is largely comprised of fixed income securities 
with a lesser allocation to equity securities and short-
term investments.

The Allstate Life portfolio is comprised of assets 

chosen to generate returns to support corresponding 
liabilities within an asset-liability framework that 
targets an appropriate return on capital.  This portfolio 
is well diversified and primarily consists of longer 
duration fixed income securities and commercial 
mortgage loans.

The Allstate Benefits portfolio is focused on 
generating an appropriate return on capital.  The 
portfolio is largely comprised of fixed income securities 
and commercial mortgage loans with a small allocation 
to equity securities.

The Allstate Annuities portfolio is managed to 
ensure the assets match the characteristics of the 
liabilities.  For longer-term immediate annuity liabilities, 
we invest primarily in performance-based investments 
such as limited partnerships and equity securities.  For 
shorter-term annuity liabilities, we invest primarily in 
fixed income securities and commercial mortgage 
loans with maturity profiles aligned with liability cash 
flow requirements.

The Corporate and Other portfolio balances 

liquidity needs related to the corporate capital 
structure with the pursuit of returns.

Within each segment, we utilize two primary 

strategies to manage risks and returns and to position 
our portfolio to take advantage of market 
opportunities while attempting to mitigate adverse 
effects.  As strategies and market conditions evolve, 
the asset allocation may change or assets may be 
moved between strategies.

Market-based strategies include investments 

primarily in public fixed income and equity securities.  
Market-based core seeks to deliver predictable 
earnings aligned to business needs and returns 
consistent with the markets in which we invest.  Private 
fixed income assets, such as commercial mortgages, 
bank loans and privately placed debt that provide 
liquidity premiums are also included in this category.  
Market-based active seeks to outperform within the 
public markets through tactical positioning and by 
taking advantage of short-term opportunities.  This 
category may generate results that meaningfully 
deviate from those achieved by market indices, both 
favorably and unfavorably. 

Performance-based strategy seeks to deliver 
attractive risk-adjusted returns and supplement 
market risk with idiosyncratic risk.  Returns are 
impacted by a variety of factors including general 
macroeconomic and public market conditions as public 
benchmarks are often used in the valuation of 
underlying investments.  Variability in earnings will also 
result from the performance of the underlying assets or 
business and the timing of sales of those investments.  
Earnings from the sales of investments may be 
recorded as net investment income or realized capital 
gains and losses.  The portfolio, which primarily 
includes private equity and real estate with a majority 
being limited partnerships, is diversified across a 
number of characteristics, including managers or 

partners, vintage years, strategies, geographies 
(including international) and industry sectors or 
property types.  These investments are generally 
illiquid in nature, often require specialized expertise, 
typically involve a third party manager, and often 
enhance returns and income through transformation at 
the company or property level.  A portion of these 
investments seek returns in markets or asset classes 
that are dislocated or special situations, primarily in 
private markets.

Outlook 

In December 2017, the Federal Open Market 

Committee (“FOMC”) tightened monetary policy by 
setting the new target range for the federal funds rate 
at 1-1/4 percent to 1-1/2 percent and maintained their 
inflation target of 2 percent.  The FOMC noted that 
monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby 
supporting strong labor market conditions and a return 
to 2 percent inflation.  The path of the federal funds 
rate increase will depend on economic conditions and 
their impact on the economic outlook.  We anticipate 
that interest rates will continue to increase but remain 
below historical averages and that financial markets 
may continue to have periods of high volatility and less 
liquidity.  We plan to focus on the following priorities:

Investments  Key Results and Updates

•  Enhance investment portfolio returns through 

dynamic asset allocation and tax efficiency.

•  Leverage our broad capabilities to shift the 

portfolio mix to earn higher risk-adjusted returns 
on capital.

• 

Invest for the specific needs and characteristics of 
Allstate’s businesses, including its corresponding 
liability profile.

We continue to increase performance-based 
investments in our portfolios, consistent with our 
ongoing strategy to have a greater proportion of return 
derived from idiosyncratic asset or operating 
performance.  

Invested assets and market-based income are 

expected to decline in line with reductions in 
contractholder funds and income related to 
performance-based investments will result in variability 
of earnings for the Allstate Annuities segment.  
Additionally, investment income may decline to the 
extent we reinvest investment proceeds at market 
yields that are below the current portfolio yield.

During 2017, strategic actions focused on 

optimizing portfolio yield, return and risk in the low 
interest rate environment.  

 We continued to increase performance-based 

investments in both the Property-Liability and Allstate 
Annuities portfolios.  

We maintained the maturity profile of our fixed 

income securities at a duration of 3.3, 5.7 and 4.1 years 
for the Property-Liability, Allstate Life and Allstate 
Annuities portfolios, respectively.  These actions have 
reduced our exposure to rising rates.

while shorter-term annuity liabilities will be invested in 
market-based investments.

Fixed income securities are rated by third party 

credit rating agencies and/or are internally rated.  As of 
December 31, 2017, 87.2% of the consolidated fixed 
income securities portfolio was rated investment 
grade, which is defined as a security having a rating of 
Aaa, Aa, A or Baa from Moody’s, a rating of AAA, AA, A 
or BBB from S&P, a comparable rating from another 
nationally recognized rating agency, or a comparable 
internal rating if an externally provided rating is not 
available.  Credit ratings below these designations are 

considered low credit quality or below investment 
grade, which includes high yield bonds.  Market prices 
for certain securities may have credit spreads which 
imply higher or lower credit quality than the current 
third party rating.  Our initial investment decisions and 
ongoing monitoring procedures for fixed income 
securities are based on a thorough due diligence 
process which includes, but is not limited to, an 
assessment of the credit quality, sector, structure, and 
liquidity risks of each issue.

Municipal bonds, including tax exempt and taxable 
securities, totaled $8.33 billion as of December 31, 2017 
with 99.1% rated investment grade and an unrealized 
net capital gain of $275 million.  The municipal bond 
portfolio includes general obligations of state and local 
issuers and revenue bonds (including pre-refunded 
bonds, which are bonds for which an irrevocable trust 
has been established to fund the remaining payments 
of principal and interest).

Our practice for acquiring and monitoring 

municipal bonds is predominantly based on the 
underlying credit quality of the primary obligor.  We 
currently rely on the primary obligor to pay all 
contractual cash flows and are not relying on bond 
insurers for payments.  As a result of downgrades in 
the insurers’ credit ratings, the ratings of the insured 
municipal bonds generally reflect the underlying 
ratings of the primary obligor.

Corporate bonds, including publicly traded and 

privately placed, totaled $44.03 billion as of 
December 31, 2017, with an unrealized net capital gain 
of $1.03 billion.  Privately placed securities primarily 
consist of corporate issued senior debt securities that 
are directly negotiated with the borrower or are in 
unregistered form.

Our $11.96 billion portfolio of privately placed 

securities is diversified by issuer, industry sector and 
country.  The portfolio is made up of 449 issuers.  
Privately placed corporate obligations may contain 
structural security features such as financial covenants 
and call protections that provide investors greater 
protection against credit deterioration, reinvestment 
risk or fluctuations in interest rates than those typically 
found in publicly registered debt securities.  
Additionally, investments in these securities are made 
after due diligence of the issuer, typically including 

discussions with senior management and on-site visits 
to company facilities.  Ongoing monitoring includes 
direct periodic dialog with senior management of the 
issuer and continuous monitoring of operating 
performance and financial position.  Every issue not 
rated by an independent rating agency is internally 
rated with a formal rating affirmation at least once a 
year.

Our corporate bonds portfolio includes $6.92 billion 
of below investment grade bonds, $2.73 billion of which 
are privately placed.  These securities are diversified by 
issuer and industry sector.  The below investment 
grade corporate bonds portfolio is made up of 294 
issuers.  We employ fundamental analyses of issuers 
and sectors along with macro and asset class views to 
identify investment opportunities.  This results in a 
portfolio with broad exposure to the high yield market, 
yet with an emphasis on idiosyncratic positions 
reflective of our views of market conditions and 
opportunities.

Foreign government securities totaled $1.02 billion 
as of December 31, 2017, with 100.0% rated investment 
grade and an unrealized net capital gain of $16 million.  
Of these securities, 73.6% are in Canadian 
governmental and provincial securities (68.8% of which 
are held by our Canadian companies), 18.8% are backed 
by the U.S. government and the remaining 7.6% are 
highly diversified in other foreign governments.

ABS, RMBS and CMBS are structured securities 

that are primarily collateralized by consumer or 
corporate borrowings and residential and commercial 
real estate loans.  The cash flows from the underlying 
collateral paid to the securitization trust are generally 
applied in a pre-determined order and are designed so 
that each security issued by the trust, typically referred 
to as a “class”, qualifies for a specific original rating.  

2017 Annual Report  157
2017 Annual Report  157

Key Results and Updates  Investments

For example, the “senior” portion or “top” of the capital 
structure, or rating class, which would originally qualify 
for a rating of Aaa typically has priority in receiving 
principal repayments on the underlying collateral and 
retains this priority until the class is paid in full.  In a 
sequential structure, underlying collateral principal 
repayments are directed to the most senior rated Aaa 
class in the structure until paid in full, after which 
principal repayments are directed to the next most 
senior Aaa class in the structure until it is paid in full.  
Senior Aaa classes generally share any losses from the 
underlying collateral on a pro-rata basis after losses 
are absorbed by classes with lower original ratings.  
The payment priority and class subordination included 
in these securities serves as credit enhancement for 
holders of the senior or top portions of the structures.  
These securities continue to retain the payment 
priority features that existed at the origination of the 
securitization trust.  Other forms of credit 
enhancement may include structural features 
embedded in the securitization trust, such as 
overcollateralization, excess spread and bond 
insurance.  The underlying collateral may contain fixed 
interest rates, variable interest rates (such as 
adjustable rate mortgages), or both fixed and variable 
rate features.

ABS, including CDO and Consumer and other ABS, 
totaled $1.27 billion as of December 31, 2017, with 96.5% 
rated investment grade and an unrealized net capital 
gain of $6 million.  Credit risk is managed by 
monitoring the performance of the underlying 
collateral.  Many of the securities in the ABS portfolio 
have credit enhancement with features such as 
overcollateralization, subordinated structures, reserve 
funds, guarantees and/or insurance.

CDO totaled $579 million as of December 31, 2017, 

with 93.1% rated investment grade and an unrealized 
net capital gain of $7 million.  CDO consist of 
obligations collateralized by cash flow CDO, which are 
structures collateralized primarily by below investment 
grade senior secured corporate loans.

Consumer and other ABS totaled $693 million as of 
December 31, 2017, with 99.3% rated investment grade.  
Consumer and other ABS consists of $273 million of 
consumer auto, $175 million of credit card and $245 
million of other ABS with unrealized net capital losses 

of $1 million, $1 million and an unrealized net capital 
gain of $1 million, respectively.

RMBS totaled $578 million as of December 31, 

2017, with 23.0% rated investment grade and an 
unrealized net capital gain of $98 million.  The RMBS 
portfolio is subject to interest rate risk, but unlike other 
fixed income securities, is additionally subject to 
prepayment risk from the underlying residential 
mortgage loans.  RMBS consists of a U.S. Agency 
portfolio having collateral issued or guaranteed by U.S. 
government agencies and a non-agency portfolio 
consisting of securities collateralized by Prime, Alt-A 
and Subprime loans.  The non-agency portfolio totaled 
$475 million as of December 31, 2017, with 6.3% rated 
investment grade and an unrealized net capital gain of 
$96 million.

CMBS totaled $128 million as of December 31, 2017, 

with 35.9% rated investment grade and an unrealized 
net capital gain of $4 million.  The CMBS portfolio is 
subject to credit risk and has a sequential pay-down 
structure.  The CMBS investments are primarily 
traditional conduit transactions collateralized by 
commercial mortgage loans, broadly diversified across 
property types and geographical area. 

Equity securities primarily include common 
stocks, exchange traded and mutual funds, non-
redeemable preferred stocks and real estate 
investment trust equity investments.  Certain 
exchange traded and mutual funds have fixed income 
securities as their underlying investments.  The equity 
securities portfolio was $6.62 billion as of December 31, 
2017, with an unrealized net capital gain of $1.16 billion. 

Mortgage loans, which are primarily held in the life 

and annuity portfolios, totaled $4.53 billion as of 
December 31, 2017 and primarily comprise loans 
secured by first mortgages on developed commercial 
real estate.  Key considerations used to manage our 
exposure include property type and geographic 
diversification.  For further detail on our mortgage loan 
portfolio, see Note 5 of the consolidated financial 
statements.

Limited partnership interests include interests in 
private equity funds, real estate funds and other funds.

(2)  Total EMA includes approximately $854 million of cumulative pre-tax appreciation.  EMA limited partnerships are included in our

comprehensive portfolio monitoring process to identify other-than-temporary impairment.  Evidence of a loss in value that is
other-than-temporary may include the absence of an ability to recover the carrying amount of the investment or the inability of
the investee to sustain a level of earnings that would justify the carrying amount of the investment.

Short-term investments totaled $1.94 billion as of 

December 31, 2017, which includes securities lending 
collateral of $808 million. 

Other investments primarily comprise $1.70 billion 
of bank loans, $905 million of policy loans, $538 million 
of agent loans (loans issued to exclusive Allstate 
agents), $468 million of real estate and $127 million of 
derivatives as of December 31, 2017.  For further detail

Unrealized net capital gains and losses

Unrealized net capital gains totaled $2.63 billion 

as of December 31, 2017 compared to $1.77 billion as of 
December 31, 2016.  The appreciation of equity 
securities reflected strong equity markets, partially 
offset by realization of gains from the sale of securities.  
Fixed income valuations increased on lower market 
yields resulting from tighter credit spreads, partially 
offset by realization of gains from the sale of securities.

existing unrealized net capital gains and losses, after-tax, will be reclassified to retained income through a cumulative-effect
adjustment.   See Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements for additional details on the new accounting standard.

We have a comprehensive portfolio monitoring 

process to identify and evaluate each fixed income and 
equity security that may be other-than-temporarily 
impaired.  The process includes a quarterly review of all 
securities to identify instances where the fair value of a 
security compared to its amortized cost (for fixed 
income securities) or cost (for equity securities) is 
below established thresholds.  The process also 
includes the monitoring of other impairment indicators 
such as ratings, ratings downgrades and payment 

defaults.  The securities identified, in addition to other 
securities for which we may have a concern, are 
evaluated for potential other-than-temporary 
impairment using all reasonably available information 
relevant to the collectability or recovery of the security.  
Inherent in our evaluation of other-than-temporary 
impairment for these fixed income and equity 
securities are assumptions and estimates about the 
financial condition and future earnings potential of the 
issue or issuer.  Some of the factors that may be 

2017 Annual Report  159

considered in evaluating whether a decline in fair value 
is other than temporary are: 1) the financial condition, 
near-term and long-term prospects of the issue or 
issuer, including relevant industry specific market 
conditions and trends, geographic location and 
implications of rating agency actions and offering 
prices; 2) the specific reasons that a security is in an 
unrealized loss position, including overall market 
conditions which could affect liquidity; and 3) the 
length of time and extent to which the fair value has 
been less than amortized cost or cost.  All investments 
in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2017 

were included in our portfolio monitoring process for 
determining whether declines in value were other than 
temporary.

The unrealized net capital gain for the fixed income 
portfolio totaled $1.47 billion, comprised of $1.75 billion 
of gross unrealized gains and $283 million of gross 
unrealized losses as of December 31, 2017.  This is 
compared to an unrealized net capital gain for the fixed 
income portfolio totaling $1.26 billion, comprised of 
$1.71 billion of gross unrealized gains and $447 million 
of gross unrealized losses as of December 31, 2016.

The consumer goods, utilities and capital goods 

sectors comprise 31%, 14% and 11%, respectively, of the 
carrying value of our corporate fixed income securities 
portfolio as of December 31, 2017.  The consumer 
goods, utilities and banking sectors had the highest 
concentration of gross unrealized losses in our 
corporate fixed income securities portfolio as of 
December 31, 2017.  In general, the gross unrealized 
losses are related to an increase in market yields, 
which may include increased risk-free interest rates 
and/or wider credit spreads since the time of initial 
purchase.  Similarly, gross unrealized gains reflect a 

decrease in market yields since the time of initial 
purchase.

The unrealized net capital gain for the equity 

portfolio totaled $1.16 billion, comprised of $1.17 billion 
of gross unrealized gains and $12 million of gross 
unrealized losses as of December 31, 2017.  This is 
compared to an unrealized net capital gain for the 
equity portfolio totaling $509 million, comprised of 
$594 million of gross unrealized gains and $85 million 
of gross unrealized losses as of December 31, 2016.

As of December 31, 2017, we have not made the decision to sell and it is not more likely than not we will be required 

to sell fixed income securities with unrealized losses before recovery of the amortized cost basis.  

As of December 31, 2017, we have the intent and ability to hold equity securities with unrealized losses for a period 

of time sufficient for them to recover.

respectively.  Investee level expenses include depreciation and asset level operating expenses on directly held real estate and

Net investment income increased 11.8% or $359 

million in 2017 compared to 2016, after decreasing 3.6% 
or $114 million in 2016 compared to 2015.  The 2017 
increase benefited from strong performance-based 
results, primarily from limited partnerships, an increase 
in invested assets and stable market-based yields, 
partially offset by higher employee-related expenses.  

The 2016 decrease was primarily due to lower fixed 
income yields resulting from lower market yields and 
portfolio repositioning (including both the 2015 
maturity profile shortening in the portfolio supporting 
annuity liabilities and the shift to performance-based 
investments).

consolidated investments.

Performance-based investment income increased 
55.8% or $341 million in 2017 compared to an increase 
of 2.2% or $13 million in 2016.  The increase reflects 
asset appreciation, sales of underlying investments, 
and the continued growth of our performance-based 
portfolio.  

The five highest contributing performance-based 

investments in 2017 and 2016 generated investment 

income of $210 million and $147 million, respectively. 
Performance-based results and income can vary 
significantly between periods and are influenced by  
economic conditions, equity market performance, 
comparable public company earnings multiples, 
capitalization rates, operating performance of the 
underlying investments and the timing of asset sales.

Realized capital gains and losses in 2017 primarily 

related to net gains on sales, as well as gains from 
valuation changes in public securities held in certain 
limited partnerships, partially offset by impairment and 
change in intent write-downs, and derivative valuation 
losses.

Impairment write-downs totaled $102 million, $234 

million and $195 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, 
respectively.  

Equity securities were written down in 2017, 2016 

and 2015 primarily due to the length of time and extent 
to which fair value was below cost, considering our 
assessment of the financial condition and prospects of 
the issuer, including relevant industry conditions and 
trends.  

Impairment write-downs on limited partnership 

interests and fixed income securities in 2017 related to 
investment specific circumstances.

Impairment write-downs on fixed income securities 
in 2016 were primarily driven by corporate fixed income 
securities impacted by issuer specific circumstances.  
Limited partnership write-downs primarily related to 
investments with exposure to the energy sector, 
partially offset by the recovery in value of a limited 
partnership that was previously written-down.  
Impairment write-downs in 2016 included $108 million 
related to investments with exposure to the energy 
sector.

Impairment write-downs on fixed income securities 
in 2015 were primarily driven by corporate fixed income 
securities impacted by issuer specific circumstances 
including exposure to oil and natural gas, defaulted 
special assessment municipal bonds, and collateralized 
loan obligations that experienced deterioration in 
expected cash flows.  Limited partnership write-downs 
primarily related to two investments that had been 
impacted by the decline in natural gas prices.  
Impairment write-downs in 2015 included $97 million 
and $18 million of investments with exposure to the 
energy sector and metals and mining exposure in the 
basic industry sector, respectively.

Change in intent write-downs totaled $48 million, 

$69 million and $221 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, 
respectively.  The change in intent write-downs 
primarily relate to equity securities that we may not

hold for a period of time sufficient to recover 
unrealized losses given our preference to maintain 
flexibility to reposition the portfolio.  As of December 
31, 2017, these holdings totaled $2.03 billion.  For 
certain equity securities managed by third parties, we 
do not retain decision making authority as it pertains 
to selling securities that are in an unrealized loss 
position and therefore we recognize any unrealized 
loss at the end of the period through a charge to 
earnings.  As of December 31, 2017, these holdings 
totaled $58 million and we recognized change in intent 
write-downs of $1 million in 2017.

Sales and other generated $641 million, $213 

million and $470 million of net realized capital gains in 
2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Sales and other in 2017 and 2016 included sales of 
equity and fixed income securities in connection with 
ongoing portfolio management, as well as gains from 
valuation changes in public securities held in certain 
limited partnerships.  Sales in first quarter 2016 
included $105 million of losses on $1.90 billion of sales 
to reduce our exposure to the energy, metals and 
mining sectors.  Sales and other in 2015 included sales 
of longer duration fixed income securities in 
connection with the maturity profile shortening in the 
portfolio supporting annuity liabilities and equity 
securities in connection with ongoing portfolio 
management, as well as losses from valuation changes 
in public securities held in certain limited partnerships. 

Valuation and settlements of derivative instruments 
net realized capital losses were $46 million in 2017, net 
realized capital gains netted to zero in 2016 and net 
realized capital losses were $24 million in 2015.  2017 
primarily comprised losses on foreign currency 
contracts due to the weakening of the U.S. Dollar and 
losses on equity futures used for risk management due 
to increases in equity indices.  2016 primarily 
comprised gains on foreign currency contracts due to 
the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar, offset by losses on 
equity futures used for risk management due to 
increases in equity indices and losses on credit default 
swaps due to the tightening of credit spreads on the 
underlying credit names.  The net realized capital 
losses in 2015 primarily comprised losses on foreign 
currency contracts due to the weakening of the 
Canadian dollar.

Market Risk

Market risk is the risk that we will incur losses due 

to adverse changes in interest rates, credit spreads, 
equity prices, commodity prices or currency exchange 
rates.  Adverse changes to these rates and prices may 
occur due to changes in fiscal policy, the economic 
climate, the liquidity of a market or market segment, 
insolvency or financial distress of key market makers or 
participants or changes in market perceptions of credit 
worthiness and/or risk tolerance.  Our primary market 
risk exposures are to changes in interest rates, credit 
spreads and equity prices.  We have no direct exposure 
to commodity price changes.

The active management of market risk is integral 
to our results of operations.  We may use the following 
approaches to manage exposure to market risk within 
defined tolerance ranges: 1) rebalancing existing asset 
or liability portfolios, 2) changing the type of 
investments purchased in the future and 3) using 
derivative instruments to modify the market risk 
characteristics of existing assets and liabilities or 
assets expected to be purchased.  For a more detailed 
discussion of our use of derivative instruments, see 
Note 7 of the consolidated financial statements.

Overview  In formulating and implementing 

guidelines for investing funds, we seek to earn 
attractive risk-adjusted returns that enhance our ability 
to offer competitive rates and prices to customers 
while contributing to stable profits and long-term 
capital growth.  Accordingly, our investment decisions 
and objectives are informed by the underlying risks 
and product profiles.  Investment policies define the 
overall framework for managing market and other 
investment risks, including accountability and controls 
over risk management activities.  Subsidiaries that 
conduct investment activities follow policies that have 
been approved by their respective boards of directors 
and which specify the investment limits and strategies 
that are appropriate given the liquidity, surplus, 
product profile and regulatory requirements of the 
subsidiary.  Executive oversight of investment activities 
is conducted primarily through subsidiaries’ boards of 
directors and investment committees.  

For life and annuity products, the asset-liability 

management (“ALM”) policies further define the overall 
framework for managing market and investment risks 
and are approved by the subsidiaries’ respective 
boards of directors.  ALM focuses on strategies to 
enhance yields, mitigate market risks and optimize 
capital to improve profitability and returns while 
incorporating future expected cash requirements to 
repay liabilities.  These ALM policies specify limits, 
ranges and/or targets for investments that best meet 
business objectives in light of the unique demands and 
characteristics of the product liabilities and are 
intended to result in a prudent, methodical and 
effective adjudication of market risk and return.

We use widely-accepted quantitative and 

qualitative approaches to measure, monitor and 
manage market risk.  We evaluate our market risk 
exposure using multiple measures including but not 
limited to:  

Market Risk  Key Results and Updates

• Duration, a measure of the price sensitivity of assets

and liabilities to changes in interest rates

• Value-at-risk, a statistical estimate of the probability

that the change in fair value of a portfolio will exceed a
certain amount over a given time horizon

• Scenario analysis, an estimate of the potential changes

in the fair value of a portfolio that could occur under
hypothetical market conditions defined by changes to
multiple market risk factors: interest rates, credit
spreads, equity prices or currency exchange rates

• Sensitivity analysis, an estimate of the potential

changes in the fair value of a portfolio that could occur
using hypothetical shocks to a market risk factor

  In general, we establish investment portfolio 

asset allocation and market risk limits based upon a 
combination of duration, value-at-risk, scenario 
analysis and sensitivity analysis.  The asset allocation 
limits place restrictions on the total funds that may be 
invested within an asset class.  Comprehensive day-to-
day management of market risk within defined 
tolerance ranges occurs as portfolio managers buy and 
sell within their respective markets based upon the 
acceptable boundaries established by investment 
policies.  Although we apply a similar overall philosophy 
to market risk, the underlying business frameworks 
and the accounting and regulatory environments may 
differ between our products and therefore affect 
investment decisions and risk parameters.

Interest rate risk is the risk that we will incur a 

loss due to adverse changes in interest rates relative to 
the characteristics of our interest-bearing assets and 
liabilities.  Interest rate risk includes risks related to 
changes in U.S. Treasury yields and other key risk-free 
reference yields.  This risk arises from many of our 
primary activities, as we invest substantial funds in 
interest-sensitive assets and issue interest-sensitive 
liabilities.  Changes in interest rates can have favorable 
and unfavorable effects on our results.  For example, 
increases in rates can improve investment income, but 
decrease the fair value of our fixed income securities 
portfolio and increase policyholder surrenders 
requiring us to liquidate assets.  Decreases in rates 
could increase the fair value of our fixed income 
securities portfolio while decreasing investment 
income due to reinvesting at lower market yields and 
accelerating pay-downs and prepayments of certain 
investments.  

 For our corporate debt, we monitor market 

interest rates and evaluate refinancing opportunities 
as maturity dates approach.  To mitigate this risk, we 
structure the maturity dates of our debt.  For further 
detail regarding our debt, see Note 12 of the 
consolidated financial statements and the Capital 
Resources and Liquidity section of the MD&A.

We manage the interest rate risk in our assets 

relative to the interest rate risk in our liabilities and our 
assessment of overall economic and capital risk.  One 
of the measures used to quantify this exposure is 
duration.  The difference in the duration of our assets 
relative to our liabilities is our duration gap.  To 
calculate the duration gap between assets and 

2017 Annual Report  165
2017 Annual Report  165

Key Results and Updates  Market Risk

liabilities, we project asset and liability cash flows and 
calculate their net present value using a risk-free 
market interest rate adjusted for credit quality, sector 
attributes, liquidity and other specific risks.  Duration is 
calculated by revaluing these cash flows at alternative 
interest rates and determining the percentage change 
in aggregate fair value.  The cash flows used in this 
calculation include the expected maturity and repricing 
characteristics of our derivative financial instruments, 
all other financial instruments, and certain other items 
including, unearned premiums, claims and claims 
expense reserves, annuity liabilities and other interest-
sensitive liabilities.  

The projections include assumptions (based upon 
historical market experience and our experience) that 
reflect the effect of changing interest rates on the 
prepayment, lapse, leverage and/or option features of 
instruments, where applicable.  The preceding 
assumptions relate primarily to callable municipal and 
corporate bonds, fixed rate single and flexible premium 
deferred annuities, mortgage-backed securities and 
municipal housing bonds.  Additionally, the calculations 
include assumptions regarding the renewal of property 
and casualty products.

As of December 31, 2017, the difference between 

our asset and liability duration was a (2.16) gap 
compared to a (2.02) gap as of December 31, 2016.  The 
calculation excludes traditional and interest-sensitive 
life insurance and accident and health insurance 
products that are not considered financial instruments.  
A negative duration gap indicates that the fair value of 
our liabilities is more sensitive to interest rate 
movements than the fair value of our assets, while a 
positive duration gap indicates that the fair value of 
our assets is more sensitive to interest rate 
movements than the fair value of our liabilities.  Due to 
the relatively short duration of our property and 
casualty liabilities, primarily related to auto and 
homeowners claims, the investments generally 
maintain a positive duration gap between assets and 
liabilities.  In contrast, for our annuity products the 
duration gap maybe positive or negative as the assets 
and liabilities vary based on the characteristics of the 
products in-force and investing activity.  As of 
December 31, 2017, property and casualty products 
had a positive duration gap while annuity products had 
a negative duration gap. 

To reduce the risk that investment returns are 
below levels required to meet the funding needs of 
certain liabilities, we are executing our performance-
based strategy that supplements market risk with 
idiosyncratic risk.  We are using these investments, in 
addition to public equity securities, to support a 
portion of our property and casualty products and 
long-term annuity liabilities.  Shorter-term annuity 
liabilities will continue to be invested in market-based 
investments to generate cash flows that will fund 
future claims, benefits and expenses, and that will earn 
stable returns across a wide variety of interest rate and 
economic scenarios.  Performance-based investments 
and public equity securities are generally not interest-
bearing; accordingly, using them to support interest-

166  

  www.allstate.com
  www.allstate.com

bearing liabilities contributes toward a negative 
duration gap.

Based upon the information and assumptions used 
in the duration calculation, and market interest rates as 
of December 31, 2017, we estimate that a 100 basis 
point immediate, parallel increase in interest rates 
(“rate shock”) would increase the fair value of the 
assets net of liabilities by $1.65 billion, compared to an 
increase of $1.50 billion as of December 31, 2016, 
reflecting year to year changes in duration and the 
amount of assets and liabilities.  The selection of a 100 
basis point immediate, parallel change in interest rates 
should not be construed as our prediction of future 
market events, but only as an illustration of the 
potential effect of such an event.  

The estimate excludes traditional and interest-

sensitive life insurance and accident and health 
insurance products that are not considered financial 
instruments and the $11.06 billion of assets supporting 
them and the associated liabilities.  The $11.06 billion of 
assets excluded from the calculation increased from 
$10.85 billion as of December 31, 2016.  Based on 
assumptions described above, in the event of a 100 
basis point immediate increase in interest rates, the 
assets supporting the excluded products would 
decrease in value by $620 million compared to a 
decrease of $560 million as of December 31, 2016.  To 
the extent that conditions differ from the assumptions 
we used in these calculations, duration and rate shock 
measures could be significantly impacted.  Additionally, 
our calculations assume the current relationship 
between short-term and long-term interest rates (the 
term structure of interest rates) will remain constant 
over time.  As a result, these calculations may not fully 
capture the effect of non-parallel changes in the term 
structure of interest rates and/or large changes in 
interest rates.

Credit spread risk is the risk that we will incur a 

loss due to adverse changes in credit spreads 
(“spreads”).  Credit spread is the additional yield on 
fixed income securities and loans above the risk-free 
rate (typically referenced as the yield on U.S. Treasury 
securities) that market participants require to 
compensate them for assuming credit, liquidity and/or 
prepayment risks.  The magnitude of the spread will 
depend on the likelihood that a particular issuer will 
default.  This risk arises from many of our primary 
activities, as we invest substantial funds in spread-
sensitive fixed income assets.  We manage the spread 
risk in our assets.  One of the measures used to 
quantify this exposure is spread duration.  Spread 
duration measures the price sensitivity of the assets to 
changes in spreads.  For example, if spreads increase 
100 basis points, the fair value of an asset exhibiting a 
spread duration of 5 is expected to decrease in value 
by 5%.

Spread duration is calculated similarly to interest 

rate duration.  As of December 31, 2017, the spread 
duration was 3.99, compared to 3.97 as of 
December 31, 2016.  Based upon the information and 
assumptions we use in this spread duration calculation, 
and market spreads as of December 31, 2017, we 
estimate that a 100 basis point immediate, parallel 

increase in spreads across all asset classes, industry 
sectors and credit ratings (“spread shock”) would 
decrease the net fair value of the assets by $2.46 
billion compared to $2.40 billion as of December 31, 
2016.  Reflected in the spread duration calculation are 
the effects of tactical positions that include the use of 
credit default swaps to manage spread risk.  The 
selection of a 100 basis point immediate parallel 
change in spreads should not be construed as our 
prediction of future market events, but only as an 
illustration of the potential effect of such an event.

Equity price risk is the risk that we will incur losses 

due to adverse changes in the general levels of the 
equity markets.  As of December 31, 2017, we held 
$6.33 billion in common stocks and exchange traded 
and mutual funds and $7.03 billion in other 
investments with equity risk (including primarily limited 
partnership interests and non-redeemable preferred 
securities), compared to $5.48 billion and $6.00 billion, 
respectively, as of December 31, 2016.  71.1% of the 
common stocks and exchange traded and mutual 
funds and 54.8% of the other securities with equity risk 
supported property and casualty products as of 
December 31, 2017, compared to 71.3% and 53.5%, 
respectively, as of December 31, 2016.

As of December 31, 2017, our portfolio of common 

stocks and other investments with equity risk had a 
cash market portfolio beta of 1.03, compared to a beta 
of 1.04 as of December 31, 2016.  Beta represents a 
widely used methodology to describe, quantitatively, 
an investment’s market risk characteristics relative to 
an index such as the Standard & Poor’s 500 Composite 
Price Index (“S&P 500”).  Based on the beta analysis, we 
estimate that if the S&P 500 increases or decreases by 
10%, the fair value of our equity investments will 
increase or decrease by 10.3%, respectively.  Based 
upon the information and assumptions we used to 
calculate beta as of December 31, 2017, we estimate 
that an immediate increase or decrease in the S&P 500 
of 10% would increase or decrease the net fair value of 
our equity investments by $1.37 billion, of which 
approximately 50% relates to public securities, 
compared to $1.20 billion as of December 31, 2016.  The 
selection of a 10% immediate increase or decrease in 
the S&P 500 should not be construed as our prediction 
of future market events, but only as an illustration of 
the potential effect of such an event.  The beta of our 
common stocks and other investments with equity risk 
was determined by calculating the change in the fair 
value of the portfolio resulting from stressing the 
equity market up and down 10%.  The illustrations 
noted above may not reflect our actual experience if 
the future composition of the portfolio (hence its beta) 
and correlation relationships differ from the historical 
relationships.

As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had 

separate account assets related to variable annuity 
and variable life contracts with account values totaling 
$3.44 billion and $3.39 billion, respectively.  Equity risk 
exists for contract charges based on separate account 
balances and guarantees for death and/or income 
benefits provided by our variable products.  In 2006, 
we disposed of substantially all of the variable annuity 

Market Risk  Key Results and Updates

business through reinsurance agreements with The 
Prudential Insurance Company of America, a subsidiary 
of Prudential Financial Inc. and therefore mitigated this 
aspect of our risk.  Equity risk for our variable life 
business relates to contract charges and policyholder 
benefits.  Total direct and assumed variable life 
contract charges for 2017 and 2016 were $41 million 
and $40 million, respectively.  Separate account 
liabilities related to variable life contracts were $70 
million and $66 million as of December 31, 2017 and 
2016, respectively. 

As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had $1.85 

billion and $1.81 billion, respectively, in equity-indexed 
life and annuity liabilities that provide customers with 
interest crediting rates based on the performance of 
the S&P 500.  We hedge the majority of the risk 
associated with these liabilities using equity-indexed 
options and futures and eurodollar futures, maintaining 
risk within specified value-at-risk limits. 

Foreign currency exchange rate risk is the risk 

that we will incur economic losses due to adverse 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates.  This risk 
primarily arises from our foreign equity investments, 
including common stocks, limited partnership 
interests, and our Canadian, Northern Ireland and 
Indian operations.  We also have investments in certain 
fixed income securities and emerging market fixed 
income funds that are denominated in foreign 
currencies.  Derivatives are used to hedge 
approximately 4% of this foreign currency risk.

As of December 31, 2017, we had $2.18 billion in 
foreign currency denominated equity investments, 
$1.02 billion net investment in our foreign subsidiaries, 
primarily related to our Canadian operations, and $112 
million in unhedged non-U.S. dollar fixed income 
securities.  These amounts were $1.86 billion, $901 
million, and $97 million, respectively, as of 
December 31, 2016. 

Based upon the information and assumptions used 

as of December 31, 2017, we estimate that a 10% 
immediate unfavorable change in each of the foreign 
currency exchange rates to which we are exposed 
would decrease the value of our foreign currency 
denominated instruments by $326 million, compared 
with an estimated $269 million decrease as of 
December 31, 2016.  The selection of a 10% immediate 
decrease in all currency exchange rates should not be 
construed as our prediction of future market events, 
but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such 
an event.

The modeling technique we use to report our 

currency exposure does not take into account 
correlation among foreign currency exchange rates.  
Even though we believe it is very unlikely that all of the 
foreign currency exchange rates that we are exposed 
to would simultaneously decrease by 10%, we 
nonetheless stress test our portfolio under this and 
other hypothetical extreme adverse market scenarios.  
Our actual experience may differ from these results 
because of assumptions we have used or because 
significant liquidity and market events could occur that 
we did not foresee.

Key Results and Updates  Pension and Other Postretirement Plans

Pension and Other Postretirement Plans

Our defined benefit pension plans cover most full-

time employees, certain part-time employees and 
employee-agents.  Benefits are based primarily on a 
cash balance formula; however, certain participants 
have a significant portion of their benefits attributable 
to a former final average pay formula.  88% of the 
projected benefit obligation (“PBO”) of our primary 
qualified employee plan is related to the former final 
average pay formula.  See Note 17 of the consolidated 
financial statements for a discussion of these plans and 
their effect on the consolidated financial statements.

Changes in assumptions can significantly affect the 

amounts recorded for net periodic pension cost and 
AOCI, particularly the discount rate and the expected 
long-term rate of return on plan assets.  The discount 
rate is based on rates at which expected pension 
benefits attributable to past employee service could 
effectively be settled on a present value basis at the 
measurement date.  We develop the assumed discount 
rate by utilizing the weighted average yield of a 
theoretical dedicated portfolio derived from non-
callable bonds and bonds with a make-whole provision 
available in the Bloomberg corporate bond universe 
having ratings of at least “AA” by S&P or at least “Aa” 
by Moody’s on the measurement date with cash flows 
that match expected plan benefit requirements.  
Significant changes in discount rates, such as those 
caused by changes in the credit spreads, yield curve, 
the mix of bonds available in the market, the duration 
of selected bonds and expected benefit payments, 
may result in volatility in pension cost and AOCI.

Holding other assumptions constant, a 

hypothetical decrease of 100 basis points in the 
discount rate would result in an increase of $29 million, 
pre-tax, in net periodic pension cost and a $570 million, 
after-tax, increase in the unrecognized pension cost 
liability recorded as AOCI as of December 31, 2017, 
compared to an increase of $28 million, pre-tax, in net 
periodic pension cost and a $446 million, after-tax, 
increase in the unrecognized pension cost liability as of 
December 31, 2016.  A hypothetical increase of 100 
basis points in the discount rate would decrease net 
periodic pension cost by $24 million, pre-tax, and 
would decrease the unrecognized pension cost liability 
recorded as AOCI by $476 million, after-tax, as of 
December 31, 2017, compared to a decrease in net 
periodic pension cost of $25 million, pre-tax, and a 
$375 million, after-tax, decrease in the unrecognized 
pension cost liability recorded as AOCI as of December 
31, 2016.  The 2017 estimated change in the 
unrecognized pension cost liability recorded in AOCI is 
at the newly enacted 21% U.S. corporate tax rate.

This non-symmetrical range results from the non-

linear relationship between discount rates and pension 
obligations, and changes in the amortization of 
unrealized net actuarial gains and losses.

The expected long-term rate of return on plan 

assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected 
on plan assets.  While this rate reflects long-term 
assumptions and is consistent with long-term historical 
returns, sustained changes in the market or changes in 
168  
168  

  www.allstate.com
  www.allstate.com

the mix of plan assets may lead to revisions in the 
assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets that 
may result in variability of pension cost.  Differences 
between the actual return on plan assets and the 
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets are a 
component of unrecognized pension cost liability 
recorded as AOCI.

Holding other assumptions constant, a 

hypothetical decrease of 100 basis points in the 
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would 
result in an increase of $58 million, pre-tax, in net 
periodic pension cost as of December 31, 2017, 
compared to $56 million, pre-tax, as of December 31, 
2016.  A hypothetical increase of 100 basis points in the 
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would 
result in a decrease in net periodic pension cost of $58 
million, pre-tax, as of December 31, 2017, compared to 
$56 million, pre-tax, as of December 31, 2016.

Estimated 2018 net periodic pension cost is $81 

million, decreasing from $255 million in 2017, primarily 
due to lower expected settlement charges and interest 
costs and higher than expected asset returns in 2017 
and includes expected settlement charges of $27 
million primarily for lump sum payments under the 
employee-agent plan.  Pension expense is reported 
consistent with other types of employee compensation 
and as a result is included in claims expense, operating 
costs and expenses and investment expense.   

Settlement losses are likely to continue for some 

period in the future as we settle our remaining pension 
obligations from the employee-agent plan by making 
lump sum distributions.  We may incur settlement 
losses in our primary employee plan over time as a 
result of a lower threshold, continued low interest rates 
and the remaining participants of the Final Average 
Pay becoming payment eligible. 

We anticipate that the net actuarial loss for our 

pension plans will exceed 10% of the greater of the PBO 
or the market-related value of assets in 2018 and into 
the foreseeable future, resulting in additional 
amortization and net periodic pension cost.  The net 
actuarial loss for the primary qualified employee plan 
will be amortized over the remaining service life of 
active employees (approximately 10 years) or will 
reverse with increases in the discount rate or better-
than-expected returns on plan assets.

Target funding levels are established in accordance 

with applicable regulations, including those under the 
Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) for U.S. pension plans, 
and generally accepted actuarial principles.  Our 
funding levels were within our targeted range as of 
December 31, 2017.  In 2017, we contributed $131 million 
to our pension plans.  We expect to contribute $133 
million for the 2018 fiscal year.  This estimate could 
change significantly following either an improvement 
or decline in investment markets.

Shareholders’ equity increased in 2017, primarily 
due to net income, increased unrealized net capital 
gains on investments and lower unrecognized pension 
and other postretirement benefit costs, partially offset 
by common share repurchases and dividends paid to 
shareholders.  In 2017, we paid dividends of $525 
million and $116 million related to our common and 
preferred shares, respectively.  Shareholders’ equity 
increased in 2016, primarily due to net income and 
increased unrealized net capital gains on investments, 
partially offset by common share repurchases and 
dividends paid to shareholders.

Debt  $176 million of senior debt is scheduled to 
mature in May 2018 and $317 million of senior debt is 
scheduled to mature in May 2019.  We have no other 
debt maturities until June 2023.  As of December 31, 
2017 and 2016, there were no outstanding commercial 
paper borrowings.  For further information on 
outstanding debt, see Note 12 of the consolidated 
financial statements.

Common share repurchases  In August 2017, the 
Board authorized a new $2.00 billion common share 
repurchase program that is expected to be completed 
by February 2019.  As of December 31, 2017, there was 
$1.27 billion remaining on the $2.00 billion common 
share repurchase program.  In August 2017, we also 
completed the $1.50 billion common share repurchase 
program that commenced in May 2016.

On December 8, 2017, we entered into an ASR 
agreement with Morgan Stanley to purchase $300 
million of our outstanding common stock.  Under the 
ASR agreement, we paid $300 million upfront and 
initially acquired 2.5 million shares.  This ASR 
agreement settled on January 5, 2018. 

During 2017, we repurchased 15.8 million common 

shares for $1.42 billion.  The common share 
repurchases were completed through open market 
transactions and two ASR agreements. 

Since 1995, we have acquired 682 million shares of 
our common stock at a cost of $31.12 billion, primarily 
as part of various stock repurchase programs.  We 
have reissued 138 million common shares since 1995, 
primarily associated with our equity incentive plans, 
the 1999 acquisition of American Heritage Life 
Investment Corporation and the 2001 redemption of 
certain mandatorily redeemable preferred securities.  
Since 1995, total common shares outstanding has 
decreased by 544 million shares or 60.5%, primarily due 
to our repurchase programs.

Financial ratings and strength  

Senior long-term debt, commercial paper and insurance financial strength ratings

The Allstate Corporation (debt)
The Allstate Corporation (short-term issuer)
Allstate Insurance Company (insurance financial strength)
Allstate Life Insurance Company (insurance financial strength)
Allstate Assurance Company (insurance financial strength)

Our ratings are influenced by many factors 

including our operating and financial performance, 
asset quality, liquidity, asset/liability management, 
overall portfolio mix, financial leverage (i.e., debt), 
exposure to risks such as catastrophes and the current 
level of operating leverage.  The preferred stock and 
subordinated debentures are viewed as having a 
common equity component by certain rating agencies 
and are given equity credit up to a pre-determined 
limit in our capital structure as determined by their 
respective methodologies.  These respective 
methodologies consider the existence of certain terms 
and features in the instruments such as the 
noncumulative dividend feature in the preferred stock.  

In July 2017, Moody’s affirmed The Allstate 

Corporation’s debt and short-term issuer ratings of A3 
and P-2, respectively, and the insurance financial 
strength ratings of Aa3 for AIC and A1 for both Allstate 
Life Insurance Company (“ALIC”) and Allstate 
Assurance Company (“AAC”).  The outlook for the 
ratings remained stable.  In August 2017, S&P affirmed 
The Allstate Corporation’s debt and short-term issuer 
ratings of A- and A-2, respectively, and the insurance 
financial strength ratings of AA- for AIC and A+ for 
ALIC.  The outlook for the ratings remained stable.  In 
October 2017, A.M. Best affirmed The Allstate 
Corporation’s debt and short-term issuer ratings of a- 
and AMB-1, respectively, and the insurance financial 
strength ratings of A+ for AIC, ALIC and AAC.  The 
outlook for the ratings was updated to positive.

We have distinct and separately capitalized groups 

of subsidiaries licensed to sell property and casualty 
insurance that maintain separate group ratings.  The 
ratings of these groups are influenced by the risks that 
relate specifically to each group.  Many mortgage 
companies require property owners to have insurance 
from an insurance carrier with a secure financial 
strength rating from an accredited rating agency.  In 
October 2017, A.M. Best upgraded the Allstate New 
Jersey Insurance Company (“ANJ”), which writes auto 
and homeowners insurance, rating of A- to A, and 
affirmed the North Light Specialty Insurance Company 
(“North Light”), our excess and surplus lines carrier, 
rating of A+.  The outlook for the ANJ rating was stable 
while the outlook for the North Light rating was 
updated to positive.  ANJ also has a Financial Stability 
Rating® of A” from Demotech, which was affirmed in 
November 2017.  In October 2017, A.M. Best affirmed 
the CKIC, which underwrites personal lines property

Allstate’s domestic property and casualty and life 

insurance subsidiaries prepare their statutory-basis 
financial statements in conformity with accounting 
practices prescribed or permitted by the insurance 
department of the applicable state of domicile.  
Statutory surplus is a measure that is often used as a 
basis for determining dividend paying capacity, 
operating leverage and premium growth capacity, and 
it is also reviewed by rating agencies in determining 
their ratings.  Property and casualty is comprised of 29 
insurance companies, each of which has individual 
company dividend limitations.  As of December 31, 
2017, total statutory surplus is $18.63 billion compared 
to $16.82 billion as of December 31, 2016.  Property and 
casualty subsidiaries surplus was $14.90 billion as of 
December 31, 2017, compared to $13.44 billion as of 
December 31, 2016.  Life insurance subsidiaries surplus 
was $3.73 billion as of December 31, 2017, compared to 
$3.38 billion as of December 31, 2016.

The ratio of net premiums written to statutory 

surplus is a common measure of operating leverage 
used in the property and casualty insurance industry 
and serves as an indicator of a company’s premium 
growth capacity.  Ratios in excess of 3 to 1 are typically 
considered outside the usual range by insurance 
regulators and rating agencies, and for homeowners 
and related coverages that have significant net 
exposure to natural catastrophes, a ratio of 1 to 1 is 
typically within the usual range.  AIC’s combined 
premium to surplus ratio was 1.7x as of December 31, 
2017 compared to 1.9x as of December 31, 2016.

The National Association of Insurance 

Commissioners (“NAIC”) has developed financial 
relationships or tests known as the Insurance 
Regulatory Information System to assist state 
insurance regulators in monitoring the financial 
condition of insurance companies and identifying 
companies that require special attention or actions by 
state insurance regulators.  The NAIC analyzes financial 
data provided by insurance companies using 
prescribed ratios, each with defined “usual ranges”.  
Additional regulatory scrutiny may occur if a company’s 
ratios fall outside the usual ranges for four or more of 
the ratios.  Our domestic insurance companies have no 
significant departure from these ranges.

We actively manage our financial position and 

liquidity levels in light of changing market, economic, 
and business conditions.  Liquidity is managed at both 
the entity and enterprise level across the Company, 
and is assessed on both base and stressed level 
liquidity needs.  We believe we have sufficient liquidity 
to meet these needs.  Additionally, we have existing 
intercompany agreements in place that facilitate 
liquidity management across the Company to enhance 
flexibility.

As of December 31, 2017, we held $8.38 billion of 

cash, U.S. government and agencies fixed income 
securities, and public equity securities (excluding non-
redeemable preferred stocks and foreign equities) 
which, under normal market conditions, we would 
expect to be able to liquidate within one week.  In 

addition, we regularly estimate how much of the total 
portfolio, which includes high quality corporate fixed 
income and municipal holdings, can be reasonably 
liquidated within one quarter.  These estimates are 
subject to considerable uncertainty associated with 
evolving market conditions.  As of December 31, 2017, 
estimated liquidity available within one quarter without 
generating significant net realized capital losses was 
$20.99 billion.  As of December 31, 2017, gross 
unrealized losses related to fixed income and equity 
securities totaled $295 million.

Certain remote events and circumstances could 

constrain our liquidity.  Those events and 
circumstances include, for example, a catastrophe 
resulting in extraordinary losses, a downgrade in our 
senior long-term debt ratings to non-investment grade 
2017 Annual Report  171

Key Results and Updates  Capital Resources and Liquidity

status, or a downgrade in AIC’s or ALIC’s financial 
strength ratings.  The rating agencies also consider the 
interdependence of our individually rated entities; 
therefore, a rating change in one entity could 
potentially affect the ratings of other related entities.

The Allstate Corporation is party to an Amended 

and Restated Intercompany Liquidity Agreement 
(“Liquidity Agreement”) with certain subsidiaries, which 
include, but are not limited to, ALIC and AIC.  The 
Liquidity Agreement allows for short-term advances of 
funds to be made between parties for liquidity and 
other general corporate purposes.  The Liquidity 
Agreement does not establish a commitment to 
advance funds on the part of any party.  ALIC and AIC 
each serve as a lender and borrower, certain other 
subsidiaries serve only as borrowers, and the 
Corporation serves only as a lender.  AIC also has a 
capital support agreement with ALIC.  Under the 
capital support agreement, AIC is committed to 
providing capital to ALIC to maintain an adequate 
capital level.  The maximum amount of potential 
funding under each of these agreements is $1.00 billion.

In addition to the Liquidity Agreement, the 

Corporation also has an intercompany loan agreement 
with certain of its subsidiaries, which include, but are 
not limited to, AIC and ALIC.  The amount of 
intercompany loans available to the Corporation’s 
subsidiaries is at the discretion of the Corporation.  The 
maximum amount of loans the Corporation will have 
outstanding to all its eligible subsidiaries at any given 
point in time is limited to $1.00 billion.  The Corporation 
may use commercial paper borrowings, bank lines of 
credit and securities lending to fund intercompany 
borrowings.

Parent company capital capacity  At the parent 
holding company level, we have deployable assets 
totaling $1.95 billion as of December 31, 2017, 
comprising cash and investments that are generally 
saleable within one quarter.  The substantial earnings 
capacity of the operating subsidiaries is the primary 
source of capital generation for the Corporation.  In 
2018, AIC will have the capacity to pay dividends 
currently estimated at $2.87 billion without prior 
regulatory approval.  This provides funds for the parent 
company’s fixed charges and other corporate 
purposes.  In addition, we have access to $1.00 billion 
of funds from either commercial paper issuance or an 
unsecured revolving credit facility.

In 2017, AIC paid dividends totaling $1.56 billion to 

its parent, Allstate Insurance Holdings, LLC (“AIH”), 
which then paid $1.61 billion of dividends to the 
Corporation.  In 2016, AIC paid dividends totaling $1.90 
billion to AIH, which then paid $1.87 billion of dividends 
to the Corporation.  In 2015, AIC paid dividends totaling 
$2.31 billion to AIH, which then paid $2.30 billion of 
dividends to the Corporation.  In 2017, 2016 and 2015, 
ALIC paid $600 million, zero and $103 million, 
respectively, of dividends to AIC.  In 2017, 2016 and 
2015, American Heritage Life Insurance Company paid 
dividends totaling $70 million, $55 million and $80 
million, respectively, to Allstate Financial Insurance 
Holdings Corporation.  There were no capital 
172  

  www.allstate.com

contributions paid by the Corporation to AIC in 2017, 
2016 or 2015.  There were no capital contributions by 
AIC to ALIC in 2017, 2016 or 2015. 

Dividends may not be paid or declared on our 

common stock and shares of common stock may not 
be repurchased unless the full dividends for the latest 
completed dividend period on our preferred stock have 
been declared and paid or provided for.  We are 
prohibited from declaring or paying dividends on our 
preferred stock if we fail to meet specified capital 
adequacy, net income or shareholders’ equity levels, 
except out of the net proceeds of common stock 
issued during the 90 days prior to the date of 
declaration.  As of December 31, 2017, we satisfied all of 
the tests with no current restrictions on the payment 
of preferred stock dividends.

The terms of our outstanding subordinated 

debentures also prohibit us from declaring or paying 
any dividends or distributions on our common or 
preferred stock or redeeming, purchasing, acquiring, or 
making liquidation payments on our common stock or 
preferred stock if we have elected to defer interest 
payments on the subordinated debentures, subject to 
certain limited exceptions.  In 2017, we did not defer 
interest payments on the subordinated debentures.

Additional borrowings to support liquidity are as 

follows:

•  The Corporation has access to a commercial paper 

facility with a borrowing limit of $1.00 billion to 
cover short-term cash needs.  In December 2017, 
we issued $100 million of commercial paper which 
was outstanding for seven days with a weighted 
average interest rate of 1.47% and was used for 
general corporate purposes.  As of December 31, 
2017, there were no balances outstanding and 
therefore the remaining borrowing capacity was 
$1.00 billion; however, the outstanding balance can 
fluctuate daily.

•  The Corporation, AIC and ALIC have access to a 

$1.00 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that 
is available for short-term liquidity requirements.  
The maturity date of this facility is April 2021.  The 
facility is fully subscribed among 11 lenders with 
the largest commitment being $115 million.  The 
commitments of the lenders are several and no 
lender is responsible for any other lender’s 
commitment if such lender fails to make a loan 
under the facility.  This facility contains an increase 
provision that would allow up to an additional $500 
million of borrowing.  This facility has a financial 
covenant requiring that we not exceed a 37.5% 
debt to capitalization ratio as defined in the 
agreement.  This ratio was 14.9% as of December 
31, 2017.  Although the right to borrow under the 
facility is not subject to a minimum rating 
requirement, the costs of maintaining the facility 
and borrowing under it are based on the ratings of 
our senior unsecured, unguaranteed long-term 
debt.  There were no borrowings under the credit 
facility during 2017.

subsequent interest rate guarantee periods (which are typically 1, 5, 7 or 10 years) during which there is no surrender charge or

(3)  89% of these contracts have a minimum interest crediting rate guarantee of 3% or higher.
(4)  Includes $738 million of contractholder funds on variable annuities reinsured to The Prudential Insurance Company of America, a

subsidiary of Prudential Financial Inc., in 2006.

Retail life and annuity products may be 

surrendered by customers for a variety of reasons.  
Reasons unique to individual customers include a 
current or unexpected need for cash or a change in life 
insurance coverage needs.  Other key factors that may 
impact the likelihood of customer surrender include 
the level of the contract surrender charge, the length 
of time the contract has been in force, distribution 
channel, market interest rates, equity market 
conditions and potential tax implications. 

In addition, the propensity for retail life insurance 

policies to lapse is lower than it is for fixed annuities 
because of the need for the insured to be re-
underwritten upon policy replacement.  

The surrender and partial withdrawal rate on 
deferred fixed annuities and interest-sensitive life 
insurance products, based on the beginning of year 
contractholder funds, was 6.1% and 6.2% in 2017 and 
2016, respectively.  We strive to promptly pay 
customers who request cash surrenders; however, 
statutory regulations generally provide up to six 
months in most states to fulfill surrender requests.

Our asset-liability management practices enable 
us to manage the differences between the cash flows 
generated by our investment portfolio and the 
expected cash flow requirements of our life insurance 
and annuity product obligations.

(1)  Liabilities for collateral are typically fully secured with cash or short-term investments.  We manage our short-term liquidity

position to ensure the availability of a sufficient amount of liquid assets to extinguish short-term liabilities as they come due in the
normal course of business, including utilizing potential sources of liquidity as disclosed previously.

(2)  Contractholder funds represent interest-bearing liabilities arising from the sale of products such as interest-sensitive life and fixed

annuities, including immediate annuities without life contingencies.  The reserve for life-contingent contract benefits relates
primarily to traditional life insurance, immediate annuities with life contingencies and voluntary accident and health insurance.
These amounts reflect the present value of estimated cash payments to be made to contractholders and policyholders.  Certain of
these contracts, such as immediate annuities without life contingencies, involve payment obligations where the amount and
timing of the payment are essentially fixed and determinable.  These amounts relate to (i) policies or contracts where we are
currently making payments and will continue to do so and (ii) contracts where the timing of a portion or all of the payments has
been determined by the contract.  Other contracts, such as interest-sensitive life, fixed deferred annuities, traditional life insurance
and voluntary accident and health insurance, involve payment obligations where a portion or all of the amount and timing of future
payments is uncertain.  For these contracts, we are not currently making payments and will not make payments until (i) the
occurrence of an insurable event such as death or illness or (ii) the occurrence of a payment triggering event such as the surrender
or partial withdrawal on a policy or deposit contract, which is outside of our control.  For immediate annuities with life
contingencies, the amount of future payments is uncertain since payments will continue as long as the annuitant lives.  We have
estimated the timing of payments related to these contracts based on historical experience and our expectation of future
payment patterns.  Uncertainties relating to these liabilities include mortality, morbidity, expenses, customer lapse and withdrawal
activity, estimated additional deposits for interest-sensitive life contracts, and renewal premium for life policies, which may
significantly impact both the timing and amount of future payments.  Such cash outflows reflect adjustments for the estimated
timing of mortality, retirement, and other appropriate factors, but are undiscounted with respect to interest.  As a result, the sum
of the cash outflows shown for all years in the table exceeds the corresponding liabilities of $19.43 billion for contractholder funds
and $12.55 billion for reserve for life-contingent contract benefits as included in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position
as of December 31, 2017.  The liability amount in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position reflects the discounting for
interest as well as adjustments for the timing of other factors as described above.

(3)  Amount differs from the balance presented on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December 31, 2017,

because the long-term debt amount above includes interest and excludes debt issuance costs.

(4)  Our payment obligations relating to operating leases, unconditional purchase obligations and pension and other postretirement

benefits (“OPEB”) contributions are managed within the structure of our intermediate to long-term liquidity management program.
(5)  The pension plans’ obligations in the next 12 months represent our planned contributions to certain unfunded non-qualified plans

where the benefit obligation exceeds the assets, and the remaining years’ contributions are projected based on the average
remaining service period using the current underfunded status of the plans.  The OPEB plans’ obligations are estimated based on
the expected benefits to be paid.  These liabilities are discounted with respect to interest, and as a result the sum of the cash
outflows shown for all years in the table exceeds the corresponding liability amount of $526 million included in other liabilities and
accrued expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.

(6)  Reserve for property and casualty insurance claims and claims expense is an estimate of amounts necessary to settle all

outstanding claims, including claims that have been IBNR as of the balance sheet date.  We have estimated the timing of these
payments based on our historical experience and our expectation of future payment patterns.  However, the timing of these
payments may vary significantly from the amounts shown above, especially for IBNR claims.  The ultimate cost of losses may vary
materially from recorded amounts that are our best estimates.

(7)  Other liabilities primarily include accrued expenses and certain benefit obligations and claim payments and other checks

outstanding.  Certain of these long-term liabilities are discounted with respect to interest, as a result the sum of the cash outflows
shown for all years in the table exceeds the corresponding liability amount by $5 million.

(8)  Balance sheet liabilities not included in the table above include unearned and advance premiums of $14.20 billion and gross 

deferred tax liabilities of $1.75 billion.  These items were excluded as they do not meet the definition of a contractual liability as we 
are not contractually obligated to pay these amounts to third parties.  Rather, they represent an accounting mechanism that 
allows us to present our financial statements on an accrual basis.  In addition, other liabilities of $306 million were not included in 
the table above because they did not represent a contractual obligation or the amount and timing of their eventual payment was 
sufficiently uncertain.

(9)  Net unrecognized tax benefits represent our potential future obligation to the taxing authority for a tax position that was not 

recognized in the consolidated financial statements.  We believe it is reasonably possible that the liability balance will not 
significantly increase within the next twelve months.  The resolution of this obligation may be for an amount different than what 
we have accrued.

Contractual commitments represent investment commitments such as private placements, limited partnership 

interests and other loans.  Limited partnership interests are typically funded over the commitment period which is 
shorter than the contractual expiration date of the partnership and as a result, the actual timing of the funding may 
vary.

We have agreements in place for services we conduct, generally at cost, between subsidiaries relating to 

insurance, reinsurance, loans and capitalization.  All material intercompany transactions have been appropriately 
eliminated in consolidation.  Intercompany transactions among insurance subsidiaries and affiliates have been 
approved by the appropriate departments of insurance as required.

Key Results and Updates  Enterprise Risk and Return Management

Enterprise Risk and Return Management
In addition to the normal risks of the business, 

Allstate is subject to significant risks as an insurer and 
a provider of other products and financial services.  
These risks are discussed in more detail in the Risk 
Factors section of this document.  We regularly 
measure, monitor and report on all significant risks, but 
the major categories of enterprise risks are insurance, 
financial, investment, operational and strategic.  
Allstate manages these risks through Enterprise Risk 
and Return Management (“ERRM”) governance 
practices, culture, and activities that are performed on 
an integrated, enterprise-wide basis, following our risk 
and return principles.  Our legal and capital structures 
are designed to manage capital and solvency on a legal 
entity basis.  Our risk-return principles define how we 
operate and guide decision-making around risk and 
return.  These principles state that our priority is to 
protect solvency, comply with laws and act with 
integrity.  Building upon this foundation, we strive to 
build strategic value and optimize risk and return.

Governance  ERRM governance includes board 

oversight, an executive management committee 
structure, as well as enterprise and business unit chief 
risk officers (“CROs”).  The Allstate Corporation Board 
of Directors (“Allstate Board”) has overall responsibility 
for oversight of management’s design and 
implementation of ERRM.  The Risk and Return 
Committee (“RRC”) of the Allstate Board oversees 
effectiveness of the ERRM framework, governance 
structure and decision-making, while focusing on the 
Company’s overall risk profile.  The Audit Committee 
oversees effectiveness of management’s control 
framework for risks.  The Enterprise Risk and Return 
Council (“ERRC”) is Allstate’s senior risk management 
committee that directs ERRM by establishing risk-
return targets, determining economic capital levels and 
directing integrated strategies and actions from an 
enterprise perspective.  The ERRC consists of Allstate’s 
chief executive officer, president, vice chair, business 
unit presidents, chief investment officer, enterprise and 
business unit chief risk officers and chief financial 
officers, general counsel and treasurer.  Other key 
committees work with the ERRC to direct ERRM 
activities, including the Strategy & Reinvention 
Committee (“S&RC”), the Operational Risk Council, the 
Corporate Asset Liability Committee, legal entity 
liability governance committees, and legal entity 
investment committees.

Key risks are assessed and reported quarterly 

through a comprehensive ERRM risk dashboard 
prepared for senior management and the RRC.  The 
risk dashboard communicates key risk and return 
conditions, provides an overall perspective of Allstate’s 
risk profile, and promotes active discussion and 
engagement with management and the RRC.  Internal 
controls over key risks are managed and reported to 
senior management and the Audit Committee of the 
Company through a semiannual risk control dashboard.  
Annually, we communicate with both the Allstate Board 
and RRC about economic capital and risks related to 
the strategic plan, operating plan, and incentive 
compensation programs.

Framework  We apply these principles using an 

integrated ERRM framework that focuses on 
measurement, transparency and dialogue.  Our 
framework provides a comprehensive view of risks and 
is used by senior management and business managers 
to drive strategic and business decisions.  We 
continually validate and improve our ERRM practices 
by benchmarking and obtaining external perspectives.

Allstate’s risk appetite is integrated in planning 

through our economic capital framework.  
Management and the ERRC rely on internal and 
external perspectives to determine an appropriate 
level of target economic capital.  Internal perspectives 
include enterprise solvency and volatility measures, 
stress scenarios, model assumptions, and 
management judgment.  External considerations 
include NAIC risk-based capital as well as S&P’s, 
Moody’s, and A.M. Best’s capital adequacy 
measurement.  Our economic capital reflects senior 
management’s view of the aggregate level of capital 
necessary to satisfy stakeholder interests, manage 
Allstate’s risk profile and maintain financial strength 
over a multiple year time horizon.  The impact of 
strategic initiatives on enterprise risk is evaluated 
through the economic capital risk-return framework.

The NAIC has adopted the Risk Management and 
Own Risk and Solvency Assessment Model Act (“ORSA 
Model Act”), which has been enacted by our insurance 
subsidiaries’ domiciliary states.  The ORSA Model Act 
requires that insurers maintain a risk management 
framework and conduct an internal own risk and 
solvency assessment of the insurer’s material risks in 
normal and stressed environments.  The assessment 
must be documented in a confidential annual summary 
report, a copy of which must be made available to 
regulators as required or upon request. 

The enterprise risk appetite is cascaded into 
individual risk limits which set boundaries on the 
amount of risk we are willing to accept from one 
specific risk category before escalating for further 
management discussion and action.  Risk limits are 
established based upon expected returns, volatility, 
tail/stress losses, and impact on the enterprise 
portfolio.  To effectively operate within risk limits and 
for risk-return optimization, business units establish 
risk limits and capital targets specific to their 
businesses.  Allstate’s risk management strategies 
adapt to changes in business and market 
environments.

Process  Our shared ERRM framework establishes 

a basis for transparency and dialogue across the 
enterprise and for continuous learning by embedding 
our risk and return management culture of identifying, 
measuring, managing, monitoring and reporting risks 
within the organization.  Allstate designs business and 
enterprise strategies that seek to optimize risk-
adjusted returns on capital.  Risks are managed at both 
the legal entity and enterprise level.  A summary of our 
process to manage each of our major risk categories 
follows:

Enterprise Risk and Return Management  Key Results and Updates

Insurance risk management addresses 

fluctuations in the timing, frequency, and severity of 
benefits, expenses, and premiums relative to the 
return expectations at the time of pricing inclusive of 
systemic risk, concentration of insurance exposures, 
policy terms, reinsurance coverage, and claims 
handling practices.  This includes credit risk that arises 
when an external party fails to meet a contractual 
obligation such as reinsurance for ceded claims.

Insurance risk exposures include our operating 

results and financial conditions, claims frequency and 
severity, catastrophes and severe weather, and 
mortality and morbidity risk.

Insurance risk exposures are measured and 
monitored with different approaches including:

• Stochastic methods: measures and monitors risks
such as natural catastrophes and severe weather.
We develop probabilistic estimates of risk based
on our exposures, historical observed volatility
and/or industry-recognized models in the case of
catastrophe risk.

• Scenario analysis: measures and monitors risks

and estimated losses due to catastrophe scenarios
and stress scenario events for mortality/morbidity
exposures.

Financial risk management addresses the risk of

insufficient cash flows to meet corporate or 
policyholder needs, risk of inadequate aggregate 
capital or capital within any subsidiary, inability to 
access capital markets or risk associated with a 
business counterparty default.

Financial risk exposures include capital resources 

and liquidity sources and uses.

We actively manage our capital and liquidity levels 

in light of changing market, economic, and business 
conditions.  Our capital position, capital generation 
capacity, and targeted risk profile provide strategic 
and financial flexibility.

We generally assess solvency on a statutory 

accounting basis, but also consider GAAP volatility.  
Current enterprise economic capital, which exceeds 
targeted levels, is based on a combination of statutory 
surplus and invested assets at the parent holding 
company level which were $18.63 billion and $1.95 
billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2017.

Investment risk management addresses financial 
loss due to changes in the valuations of assets held in 
the Allstate investment portfolio.  Such losses may be 
caused by macro developments, such as rising interest 
rates, widening credit spreads, and falling equity 
prices, or could be specific to individual investments in 
the portfolio.  These losses can encompass both daily 
market volatility and permanent impairments of capital 
due to credit defaults and equity write-downs.

Investment risk exposures include interest rate 
risk, credit spread risk, equity price risk and foreign 
currency exchange rate risk.

Investment risk exposures are measured and 

monitored in a number of ways including:

• Sensitivity analysis: measures the impact from a

unit change in a market risk input.

• Stochastic and probabilistic estimation of potential

losses: combines portfolio risk exposures with
historical or recent market volatilities and
correlations to assess the potential span of future
investment results.

• Stress testing: measures material adverse

outcomes such as shock scenarios applied to
credit, public and private equity markets.

Operational risk management addresses loss as a
result of the failure of people, processes, systems and 
culture.  Operational risk exposures include human 
resources, privacy, regulatory compliance, ethics, 
system availability, cybersecurity, data quality, disaster 
recovery and business continuity.

Operational risk is managed at the enterprise and 

business unit levels, with business units identifying, 
measuring, monitoring, managing, and reporting these 
and other operational risks at a more detailed level.

Strategic risk management addresses loss 
associated with inadequate or flawed business 
planning or strategy setting, including product mix, 
mergers or acquisitions and market positioning, and 
unexpected changes within the market or regulatory 
environment in which Allstate operates.  This includes 
reputational risk, which is the potential for negative 
publicity regarding a company’s conduct or business 
practices to adversely impact its profitability, 
operations, consumer base, or require costly litigation 
and other defensive measures.

We manage strategic risk through the Allstate 

Board and senior management strategy reviews that 
include a risk and return assessment of our strategic 
plans, S&RC governance, and ongoing monitoring of 
our strategic actions and the external competitive 
environment.  Using the ERRM framework, Allstate 
designs strategies that seek to optimize risk-adjusted 
returns on economic capital for risk types including 
interest rate risk, credit risk to equity investments with 
idiosyncratic return potential, auto profitability, and 
growing property exposure.

Key Results and Updates  Application of Critical Accounting Estimates and Other Disclosures

Application of Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in 

conformity with GAAP requires management to adopt 
accounting policies and make estimates and 
assumptions that affect amounts reported in the 
consolidated financial statements.  The most critical 
estimates, presented in the order they appear in the 
Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, include 
those used in determining:

• Fair value of financial assets

•

Impairment of fixed income and equity securities

• Deferred policy acquisition costs amortization

• Evaluation of goodwill for impairment

• Reserve for property and casualty insurance claims

and claims expense estimation

• Reserve for life-contingent contract benefits estimation

In making these determinations, management

makes subjective and complex judgments that 
frequently require estimates about matters that are 
inherently uncertain.  Many of these policies, estimates 
and related judgments are common in the insurance 
and financial services industries; others are specific to 
our businesses and operations.  It is reasonably likely 
that changes in these estimates could occur from 
period to period and result in a material impact on our 
consolidated financial statements.

A brief summary of each of these critical 

accounting estimates follows.  For a more detailed 
discussion of the effect of these estimates on our 
consolidated financial statements, and the judgments 
and assumptions related to these estimates, see the 
referenced sections of this document.  For a more 
detailed summary of our significant accounting 
policies, see the notes to the consolidated financial 
statements.

Fair value of financial assets  Fair value is defined 
as the price that would be received to sell an asset or 
paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction 
between market participants at the measurement 
date.  We are responsible for the determination of fair 
value of financial assets and the supporting 
assumptions and methodologies.  We use independent 
third-party valuation service providers, broker quotes 
and internal pricing methods to determine fair values.  
We obtain or calculate only one single quote or price 
for each financial instrument.

Valuation service providers typically obtain data 

about market transactions and other key valuation 
model inputs from multiple sources and, through the 
use of proprietary models, produce valuation 
information in the form of a single fair value for 
individual fixed income and other securities for which a 
fair value has been requested under the terms of our 
agreements.  The inputs used by the valuation service 
providers include, but are not limited to, market prices 
from recently completed transactions and transactions 
of comparable securities, interest rate yield curves, 
credit spreads, liquidity spreads, currency rates, and 

178  

  www.allstate.com

other information, as applicable.  Credit and liquidity 
spreads are typically implied from completed 
transactions and transactions of comparable securities.  
Valuation service providers also use proprietary 
discounted cash flow models that are widely accepted 
in the financial services industry and similar to those 
used by other market participants to value the same 
financial instruments.  The valuation models take into 
account, among other things, market observable 
information as of the measurement date, as described 
above, as well as the specific attributes of the security 
being valued including its term, interest rate, credit 
rating, industry sector, and where applicable, collateral 
quality and other issue or issuer specific information.  
Executing valuation models effectively requires 
seasoned professional judgment and experience.  For 
certain equity securities, valuation service providers 
provide market quotations for completed transactions 
on the measurement date.  In cases where market 
transactions or other market observable data is 
limited, the extent to which judgment is applied varies 
inversely with the availability of market observable 
information.

For certain of our financial assets measured at fair 

value, where our valuation service providers cannot 
provide fair value determinations, we obtain a single 
non-binding price quote from a broker familiar with the 
security who, similar to our valuation service providers, 
may consider transactions or activity in similar 
securities among other information.  The brokers 
providing price quotes are generally from the 
brokerage divisions of leading financial institutions with 
market making, underwriting and distribution expertise 
regarding the security subject to valuation.

The fair value of certain financial assets, including 
privately placed corporate fixed income securities and 
free-standing derivatives, for which our valuation 
service providers or brokers do not provide fair value 
determinations, is developed using valuation methods 
and models widely accepted in the financial services 
industry.  Our internal pricing methods are primarily 
based on models using discounted cash flow 
methodologies that develop a single best estimate of 
fair value.  Our models generally incorporate inputs 
that we believe are representative of inputs other 
market participants would use to determine fair value 
of the same instruments, including yield curves, quoted 
market prices of comparable securities or instruments, 
published credit spreads, and other applicable market 
data as well as instrument-specific characteristics that 
include, but are not limited to, coupon rates, expected 
cash flows, sector of the issuer, and call provisions.  
Because judgment is required in developing the fair 
values of these financial assets, they may differ from 
the amount actually received to sell an asset in an 
orderly transaction between market participants at the 
measurement date.  Moreover, the use of different 
valuation assumptions may have a material effect on 
the financial assets’ fair values.

For most of our financial assets measured at fair 

value, all significant inputs are based on or 
corroborated by market observable data, and 

Application of Critical Accounting Estimates and Other Disclosures  Key Results and Updates 

significant management judgment does not affect the 
periodic determination of fair value.  The determination 
of fair value using discounted cash flow models 
involves management judgment when significant 
model inputs are not based on or corroborated by 
market observable data.  However, where market 
observable data is available, it takes precedence, and 
as a result, no range of reasonably likely inputs exists 
from which the basis of a sensitivity analysis could be 
constructed.

We gain assurance that our financial assets are 

appropriately valued through the execution of various 
processes and controls designed to ensure the overall 
reasonableness and consistent application of valuation 
methodologies, including inputs and assumptions, and 
compliance with accounting standards.  For fair values 
received from third parties or internally estimated, our 
processes and controls are designed to ensure that the 
valuation methodologies are appropriate and 
consistently applied, the inputs and assumptions are 
reasonable and consistent with the objective of 
determining fair value, and the fair values are 
accurately recorded.  For example, on a continuing 
basis, we assess the reasonableness of individual fair 
values that have stale security prices or that exceed 
certain thresholds as compared to previous fair values 
received from valuation service providers or brokers or 
derived from internal models.  We perform procedures 
to understand and assess the methodologies, 
processes and controls of valuation service providers.  
In addition, we may validate the reasonableness of fair 
values by comparing information obtained from 

valuation service providers or brokers to other third 
party valuation sources for selected securities.  We 
perform ongoing price validation procedures such as 
back-testing of actual sales, which corroborate the 
various inputs used in internal models to market 
observable data.  When fair value determinations are 
expected to be more variable, we validate them 
through reviews by members of management who 
have relevant expertise and who are independent of 
those charged with executing investment transactions.

We also perform an analysis to determine whether 

there has been a significant decrease in the volume 
and level of activity for the asset when compared to 
normal market activity, and if so, whether transactions 
may not be orderly.  Among the indicators we consider 
in determining whether a significant decrease in the 
volume and level of market activity for a specific asset 
has occurred include the level of new issuances in the 
primary market, trading volume in the secondary 
market, level of credit spreads over historical levels, 
bid-ask spread, and price consensuses among market 
participants and sources.  If evidence indicates that 
prices are based on transactions that are not orderly, 
we place little, if any, weight on the transaction price 
and will estimate fair value using an internal model.  As 
of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we did not adjust fair 
values provided by our valuation service providers or 
brokers or substitute them with an internal model for 
such securities.

Impairment of fixed income and equity securities  

For investments classified as available for sale, the 
difference between fair value and amortized cost for 
fixed income securities and cost for equity securities, 
net of certain other items and deferred income taxes 
(as disclosed in Note 5), is reported as a component of 
AOCI on the Consolidated Statements of Financial 
Position and is not reflected in the operating results of 
any period until reclassified to net income upon the 
consummation of a transaction with an unrelated third 
party or when a write-down is recorded due to an 
other-than-temporary decline in fair value.  We have a 
comprehensive portfolio monitoring process to identify 
and evaluate each fixed income and equity security 
whose carrying value may be other-than-temporarily 
impaired.

For each fixed income security in an unrealized loss 

position, we assess whether management with the 
appropriate authority has made the decision to sell or

whether it is more likely than not we will be required to 
sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost 
basis for reasons such as liquidity, contractual or 
regulatory purposes.  If a security meets either of these 
criteria, the security’s decline in fair value is considered 
other than temporary and is recorded in earnings.  

If we have not made the decision to sell the fixed 
income security and it is not more likely than not we 
will be required to sell the fixed income security before 
recovery of its amortized cost basis, we evaluate 
whether we expect to receive cash flows sufficient to 
recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security.  
We use our best estimate of future cash flows 
expected to be collected from the fixed income 
security, discounted at the security’s original or current 
effective rate, as appropriate, to calculate a recovery 
value and determine whether a credit loss exists.  The 
determination of cash flow estimates is inherently 
subjective and methodologies may vary depending on 
facts and circumstances specific to the security.  All 
reasonably available information relevant to the 
collectability of the security, including past events, 

2017 Annual Report  179

Key Results and Updates  Application of Critical Accounting Estimates and Other Disclosures

current conditions, and reasonable and supportable 
assumptions and forecasts, is considered when 
developing the estimate of cash flows expected to be 
collected.  That information generally includes, but is 
not limited to, the remaining payment terms of the 
security, prepayment speeds, foreign exchange rates, 
the financial condition and future earnings potential of 
the issue or issuer, expected defaults, expected 
recoveries, the value of underlying collateral, vintage, 
geographic concentration, available reserves or 
escrows, current subordination levels, third party 
guarantees and other credit enhancements.  Other 
information, such as industry analyst reports and 
forecasts, sector credit ratings, financial condition of 
the bond insurer for insured fixed income securities, 
and other market data relevant to the realizability of 
contractual cash flows, may also be considered.  The 
estimated fair value of collateral will be used to 
estimate recovery value if we determine that the 
security is dependent on the liquidation of collateral for 
ultimate settlement.  If the estimated recovery value is 
less than the amortized cost of the security, a credit 
loss exists and an other-than-temporary impairment 
for the difference between the estimated recovery 
value and amortized cost is recorded in earnings.  The 
portion of the unrealized loss related to factors other 
than credit remains classified in AOCI.  If we determine 
that the fixed income security does not have sufficient 
cash flow or other information to estimate a recovery 
value for the security, we may conclude that the entire 
decline in fair value is deemed to be credit related and 
the loss is recorded in earnings.

There are a number of assumptions and estimates 
inherent in evaluating impairments of equity securities 
and determining if they are other than temporary, 
including: 1) our ability and intent to hold the 
investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for an 
anticipated recovery in value; 2) the financial condition, 
near-term and long-term prospects of the issue or 
issuer, including relevant industry specific market 
conditions and trends, geographic location and 
implications of rating agency actions and offering 
prices; 3) the specific reasons that a security is in an 
unrealized loss position, including overall market 
conditions which could affect liquidity; and 4) the 
length of time and extent to which the fair value has 
been less than cost.

Once assumptions and estimates are made, any 
number of changes in facts and circumstances could 
cause us to subsequently determine that a fixed 
income or equity security is other-than-temporarily 
impaired, including: 1) general economic conditions 
that are worse than previously forecast or that have a 
greater adverse effect on a particular issuer or industry 
sector than originally estimated; 2) changes in the 
facts and circumstances related to a particular issue or 
issuer’s ability to meet all of its contractual obligations; 
and 3) changes in facts and circumstances that result 
in management’s decision to sell or result in our 
assessment that it is more likely than not we will be 
required to sell before recovery of the amortized cost 
basis of a fixed income security or causes a change in 
our ability or intent to hold an equity security until it 
recovers in value.  Changes in assumptions, facts and 
180  

  www.allstate.com

circumstances could result in additional charges to 
earnings in future periods to the extent that losses are 
realized.  The charge to earnings, while potentially 
significant to net income, would not have a significant 
effect on shareholders’ equity, since our securities are 
designated as available for sale and carried at fair value 
and as a result, any related unrealized loss, net of 
deferred income taxes and related DAC, deferred sales 
inducement costs and reserves for life-contingent 
contract benefits, would already be reflected as a 
component of AOCI in shareholders’ equity.

The determination of the amount of other-than-

temporary impairment is an inherently subjective 
process based on periodic evaluations of the factors 
described above.  Such evaluations and assessments 
are revised as conditions change and new information 
becomes available.  We update our evaluations 
regularly and reflect changes in other-than-temporary 
impairments in our results of operations as such 
evaluations are revised.  The use of different 
methodologies and assumptions in the determination 
of the amount of other-than-temporary impairments 
may have a material effect on the amounts recognized 
and presented within the consolidated financial 
statements.

For additional detail on investment impairments, 

see Note 5 of the consolidated financial statements.

Deferred policy acquisition costs amortization  

We incur significant costs in connection with acquiring 
insurance policies and investment contracts.  In 
accordance with GAAP, costs that are related directly 
to the successful acquisition of new or renewal 
insurance policies and investment contracts are 
deferred and recorded as an asset on the Consolidated 
Statements of Financial Position.

DAC related to property and casualty contracts is 

amortized into income as premiums are earned, 
typically over periods of six or twelve months for 
personal lines policies or generally one to five years for 
protection plans and service contracts. 

DAC related to traditional life and voluntary 

accident and health insurance is amortized over the 
premium paying period of the related policies in 
proportion to the estimated revenues on such 
business.  Significant assumptions relating to 
estimated premiums, investment returns, as well as 
mortality, persistency and expenses to administer the 
business are established at the time the policy is 
issued and are generally not revised during the life of 
the policy.  The assumptions for determining the 
timing and amount of DAC amortization are consistent 
with the assumptions used to calculate the reserve for 
life-contingent contract benefits.  Any deviations from 
projected business in force resulting from actual policy 
terminations differing from expected levels and any 
estimated premium deficiencies may result in a change 
to the rate of amortization in the period such events 
occur.  Generally, the amortization periods for these 
policies approximate the estimated lives of the 
policies.  The recovery of DAC is dependent upon the 
future profitability of the business.  We periodically 
review the adequacy of reserves and recoverability of 

Application of Critical Accounting Estimates and Other Disclosures  Key Results and Updates 

DAC for these policies using actual experience and 
current assumptions.  Prior to fourth quarter 2017, we 
evaluated our traditional life insurance products and 
immediate annuities with life contingencies on an 
aggregate basis.  In conjunction with the segment 
changes in fourth quarter 2017, traditional life 
insurance products, immediate annuities with life 
contingencies, and voluntary accident and health 
insurance products are reviewed individually.  In the 
event actual experience and current assumptions are 
adverse compared to the original assumptions and a 
premium deficiency is determined to exist, any 
remaining unamortized DAC balance must be 
expensed to the extent not recoverable and a premium 
deficiency reserve may be required if the remaining 
DAC balance is insufficient to absorb the deficiency.  In 
2017, 2016 and 2015, our reviews concluded that no 
premium deficiency adjustments were necessary.  For 
additional detail on reserve adequacy, see the Reserve 
for life-contingent contract benefits estimation section. 

DAC related to interest-sensitive life insurance and 

fixed annuities is amortized in proportion to the 
incidence of the total present value of gross profits, 
which includes both actual historical gross profits 
(“AGP”) and estimated future gross profits (“EGP”) 
expected to be earned over the estimated lives of the 
contracts.  The amortization is net of interest on the 
prior period DAC balance using rates established at the 
inception of the contracts.  Actual amortization periods 
generally range from 15-30 years; however, 
incorporating estimates of the rate of customer 
surrenders, partial withdrawals and deaths generally 
results in the majority of the DAC being amortized 
during the surrender charge period, which is typically 
10-20 years for interest-sensitive life and 5-10 years for
fixed annuities.  The rate of DAC amortization is
reestimated and adjusted by a cumulative charge or
credit to income when there is a difference between
the incidence of actual versus expected gross profits in
a reporting period or when there is a change in total
EGP.

AGP and EGP primarily consist of the following 

components: contract charges for the cost of 
insurance less mortality costs and other benefits 
(benefit margin); investment income and realized 
capital gains and losses less interest credited 
(investment margin); and surrender and other contract 
charges less maintenance expenses (expense margin).  
The principal assumptions for determining the amount 
of EGP are mortality, persistency, expenses, 
investment returns, including capital gains and losses 
on assets supporting contract liabilities, interest 
crediting rates to contractholders, and the effects of 
any hedges, and these assumptions are reasonably 

likely to have the greatest impact on the amount of 
DAC amortization.  Changes in these assumptions can 
be offsetting and we are unable to reasonably predict 
their future movements or offsetting impacts over 
time.

Each reporting period, DAC amortization is 
recognized in proportion to AGP for that period 
adjusted for interest on the prior period DAC balance.  
This amortization process includes an assessment of 
AGP compared to EGP, the actual amount of business 
remaining in force and realized capital gains and losses 
on investments supporting the product liability.  The 
impact of realized capital gains and losses on 
amortization of DAC depends upon which product 
liability is supported by the assets that give rise to the 
gain or loss.  If the AGP is greater than EGP in the 
period, but the total EGP is unchanged, the amount of 
DAC amortization will generally increase, resulting in a 
current period decrease to earnings.  The opposite 
result generally occurs when the AGP is less than the 
EGP in the period, but the total EGP is unchanged.  
However, when DAC amortization or a component of 
gross profits for a quarterly period is potentially 
negative (which would result in an increase of the DAC 
balance) as a result of negative AGP, the specific facts 
and circumstances surrounding the potential negative 
amortization are considered to determine whether it is 
appropriate for recognition in the consolidated 
financial statements.  Negative amortization is only 
recorded when the increased DAC balance is 
determined to be recoverable based on facts and 
circumstances.  For products whose supporting 
investments are exposed to capital losses in excess of 
our expectations which may cause periodic AGP to 
become temporarily negative, EGP and AGP utilized in 
DAC amortization may be modified to exclude the 
excess capital losses.

Annually, we review and update the assumptions 
underlying the projections of EGP, including mortality, 
persistency, expenses, investment returns, comprising 
investment income and realized capital gains and 
losses, interest crediting rates and the effect of any 
hedges, using our experience and industry experience.  
At each reporting period, we assess whether any 
revisions to assumptions used to determine DAC 
amortization are required.  These reviews and updates 
may result in amortization acceleration or deceleration, 
which are referred to as “DAC unlocking”.  If the update 
of assumptions causes total EGP to increase, the rate 
of DAC amortization will generally decrease, resulting 
in a current period increase to earnings.  A decrease to 
earnings generally occurs when the assumption 
update causes the total EGP to decrease.

In 2017, DAC amortization acceleration for changes 
in the investment margin component of EGP related to 
interest-sensitive life insurance and was due to 
continued low interest rates and lower projected 
investment returns.  The deceleration related to 
benefit margin primarily related to interest-sensitive 
life insurance and was due to a decrease in projected 
mortality. 

In 2016, DAC amortization deceleration for changes 
in the investment margin component of EGP related to 
interest-sensitive life insurance and was due to 
increased projected investment margins from a 
favorable asset portfolio mix.  The acceleration related 
to benefit margin primarily related to interest-sensitive 
life insurance and was due to lower than expected 
persistency on non-guaranteed products.  The

Evaluation of goodwill for impairment  Goodwill 
represents the excess of amounts paid for acquiring 
businesses over the fair value of the net assets 
acquired, less any impairment of goodwill recognized.  
Our goodwill reporting units are equivalent to our

Businesses, Allstate Life and Allstate Benefits to which 
goodwill has been assigned.

Goodwill is recognized when acquired and 

allocated to reporting units based on which unit is 
expected to benefit from the synergies of the business 
combination.  Goodwill is not amortized but is tested 
for impairment at least annually.  We perform our 
annual goodwill impairment testing during the fourth 
quarter of each year based upon data as of the close of 
the third quarter.  We also review goodwill for 
impairment whenever events or changes in 
circumstances, such as deteriorating or adverse 
market conditions, indicate that it is more likely than 
not that the carrying amount of goodwill may exceed 
its implied fair value.  The goodwill impairment analysis

primarily related to interest-sensitive life insurance and 
was due to a decrease in projected expenses.

is performed at the reporting unit level which is equal 
to our reportable segments.

In fourth quarter 2017, we adopted new reportable 

segments, which required us to evaluate goodwill, 
including the allocation of goodwill to any new 
reporting units on a relative fair value basis.  The 
reallocation was computed using fair values for the 
goodwill reporting units determined using discounted 
cash flow (“DCF”) calculations and market to book 
multiples derived from a peer company analysis as 
described below.  In conjunction with the reallocation 
of goodwill, we recognized $125 million of goodwill 
impairment related to the goodwill allocated to the 
Allstate Annuities reporting unit reflecting a market-
based valuation.  The fair value of our remaining 
goodwill reporting units exceeded their carrying 
values.  To periodically estimate the fair value of our 
goodwill reporting units, we may utilize a combination 
of widely accepted valuation techniques including a 
stock price and market capitalization analysis, DCF 
calculations and market to book multiples derived from 
a peer company analysis.  The stock price and market 
capitalization analysis takes into consideration the 
quoted market price of our outstanding common stock 
and includes a control premium, derived from relevant 
historical acquisition activity, in determining the 
estimated fair value of the consolidated entity before 
allocating that fair value to individual reporting units.  
The DCF analysis utilizes long term assumptions for 
revenues, investment income, benefits, claims, other 
operating expenses and income taxes to produce 
projections of both income and cash flows available for 
dividends that are present valued using weighted 
average cost of capital.  Market to book multiples 
represent the mean market to book multiple for 
selected peer companies with operations similar to our 
goodwill reporting units to which the multiple is 
applied.  The outputs from these methods are 
weighted based on the nature of the business and the 

Application of Critical Accounting Estimates and Other Disclosures  Key Results and Updates 

relative amount of market observable assumptions 
supporting the estimates.  The computed values are 
then weighted to reflect the fair value estimate based 
on the specific attributes of each goodwill reporting 
unit.

Estimating the fair value of reporting units is a 

subjective process that involves the use of significant 
estimates by management.  Regarding all reporting 
units tested, market declines or other events 
impacting the fair value of these businesses, including 
discount rates, operating results, investment returns 
and strategies and growth rate assumptions or 
increases in the level of equity required to support 
these businesses, could result in goodwill impairments, 
resulting in a charge to income.

Reserve for property and casualty insurance 

claims and claims expense estimation  Reserves are 
established to provide for the estimated costs of 
paying claims and claims expenses under insurance 
policies we have issued.  Underwriting results are 
significantly influenced by estimates of property and 
casualty insurance claims and claims expense reserves.  
These reserves are an estimate of amounts necessary 
to settle all outstanding claims, including IBNR, as of 
the financial statement date.

Characteristics of reserves  Reserves are 

established independently of business segment 
management for each business segment and line of 
business based on estimates of the ultimate cost to 
settle claims, less losses that have been paid.  The 
significant lines of business are auto, homeowners, and 
other personal lines for Allstate Protection, and 
asbestos, environmental, and other discontinued lines 
for Discontinued Lines and Coverages.  Allstate 
Protection’s claims are typically reported promptly with 
relatively little reporting lag between the date of 
occurrence and the date the loss is reported.  Auto and 
homeowners liability losses generally take an average 
of about two years to settle, while auto physical 
damage, homeowners property and other personal 
lines have an average settlement time of less than one 
year.  Discontinued Lines and Coverages involve long-
tail losses, such as those related to asbestos and 
environmental claims, which often involve substantial 
reporting lags and extended times to settle.

Reserves are the difference between the 

estimated ultimate cost of losses incurred and the 
amount of paid losses as of the reporting date.  
Reserves are estimated for both reported and 
unreported claims, and include estimates of all 
expenses associated with processing and settling all 
incurred claims.  We update most of our reserve 
estimates quarterly and as new information becomes 
available or as events emerge that may affect the 
resolution of unsettled claims.  Changes in prior 
reserve estimates (reserve reestimates), which may be 
material, are determined by comparing updated 
estimates of ultimate losses to prior estimates, with 
the differences recorded as property and casualty 
insurance claims and claims expense in the 
Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period 
such changes are determined.  Estimating the ultimate 
cost of claims and claims expenses is an inherently 

uncertain and complex process involving a high degree 
of judgment and is subject to the evaluation of 
numerous variables.

The actuarial methods used to develop reserve 
estimates  Reserve estimates are derived by using 
several different actuarial estimation methods that are 
variations on one primary actuarial technique.  The 
actuarial technique is known as a “chain ladder” 
estimation process in which historical loss patterns are 
applied to actual paid losses and reported losses (paid 
losses plus individual case reserves established by 
claim adjusters) for an accident year or a report year to 
create an estimate of how losses are likely to develop 
over time.  An accident year refers to classifying claims 
based on the year in which the claims occurred.  A 
report year refers to classifying claims based on the 
year in which the claims are reported.  Both 
classifications are used to prepare estimates of 
required reserves for payments to be made in the 
future.  The key assumptions affecting our reserve 
estimates comprise data elements including claim 
counts, paid losses, case reserves, and development 
factors calculated with this data.

In the chain ladder estimation technique, a ratio 

(development factor) is calculated which compares 
current period results to results in the prior period for 
each accident year.  A three-year or two-year average 
development factor, based on historical results, is 
usually multiplied by the current period experience to 
estimate the development of losses of each accident 
year into the next time period.  The development 
factors for the future time periods for each accident 
year are compounded over the remaining future 
periods to calculate an estimate of ultimate losses for 
each accident year.  The implicit assumption of this 
technique is that an average of historical development 
factors is predictive of future loss development, as the 
significant size of our experience database achieves a 
high degree of statistical credibility in actuarial 
projections of this type.  The effects of inflation are 
implicitly considered in the reserving process, the 
implicit assumption being that a multi-year average 
development factor includes an adequate provision.  
This assumption may require modification when data 
changes due to changing claim reporting practices, 
changing claim settlement patterns, external 
regulatory or financial influences, or contractual 
coverage changes.  In these situations, actuarial 
estimation techniques are applied to appropriately 
modify the “chain ladder” assumptions.  These 
actuarial techniques are necessary to analyze the 
effects of changing loss data to develop modified 
development factor selections.  The actuarial 
estimation techniques include exclusion of unusual 
losses or aberrations and adjustment of historical data 
to present conditions.  Actuarially modified patterns of 
development are calculated with the adjusted 
historical data.  Actuarial judgment is then applied to 
make appropriate development factor assumptions 
needed to develop a best estimate of gross ultimate 
losses.  These developments are discussed further in 
the Allstate brand loss ratio disclosures in the Allstate 
Protection Segment section of the MD&A.

Key Results and Updates  Application of Critical Accounting Estimates and Other Disclosures

How reserve estimates are established and 

updated  Reserve estimates are developed at a very 
detailed level, and the results of these numerous 
micro-level best estimates are aggregated to form a 
consolidated reserve estimate.  For example, over one 
thousand actuarial estimates of the types described 
above are prepared each quarter to estimate losses for 
each line of insurance, major components of losses 
(such as coverages and perils), major states or groups 
of states and for reported losses and IBNR.  The 
actuarial methods described above are used to analyze 
the settlement patterns of claims by determining the 
development factors for specific data elements that 
are necessary components of a reserve estimation 
process.  Development factors are calculated quarterly 
and periodically throughout the year for data elements 
such as claim counts reported and settled, paid losses, 
and paid losses combined with case reserves.  The 
calculation of development factors from changes in 
these data elements also impacts claim severity 
trends, which is a common industry reference used to 
explain changes in reserve estimates.  The historical 
development patterns for these data elements are 
used as the assumptions to calculate reserve 
estimates.

Often, several different estimates are prepared for 

each detailed component, incorporating alternative 
analyses of changing claim settlement patterns and 
other influences on losses, from which we select our 
best estimate for each component, occasionally 
incorporating additional analyses and actuarial 
judgment, as described above.  These micro-level 
estimates are not based on a single set of 
assumptions.  Actuarial judgments that may be applied 
to these components of certain micro-level estimates 
generally do not have a material impact on the 
consolidated level of reserves.  Moreover, this detailed 
micro-level process does not permit or result in a 
compilation of a company-wide roll up to generate a 
range of needed loss reserves that would be 
meaningful.  Based on our review of these estimates, 
our best estimate of required reserves for each state/

line/coverage component is recorded for each accident 
year, and the required reserves for each component 
are summed to create the reserve balance carried on 
our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.

Reserves are reestimated quarterly and 

periodically throughout the year, by combining 
historical results with current actual results to calculate 
new development factors.  This process incorporates 
the historic and latest actual trends, and other 
underlying changes in the data elements used to 
calculate reserve estimates.  New development factors 
are likely to differ from previous development factors 
used in prior reserve estimates because actual results 
(claims reported or settled, losses paid, or changes to 
case reserves) occur differently than the implied 
assumptions contained in the previous development 
factor calculations.  If claims reported, paid losses, or 
case reserve changes are greater or less than the 
levels estimated by previous development factors, 
reserve reestimates increase or decrease.  When actual 
development of these data elements is different than 
the historical development pattern used in a prior 
period reserve estimate, a new reserve is determined.  
The difference between indicated reserves based on 
new reserve estimates and recorded reserves (the 
previous estimate) is the amount of reserve reestimate 
and is recognized as an increase or decrease in claims 
and claims expense in the Consolidated Statements of 
Operations.  Total net reserve reestimates, after-tax, 
impact on net income applicable to common 
shareholders were 10.6% favorable in 2017, 0.6% 
favorable in 2016 and 2.6% unfavorable in 2015.  The 3-
year average of net reserve reestimates as a 
percentage of total reserves was a favorable 1.3% for 
Allstate Protection, an unfavorable 5.8% for 
Discontinued Lines and Coverages and an unfavorable 
6.1% for Service Businesses, each of these results being 
consistent within a reasonable actuarial tolerance for 
our respective businesses.  A more detailed discussion 
of reserve reestimates is presented in the Claims and 
Claims Expense Reserves section of the MD&A.

Allstate Protection reserve estimate  

Factors affecting reserve estimates  Reserve 

estimates are developed based on the processes and 
historical development trends described above.  These 
estimates are considered in conjunction with known 
facts and interpretations of circumstances and factors 
including our experience with similar cases, actual 
claims paid, historical trends involving claim payment 
patterns and pending levels of unpaid claims, loss 
management programs, product mix and contractual 
terms, changes in law and regulation, judicial decisions, 
and economic conditions.  When we experience 
changes of the type previously mentioned, we may 
need to apply actuarial judgment in the determination 
and selection of development factors considered more 
reflective of the new trends, such as combining shorter 
or longer periods of historical results with current 
actual results to produce development factors based 
on two-year, three-year, or longer development periods 
to reestimate our reserves.  For example, if a legal 
change is expected to have a significant impact on the 
development of claim severity for a coverage which is 
part of a particular line of insurance in a specific state, 
actuarial judgment is applied to determine appropriate 
development factors that will most accurately reflect 
the expected impact on that specific estimate.  
Another example would be when a change in economic 
conditions is expected to affect the cost of repairs to 
damaged autos or property for a particular line, 
coverage, or state, actuarial judgment is applied to 
determine appropriate development factors to use in 
the reserve estimate that will most accurately reflect 
the expected impacts on severity development.

As claims are reported, for certain liability claims of 

sufficient size and complexity, the field adjusting staff 
establishes case reserve estimates of ultimate cost, 
based on their assessment of facts and circumstances 
related to each individual claim.  For other claims which 
occur in large volumes and settle in a relatively short 
time frame, it is not practical or efficient to set case 
reserves for each claim, and a statistical case reserve is 
set for these claims based on estimation techniques 
described above.  In the normal course of business, we 
may also supplement our claims processes by utilizing 
third party adjusters, appraisers, engineers, inspectors, 
and other professionals and information sources to 
assess and settle catastrophe and non-catastrophe 
related claims.

Historically, the case reserves set by the field 
adjusting staff have not proven to be an entirely 
accurate estimate of the ultimate cost of claims.  To 
provide for this, a development reserve is estimated 
using the processes described above, and allocated to 
pending claims as a supplement to case reserves.  
Typically, the case, including statistical case, and 
supplemental development reserves comprise about 
90% of total reserves.

Another major component of reserves is IBNR, 

which comprises about 10% of total reserves.  IBNR can 
be a small percentage of reserves for relatively short-
term claims, such as auto physical damage claims, or a 
large percentage of reserves for claims that have 
uncertain payout requirements over a long period of 

time, such as auto injury and MCCA claims.  All major 
components of reserves are affected by changes in 
claim frequency as well as claim severity.

Generally, the initial reserves for a new accident 
year are established based on actual claim frequency 
and severity assumptions for different business 
segments, lines and coverages based on historical 
relationships to relevant inflation indicators.  Reserves 
for prior accident years are statistically determined 
using processes described above.  Changes in auto 
claim frequency may result from changes in mix of 
business, the rate of distracted driving, miles driven or 
other macroeconomic factors.  Changes in auto current 
year claim severity are generally influenced by inflation 
in the medical and auto repair sectors of the economy 
and the effectiveness and efficiency of our claim 
practices.  We mitigate these effects through various 
loss management programs.  Injury claims are affected 
largely by medical cost inflation while physical damage 
claims are affected largely by auto repair cost inflation 
and used car prices.  For auto physical damage 
coverages, we monitor our rate of increase in average 
cost per claim against the Maintenance and Repair 
price index and the Parts and Equipment price index 
and other external indices.  We believe our claim 
settlement initiatives, such as improvements to the 
claim review and settlement process, the use of special 
investigative units to detect fraud and handle suspect 
claims, litigation management and defense strategies, 
as well as various other loss management initiatives 
underway, contribute to the mitigation of injury and 
physical damage severity trends.

Changes in homeowners current year claim 

severity are generally influenced by inflation in the cost 
of building materials, the cost of construction and 
property repair services, the cost of replacing home 
furnishings and other contents, the types of claims 
that qualify for coverage, deductibles, other economic 
and environmental factors and the effectiveness and 
efficiency of our claim practices.  We employ various 
loss management programs to mitigate the effect of 
these factors.

As loss experience for the current year develops 
for each type of loss, it is monitored relative to initial 
assumptions until it is judged to have sufficient 
statistical credibility.  From that point in time and 
forward, reserves are reestimated using statistical 
actuarial processes to reflect the impact actual loss 
trends have on development factors incorporated into 
the actuarial estimation processes.  Statistical 
credibility is usually achieved by the end of the first 
calendar year; however, when trends for the current 
accident year exceed initial assumptions sooner, they 
are usually determined to be credible, and reserves are 
increased accordingly.

The very detailed processes for developing reserve 

estimates, and the lack of a need and existence of a 
common set of assumptions or development factors, 
limits aggregate reserve level testing for variability of 
data elements.  However, by applying standard 
actuarial methods to consolidated historic accident 
year loss data for major loss types, comprising auto 
injury losses, auto physical damage losses and 

2017 Annual Report  185

Key Results and Updates  Application of Critical Accounting Estimates and Other Disclosures

homeowner losses, we develop variability analyses 
consistent with the way we develop reserves by 
measuring the potential variability of development 
factors, as described in the section titled “Potential 
Reserve Estimate Variability” below.

Causes of reserve estimate uncertainty  Since 

reserves are estimates of unpaid portions of claims and 
claims expenses that have occurred, including IBNR 
losses, the establishment of appropriate reserves, 
including reserves for catastrophe losses, requires 
regular reevaluation and refinement of estimates to 
determine our ultimate loss estimate.

At each reporting date, the highest degree of 

uncertainty in estimates for most of our losses arise 
from claims remaining to be settled for the current 
accident year and the most recent preceding accident 
year.  The greatest degree of uncertainty exists in the 
current accident year because the current accident 
year contains the greatest proportion of losses that 
have not been reported or settled but must be 
estimated as of the current reporting date.  Most of 
these losses relate to damaged property such as 
automobiles and homes, and medical care for injuries 
from accidents.  During the first year after the end of 
an accident year, a large portion of the total losses for 
that accident year are settled.  When accident year 
losses paid through the end of the first year following 
the initial accident year are incorporated into updated 
actuarial estimates, the trends inherent in the 
settlement of claims emerge more clearly.  
Consequently, this is the point in time at which we tend 
to make our largest reestimates of losses for an 
accident year.  After the second year, the losses that 
we pay for an accident year typically relate to claims 
that are more difficult to settle, such as those involving 
serious injuries or litigation.  Private passenger auto 
insurance provides a good illustration of the 
uncertainty of future loss estimates: our typical annual 
percentage payout of reserves remaining at December 
31 for an accident year is approximately 45% in the first 
year after the end of the accident year, 20% in the 
second year, 15% in the third year, 10% in the fourth 
year, and the remaining 10% thereafter.

Reserves for catastrophe losses  Catastrophe 

losses are an inherent risk of the property and casualty 
insurance industry that have contributed, and will 
continue to contribute, to potentially material year-to-
year fluctuations in our results of operations and 
financial position.  We define a “catastrophe” as an 
event that produces pre-tax losses before reinsurance 
in excess of $1 million and involves multiple first party 
policyholders, or a winter weather event that produces 
a number of claims in excess of a preset, per-event 
threshold of average claims in a specific area, occurring 
within a certain amount of time following the event.  
Catastrophes are caused by various natural events 
including high winds, winter storms and freezes, 
tornadoes, hailstorms, wildfires, tropical storms, 
hurricanes, earthquakes and volcanoes.  We are also 
exposed to man-made catastrophic events, such as 
certain types of terrorism or industrial accidents.  The 
nature and level of catastrophes in any period cannot 
be reliably predicted.
186

  www.allstate.com

The estimation of claims and claims expense 

reserves for catastrophe losses also comprises 
estimates of losses from reported claims and IBNR, 
primarily for damage to property.  In general, our 
estimates for catastrophe reserves are based on claim 
adjuster inspections and the application of historical 
loss development factors as described above.  
However, depending on the nature of the catastrophe, 
the estimation process can be further complicated.  
For example, for hurricanes, complications could 
include the inability of insureds to promptly report 
losses, limitations placed on claims adjusting staff 
affecting their ability to inspect losses, determining 
whether losses are covered by our homeowners policy 
(generally for damage caused by wind or wind driven 
rain) or specifically excluded coverage caused by flood, 
estimating additional living expenses, and assessing 
the impact of demand surge, exposure to mold 
damage, and the effects of numerous other 
considerations, including the timing of a catastrophe in 
relation to other events, such as at or near the end of a 
financial reporting period, which can affect the 
availability of information needed to estimate reserves 
for that reporting period.  In these situations, we may 
need to adapt our practices to accommodate these 
circumstances in order to determine a best estimate of 
our losses from a catastrophe.  For example, to 
complete estimates for certain areas affected by 
catastrophes not yet inspected by our claims adjusting 
staff, or where we believed our historical loss 
development factors were not predictive, we rely on 
analysis of actual claim notices received compared to 
total PIF, as well as visual, governmental and third 
party information, including aerial photos using drones 
and satellites, area observations, and data on wind 
speed and flood depth to the extent available. 

Potential reserve estimate variability  The 

aggregation of numerous micro-level estimates for 
each business segment, line of insurance, major 
components of losses (such as coverages and perils), 
and major states or groups of states for reported 
losses and IBNR forms the reserve liability recorded in 
the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.  
Because of this detailed approach to developing our 
reserve estimates, there is not a single set of 
assumptions that determines our reserve estimates at 
the consolidated level.  Given the numerous micro-level 
estimates for reported losses and IBNR, management 
does not believe the processes that we follow will 
produce a statistically credible or reliable actuarial 
reserve range that would be meaningful.  Reserve 
estimates, by their very nature, are very complex to 
determine and subject to significant judgment, and do 
not represent an exact determination for each 
outstanding claim.  Accordingly, as actual claims, paid 
losses, and/or case reserve results emerge, our 
estimate of the ultimate cost to settle will be different 
than previously estimated.

To develop a statistical indication of potential 
reserve variability within reasonably likely possible 
outcomes, an actuarial technique (stochastic modeling) 
is applied to the countrywide consolidated data 
elements for paid losses and paid losses combined 
with case reserves separately for injury losses, auto 

Application of Critical Accounting Estimates and Other Disclosures  Key Results and Updates 

physical damage losses, and homeowners losses 
excluding catastrophe losses.  Based on the combined 
historical variability of the development factors 
calculated for these data elements, an estimate of the 
standard error or standard deviation around these 
reserve estimates is calculated within each accident 
year for the last twelve years for each type of loss.  The 
variability of these reserve estimates within one 
standard deviation of the mean (a measure of 
frequency of dispersion often viewed to be an 
acceptable level of accuracy) is believed by 
management to represent a reasonable and 
statistically probable measure of potential variability.  
Based on our products and coverages, historical 
experience, the statistical credibility of our extensive 
data and stochastic modeling of actuarial chain ladder 
methodologies used to develop reserve estimates, we 
estimate that the potential variability of our Allstate 
Protection reserves, excluding reserves for catastrophe 
losses, within a reasonable probability of other possible 
outcomes, may be approximately plus or minus 4%, or 
plus or minus $750 million in net income applicable to 
common shareholders at the newly enacted 21% U.S. 
corporate tax rate.  A lower level of variability exists for 
auto injury losses, which comprise approximately 80% 
of reserves, due to their relatively stable development 
patterns over a longer duration of time required to 
settle claims.  Other types of losses, such as auto 
physical damage, homeowners losses and other 
personal lines losses, which comprise about 20% of 
reserves, tend to have greater variability but are 
settled in a much shorter period of time.  Although this 
evaluation reflects most reasonably likely outcomes, it 
is possible the final outcome may fall below or above 
these amounts.  Historical variability of reserve 
estimates is reported in the Claims and Claims 
Expense Reserves section of the MD&A.

Reserves for Michigan and New Jersey unlimited 
personal injury protection  Claims and claims expense 
reserves include reserves for Michigan mandatory 
unlimited personal injury protection coverage to 
insureds involved in qualifying motor vehicle accidents.  
The administration of this program is through the 
MCCA, a state-mandated, non-profit association of 
which all insurers actively writing automobile coverage 
in Michigan are members.    

The comprehensive process employed to estimate 

MCCA covered losses involves a number of activities 
including the comprehensive review and interpretation 
of MCCA actuarial reports, other MCCA members’ 
reports and our personal injury protection loss trends 
which have increased in severity over time.  A 
significant portion of incurred claim reserves can be 
attributed to a small number of catastrophic claims 
and thus a large portion of the recoverable is similarly 
concentrated.  We conduct comprehensive claim file 
reviews to develop case reserve type estimates of 
specific claims, which have increased our view of future 
claim development and longevity of claimants.  Each 
year, we update the actuarial estimate of our ultimate 
reserves and recoverables.  We report our paid and 
unpaid claims based on MCCA requirements and are 
considering the value of reporting our case reserves, 
which include our best estimate of the ultimate claim 

cost excluding IBNR, for the MCCA to verify their 
reserves.  The MCCA does not provide member 
companies with its estimate of a company’s claim 
costs.  We continue to update each comprehensive 
claim file case reserve estimate when there is a 
significant change in the status of the claimant, or 
once every three years if there have been no significant 
changes.  

We provide similar personal injury protection 
coverage in New Jersey for auto policies issued or 
renewed in New Jersey prior to 1991 that is 
administered by PLIGA.  We use similar actuarial 
estimating techniques as for the MCCA exposures to 
estimate loss reserves for unlimited personal injury 
protection coverage for policies covered by PLIGA.  We 
continue to update our estimates for these claims as 
the status of claimants changes.  However, unlimited 
coverage was no longer offered after 1991, therefore no 
new claimants are being added.    

Reserve estimates by their nature are very 

complex to determine and subject to significant 
judgments, and do not represent an exact 
determination for each outstanding claim.  Claims may 
be subject to litigation.  As actual claims, paid losses 
and/or case reserve results emerge, our estimate of 
the ultimate cost to settle may be materially greater or 
less than previously estimated amounts. 

Adequacy of reserve estimates  We believe our net 
claims and claims expense reserves are appropriately 
established based on available methodologies, facts, 
technology, laws and regulations.  We calculate and 
record a single best reserve estimate, in conformance 
with generally accepted actuarial standards, for each 
line of insurance, its components (coverages and perils) 
and state, for reported losses and for IBNR losses, and 
as a result we believe that no other estimate is better 
than our recorded amount.  Due to the uncertainties 
involved, the ultimate cost of losses may vary 
materially from recorded amounts, which are based on 
our best estimates.

Discontinued Lines and Coverages reserve estimates 

Characteristics of Discontinued Lines exposure  
Our exposure to asbestos, environmental and other 
discontinued lines claims arise principally from 
assumed reinsurance coverage written during the 
1960s through the mid-1980s, including reinsurance on 
primary insurance written on large U.S. companies, and 
from direct excess commercial insurance written from 
1972 through 1985, including substantial excess general 
liability coverages on large U.S. companies.  Additional 
exposure stems from direct primary commercial 
insurance written during the 1960 through the 
mid-1980s.  Asbestos claims relate primarily to bodily 
injuries asserted by people who were exposed to 
asbestos or products containing asbestos.  
Environmental claims relate primarily to pollution and 
related clean-up costs.  Other discontinued lines 
exposures primarily relate to general liability and 
product liability mass tort claims, such as those for 
medical devices and other products, workers’ 
compensation claims and claims for various other 

2017 Annual Report  187
2017 Annual Report  187

Key Results and Updates  Application of Critical Accounting Estimates and Other Disclosures

coverage exposures other than asbestos and 
environmental.

In 1986, the general liability policy form used by us 

and others in the property and casualty industry was 
amended to introduce an “absolute pollution 
exclusion,” which excluded coverage for environmental 
damage claims, and to add an asbestos exclusion.  
Most general liability policies issued prior to 1987 
contain annual aggregate limits for product liability 
coverage.  General liability policies issued in 1987 and 
thereafter contain annual aggregate limits for product 
liability coverage and annual aggregate limits for all 
coverages.  Our experience to date is that these policy 
form changes have limited the extent of our exposure 
to environmental and asbestos claim risks.

Our exposure to liability for asbestos, 

environmental and other discontinued lines losses 
manifests differently depending on whether it arises 
from assumed reinsurance coverage, direct excess 
commercial insurance or direct primary commercial 
insurance.  The direct insurance coverage we provided 
that covered asbestos, environmental and other 
discontinued lines was substantially “excess” in nature.

Direct excess commercial insurance and 

reinsurance involve coverage written by us for specific 
layers of protection above retentions and other 
insurance plans.  The nature of excess coverage and 
reinsurance provided to other insurers limits our 
exposure to loss to specific layers of protection in 
excess of policyholder retention on primary insurance 
plans.  Our exposure is further limited by the significant 
reinsurance that we had purchased on our direct 
excess business.

Our assumed reinsurance business involved 

writing generally small participations in other insurers’ 
reinsurance programs.  The reinsured losses in which 
we participate may be a proportion of all eligible losses 
or eligible losses in excess of defined retentions.  The 
majority of our assumed reinsurance exposure, 
approximately 85%, is for excess of loss coverage, while 
the remaining 15% is for pro-rata coverage.

Our direct primary commercial insurance business 

did not include coverage to large asbestos 
manufacturers.  This business comprises a cross 
section of policyholders engaged in many diverse 
business sectors throughout the country.

How reserve estimates are established and 

updated  We conduct an annual review in the third 
quarter to evaluate and establish asbestos, 
environmental and other discontinued lines reserves.  
Changes to reserves are recorded in the reporting 
period in which they are determined.  Using 
established industry and actuarial best practices and 
assuming no change in the regulatory or economic 
environment, this detailed and comprehensive 
methodology determines asbestos reserves based on 

188  
188  

  www.allstate.com
  www.allstate.com

assessments of the characteristics of exposure (i.e. 
claim activity, potential liability, jurisdiction, products 
versus non-products exposure) presented by individual 
policyholders, and determines environmental reserves 
based on assessments of the characteristics of 
exposure (i.e. environmental damages, respective 
shares of liability of potentially responsible parties, 
appropriateness and cost of remediation) to pollution 
and related clean-up costs.  The number and cost of 
these claims is affected by intense advertising by trial 
lawyers seeking asbestos plaintiffs, and entities with 
asbestos exposure seeking bankruptcy protection as a 
result of asbestos liabilities, initially causing a delay in 
the reporting of claims, often followed by an 
acceleration and an increase in claims and claims 
expenses as settlements occur.

After evaluating our insureds’ probable liabilities 

for asbestos and/or environmental claims, we evaluate 
our insureds’ coverage programs for such claims.  We 
consider our insureds’ total available insurance 
coverage, including the coverage we issued.  We also 
consider relevant judicial interpretations of policy 
language and applicable coverage defenses or 
determinations, if any.

Evaluation of both the insureds’ estimated 

liabilities and our exposure to the insureds depends 
heavily on an analysis of the relevant legal issues and 
litigation environment.  This analysis is conducted by 
our specialized claims adjusting staff and legal counsel.  
Based on these evaluations, case reserves are 
established by claims adjusting staff and actuarial 
analysis is employed to develop an IBNR reserve, which 
includes estimated potential reserve development and 
claims that have occurred but have not been reported.  
As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, IBNR was 53% and 
57% of combined net asbestos and environmental 
reserves.

For both asbestos and environmental reserves, we 
also evaluate our historical direct net loss and expense 
paid and incurred experience to assess any emerging 
trends, fluctuations or characteristics suggested by the 
aggregate paid and incurred activity.

Other Discontinued Lines and Coverages 

Characteristics of other exposures  Other mass 

torts includes direct excess commercial and 
reinsurance general liability coverage provided for 
cumulative injury losses other than asbestos and 
environmental.  Workers’ compensation and 
commercial and other include run-off from 
discontinued direct primary, direct excess commercial 
and reinsurance commercial insurance operations of 
various coverage exposures other than asbestos and 
environmental.  Reserves are based on considerations 
similar to those described above, as they relate to the 
characteristics of specific individual coverage 
exposures.

Potential reserve estimate variability  Establishing 

Discontinued Lines and Coverages net loss reserves for 
asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines 
claims is subject to uncertainties that are much greater 
than those presented by other types of property and 
casualty claims.  Among the complications are lack of 
historical data, long reporting delays, uncertainty as to 
the number and identity of insureds with potential 
exposure and unresolved legal issues regarding policy 
coverage; unresolved legal issues regarding the 
determination, availability and timing of exhaustion of 
policy limits; plaintiffs’ evolving and expanding theories 
of liability; availability and collectability of recoveries 
from reinsurance; retrospectively determined 
premiums and other contractual agreements; 
estimates of the extent and timing of any contractual 
liability; the impact of bankruptcy protection sought by 
various asbestos producers and other asbestos 
defendants; and other uncertainties.  There are also 
complex legal issues concerning the interpretation of 
various insurance policy provisions and whether those 
losses are covered, or were ever intended to be 
covered, and could be recoverable through 
retrospectively determined premium, reinsurance or 
other contractual agreements.  Courts have reached 
different and sometimes inconsistent conclusions as to 
when losses are deemed to have occurred and which 
policies provide coverage; what types of losses are 
covered; whether there is an insurer obligation to 
defend; how policy limits are determined; how policy 
exclusions and conditions are applied and interpreted; 
and whether clean-up costs represent insured property 
damage.  Our reserves for asbestos and environmental 
exposures could be affected by tort reform, class 
action litigation, and other potential legislation and 
judicial decisions.  Environmental exposures could also 
be affected by a change in the existing federal 
Superfund law and similar state statutes.  There can be 
no assurance that any reform legislation will be 
enacted or that any such legislation will provide for a 
fair, effective and cost-efficient system for settlement 
of asbestos or environmental claims.  We believe these 
issues are not likely to be resolved in the near future, 
and the ultimate costs may vary materially from the 
amounts currently recorded resulting in material 
changes in loss reserves.  Historical variability of 
reserve estimates is demonstrated in the Claims and 
Claims Expense Reserves section of the MD&A.

individual policyholders, assuming no change in the 
legal, legislative or economic environment.  Due to the 
uncertainties and factors described above, 
management believes it is not practicable to develop a 
meaningful range for any such additional net loss 
reserves that may be required.

Further discussion of reserve estimates  For further 
discussion of these estimates and quantification of the 
impact of reserve estimates, reserve reestimates and 
assumptions, see Notes 8 and 14 of the consolidated 
financial statements and the Claims and Claims 
Expense Reserves section of the MD&A.

Reserve for life-contingent contract benefits 

estimation  Due to the long term nature of traditional 
life insurance, life-contingent immediate annuities and 
voluntary accident and health insurance products, 
benefits are payable over many years; accordingly, the 
reserves are calculated as the present value of future 
expected benefits to be paid, reduced by the present 
value of future expected net premiums.  Long-term 
actuarial assumptions of future investment yields, 
mortality, morbidity, policy terminations and expenses 
are used when establishing the reserve for life-
contingent contract benefits payable under these 
insurance policies.  These assumptions, which for 
traditional life insurance are applied using the net level 
premium method, include provisions for adverse 
deviation and generally vary by characteristics such as 
type of coverage, year of issue and policy duration.  
Future investment yield assumptions are determined 
based upon prevailing investment yields as well as 
estimated reinvestment yields.  Mortality, morbidity 
and policy termination assumptions are based on our 
experience and industry experience.  Expense 
assumptions include the estimated effects of inflation 
and expenses to be incurred beyond the premium-
paying period.  These assumptions are established at 
the time the policy is issued, are consistent with 
assumptions for determining DAC amortization for 
these policies, and are generally not changed during 
the policy coverage period.  However, if actual 
experience emerges in a manner that is significantly 
adverse relative to the original assumptions, 
adjustments to DAC or reserves may be required 
resulting in a charge to earnings which could have a 
material effect on our operating results and financial 
condition. 

We periodically review the adequacy of reserves 

and recoverability of DAC for these policies using 
actual experience and current assumptions.  In the 
event actual experience and current assumptions are 
adverse compared to the original assumptions and a 
premium deficiency is determined to exist, any 
remaining unamortized DAC balance must be 
expensed to the extent not recoverable and the

establishment of a premium deficiency reserve may be 
required.  

Prior to fourth quarter 2017, we evaluated our 
traditional life insurance products and immediate 
annuities with life contingencies on an aggregate basis.  
In conjunction with the segment changes in fourth 
quarter 2017, traditional life insurance products, 
immediate annuities with life contingencies, and 
voluntary accident and health insurance are reviewed 
individually.  In 2017, 2016 and 2015, our reviews 
concluded that no premium deficiency adjustments 
were necessary.  As of December 31, 2017, traditional 
life insurance has a substantial sufficiency.  As of 
December 31, 2017, there is marginal sufficiency in the 
evaluation of immediate annuities with life 
contingencies.  Sufficiency has been adversely 
impacted primarily due to sub-standard structured 
settlement mortality expectations.  The sufficiency 
represents approximately 86% and 1% of applicable 
reserves as of December 31, 2017 for Allstate Life and 
Allstate Annuities, respectively.  Additional reserves 
may be required in future periods if the evaluation 
results in a premium deficiency.

In 2016, we completed a mortality study for our 

structured settlement annuities with life contingencies.

We also review these policies for circumstances 
where projected profits would be recognized in early 
years followed by projected losses in later years.  In 
2017, 2016 and 2015, our reviews concluded that there 
were no projected losses following projected profits in 
each long-term projection.

We will continue to monitor the experience of our 
traditional life insurance and immediate annuities.  We 
anticipate that mortality, investment and reinvestment 
Regulation and Legal Proceedings 

The study indicated that annuitants are living longer 
and receiving benefits for a longer period than 
originally estimated due to medical advances and 
access to medical care.  The results of the study were 
included in the premium deficiency and profits 
followed by losses evaluations as of December 31, 2016, 
and no adjustments were recognized.  

In 2016, there was a favorable change in the long-
term investment yield assumptions due to investment 
strategy changes to increase performance-based 
investments and equity securities.  The favorable 
impact of higher long-term investment yield 
assumptions more than offset the impact of 
unfavorable mortality assumptions.  The investment 
strategy changes for immediate annuities are 
discussed further in the Allstate Annuities Segment 
section of the MD&A.

The following table displays the sensitivity of 

changes in the future investment yield assumption 
included in the annuity premium deficiency evaluation 
to the sufficiency balance as of December 31, 2017.

yields, and policy terminations are the factors that 
would be most likely to require premium deficiency 
adjustments to these reserves or related DAC.  
Mortality rates and investment and reinvestment yields 
are the factors that would be most likely to require a 
profits followed by losses liability accrual.

For further detail on the reserve for life-contingent 

contract benefits, see Note 9 of the consolidated 
financial statements.

We are subject to extensive regulation and we are involved in various legal and regulatory actions, all of which have 

an effect on specific aspects of our business.  For a detailed discussion of the legal and regulatory actions in which we 
are involved, see Note 14 of the consolidated financial statements.
Pending Accounting Standards

There are several pending accounting standards that we have not implemented because the implementation date 

has not yet occurred.  For a discussion of these pending standards, see Note 2 of the consolidated financial 
statements.

The effect of implementing certain accounting standards on our financial results and financial condition is often 
based in part on market conditions at the time of implementation of the standard and other factors we are unable to 
determine prior to implementation.  For this reason, we are sometimes unable to estimate the effect of certain pending 
accounting standards until the relevant authoritative body finalizes these standards or until we implement them.

2017 Annual Report  195

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1 General

Basis of presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial 

statements include the accounts of The Allstate 
Corporation (the “Corporation”) and its wholly owned 
subsidiaries, primarily Allstate Insurance Company 
(“AIC”), a property and casualty insurance company 
with various property and casualty and life and 
investment subsidiaries, including Allstate Life 
Insurance Company (“ALIC”) (collectively referred to as 
the “Company” or “Allstate”).  These consolidated 
financial statements have been prepared in conformity 
with accounting principles generally accepted in the 
United States of America (“GAAP”).  All significant 
intercompany accounts and transactions have been 
eliminated.

The preparation of financial statements in 

conformity with GAAP requires management to make 
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts 
reported in the consolidated financial statements and 
accompanying notes.  Actual results could differ from 
those estimates.

In fourth quarter 2017, the Company revised its 
reportable segments.  For additional information on 
impacts of the revised segments, see Notes 2, 4 and 9.  
To conform to the current year presentation, certain 
amounts in the prior years’ notes have been updated 
to reflect changes in reportable segments. 

Nature of operations

Allstate is engaged, principally in the United 

States, in the property and casualty insurance and life 
insurance business.  Allstate was the country’s second 
largest personal property and casualty insurer as of 
December 31, 2016.  Allstate is organized into seven 
reportable segments: Allstate Protection, Discontinued 
Lines and Coverages, Service Businesses, Allstate Life, 
Allstate Benefits, Allstate Annuities, and Corporate and 
Other.  

Allstate’s primary business is the sale of private 

passenger auto and homeowners insurance.  The 
Company also offers several other personal property 
and casualty insurance products, select commercial 
property and casualty coverages, consumer product 
protection plans, device and mobile data collection 
services and analytic solutions, roadside assistance, 
finance and insurance products, life insurance and 
voluntary accident and health insurance.  Allstate 
primarily distributes its products through exclusive 
agencies, financial specialists, independent agencies 
and brokers, major retailers, contact centers and the 
internet.

Risks and uncertainties

Allstate has exposure to catastrophes, an inherent 

risk of the property and casualty insurance business, 
which have contributed, and will continue to 
contribute, to material year-to-year fluctuations in the 
Company’s results of operations and financial position 
(see Note 8).  The nature and level of catastrophic loss 
caused by natural events (high winds, winter storms, 
tornadoes, hailstorms, wildfires, tropical storms, 
hurricanes, earthquakes and volcanoes) and man-made 
events (terrorism and industrial accidents) experienced 
in any period cannot be predicted and could be 
material to results of operations and financial position.  
The Company considers the greatest areas of potential 
catastrophe losses due to hurricanes to generally be 
major metropolitan centers in counties along the 
eastern and gulf coasts of the United States.  The 
Company considers the greatest areas of potential 
catastrophe losses due to earthquakes and fires 
following earthquakes to be major metropolitan areas 
near fault lines in the states of California, Oregon, 
Washington, South Carolina, Missouri, Kentucky and 
Tennessee.  The Company also has exposure to 
asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines 
claims (see Notes 8 and 14).

Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Investments

Fixed income securities include bonds, asset-

backed securities (“ABS”), residential mortgage-backed 
securities (“RMBS”), commercial mortgage-backed 
securities (“CMBS”) and redeemable preferred stocks.  
Fixed income securities, which may be sold prior to 
their contractual maturity, are designated as available 
for sale and are carried at fair value.  The difference 
between amortized cost and fair value, net of deferred 
income taxes and related life and annuity deferred 
policy acquisition costs (“DAC”), deferred sales 
inducement costs (“DSI”) and reserves for life-
contingent contract benefits, is reflected as a 
component of accumulated other comprehensive 
income (“AOCI”).  Cash received from calls and make-
whole payments is reflected as a component of 
proceeds from sales and cash received from maturities 
196  

  www.allstate.com

and pay-downs is reflected as a component of 
investment collections within the Consolidated 
Statements of Cash Flows.

Equity securities primarily include common stocks, 

exchange traded and mutual funds, non-redeemable 
preferred stocks and real estate investment trust 
equity investments.  Certain exchange traded and 
mutual funds have fixed income securities as their 
underlying investments.  Equity securities are 
designated as available for sale and are carried at fair 
value.  The difference between cost and fair value, net 
of deferred income taxes, is reflected as a component 
of AOCI.

Mortgage loans are carried at unpaid principal 

balances, net of unamortized premium or discount and 
valuation allowances.  Valuation allowances are 

established for impaired loans when it is probable that 
contractual principal and interest will not be collected.

Investments in limited partnership interests 

include interests in private equity funds, real estate 
funds and other funds.  Where the Company’s interest 
is so minor that it exercises virtually no influence over 
operating and financial policies, investments in limited 
partnership interests are accounted for in accordance 
with the cost method of accounting; all other 
investments in limited partnership interests are 
accounted for in accordance with the equity method of 
accounting (“EMA”).

Short-term investments, including commercial 
paper, U.S. Treasury bills, money market funds and 
other short-term investments, are carried at fair value.  
Other investments primarily consist of bank loans, 
policy loans, agent loans, real estate and derivatives.  
Bank loans are primarily senior secured corporate loans 
and are carried at amortized cost.  Policy loans are 
carried at unpaid principal balances and were $905 
million and $904 million as of December 31, 2017 and 
2016, respectively.  Agent loans are loans issued to 
exclusive Allstate agents and are carried at unpaid 
principal balances, net of valuation allowances and 
unamortized deferred fees or costs.  Real estate is 
carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.  
Derivatives are carried at fair value.

Investment income primarily consists of interest, 
dividends, income from limited partnership interests, 
rental income from real estate, and income from 
certain derivative transactions.  Interest is recognized 
on an accrual basis using the effective yield method 
and dividends are recorded at the ex-dividend date.  
Interest income for ABS, RMBS and CMBS is 
determined considering estimated pay-downs, 
including prepayments, obtained from third party data 
sources and internal estimates.  Actual prepayment 
experience is periodically reviewed and effective yields 
are recalculated when differences arise between the 
prepayments originally anticipated and the actual 
prepayments received and currently anticipated.  For 
ABS, RMBS and CMBS of high credit quality with fixed 
interest rates, the effective yield is recalculated on a 
retrospective basis.  For all others, the effective yield is 
recalculated on a prospective basis.  Accrual of income 
is suspended for other-than-temporarily impaired fixed 
income securities when the timing and amount of cash 
flows expected to be received is not reasonably 
estimable.  Accrual of income is suspended for 
mortgage loans, bank loans and agent loans that are in 
default or when full and timely collection of principal 
and interest payments is not probable.  Cash receipts 
on investments on nonaccrual status are generally 
recorded as a reduction of carrying value.  Income from 
cost method limited partnership interests is 
recognized upon receipt of amounts distributed by the 
partnerships.  Income from EMA limited partnership 
interests is recognized based on the Company’s share 
of the partnerships’ earnings and unrealized gains and 
losses resulting from valuation changes of the 
underlying investments, and is generally recognized on 
a three month delay due to the availability of the 
related financial statements. 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

Realized capital gains and losses include gains and 

losses on investment sales, write-downs in value due 
to other-than-temporary declines in fair value, 
adjustments to valuation allowances on mortgage 
loans and agent loans, periodic changes in fair value 
and settlements of certain derivatives including hedge 
ineffectiveness and valuation changes in public 
securities held in certain limited partnerships.  Realized 
capital gains and losses on investment sales are 
determined on a specific identification basis.

Derivative and embedded derivative financial instruments

Derivative financial instruments include interest 

rate swaps, credit default swaps, futures (interest rate 
and equity), options (including swaptions), interest rate 
caps, warrants and rights, foreign currency swaps, 
foreign currency forwards and certain investment risk 
transfer reinsurance agreements.  Derivatives required 
to be separated from the host instrument and 
accounted for as derivative financial instruments 
(“subject to bifurcation”) are embedded in equity-
indexed life and annuity contracts, reinsured variable 
annuity contracts and certain funding agreements.

All derivatives are accounted for on a fair value 

basis and reported as other investments, other assets, 
other liabilities and accrued expenses or 
contractholder funds.  Embedded derivative 
instruments subject to bifurcation are also accounted 
for on a fair value basis and are reported together with 
the host contract.  The change in fair value of 
derivatives embedded in life and annuity product 
contracts and subject to bifurcation is reported in life 
and annuity contract benefits or interest credited to 
contractholder funds.  Cash flows from embedded 
derivatives subject to bifurcation and derivatives 
receiving hedge accounting are reported consistently 
with the host contracts and hedged risks, respectively, 
within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.  
Cash flows from other derivatives are reported in cash 
flows from investing activities within the Consolidated 
Statements of Cash Flows.

When derivatives meet specific criteria, they may 
be designated as accounting hedges and accounted 
for as fair value, cash flow, foreign currency fair value or 
foreign currency cash flow hedges.  The hedged item 
may be either all or a specific portion of a recognized 
asset, liability or an unrecognized firm commitment 
attributable to a particular risk for fair value hedges.  At 
the inception of the hedge, the Company formally 
documents the hedging relationship and risk 
management objective and strategy.  The 
documentation identifies the hedging instrument, the 
hedged item, the nature of the risk being hedged and 
the methodology used to assess the effectiveness of 
the hedging instrument in offsetting the exposure to 
changes in the hedged item’s fair value attributable to 
the hedged risk.  For a cash flow hedge, this 
documentation includes the exposure to changes in 
the variability in cash flows attributable to the hedged 
risk.  The Company does not exclude any component 
of the change in fair value of the hedging instrument 
from the effectiveness assessment.  At each reporting 
date, the Company confirms that the hedging 

2017 Annual Report  197

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

instrument continues to be highly effective in 
offsetting the hedged risk.  Ineffectiveness in fair value 
hedges and cash flow hedges, if any, is reported in 
realized capital gains and losses.

Fair value hedges    The change in fair value of 

hedging instruments used in fair value hedges of 
investment assets or a portion thereof is reported in 
net investment income, together with the change in 
fair value of the hedged items.  The change in fair value 
of hedging instruments used in fair value hedges of 
contractholder funds liabilities or a portion thereof is 
reported in interest credited to contractholder funds, 
together with the change in fair value of the hedged 
items.  Accrued periodic settlements on swaps are 
reported together with the changes in fair value of the 
swaps in net investment income or interest credited to 
contractholder funds.  The amortized cost for fixed 
income securities, the carrying value for mortgage 
loans or the carrying value of the hedged liability is 
adjusted for the change in fair value of the hedged risk.

Cash flow hedges    For hedging instruments used 

in cash flow hedges, the changes in fair value of the 
derivatives representing the effective portion of the 
hedge are reported in AOCI.  Amounts are reclassified 
to net investment income, realized capital gains and 
losses or interest expense as the hedged or forecasted 
transaction affects income.  Accrued periodic 
settlements on derivatives used in cash flow hedges 
are reported in net investment income.  The amount 
reported in AOCI for a hedged transaction is limited to 
the lesser of the cumulative gain or loss on the 
derivative less the amount reclassified to income, or 
the cumulative gain or loss on the derivative needed to 
offset the cumulative change in the expected future 
cash flows on the hedged transaction from inception of 
the hedge less the derivative gain or loss previously 
reclassified from AOCI to income.  If the Company 
expects at any time that the loss reported in AOCI 
would lead to a net loss on the combination of the 
hedging instrument and the hedged transaction which 
may not be recoverable, a loss is recognized 
immediately in realized capital gains and losses.  If an 
impairment loss is recognized on an asset or an 
additional obligation is incurred on a liability involved in 
a hedge transaction, any offsetting gain in AOCI is 
reclassified and reported together with the impairment 
loss or recognition of the obligation.

Termination of hedge accounting    If, subsequent 

to entering into a hedge transaction, the derivative 
becomes ineffective (including if the hedged item is 
sold or otherwise extinguished, the occurrence of a 
hedged forecasted transaction is no longer probable or 
the hedged asset becomes other-than-temporarily 
impaired), the Company may terminate the derivative 
position.  The Company may also terminate derivative 
instruments or redesignate them as non-hedge as a 
result of other events or circumstances.  If the 
derivative instrument is not terminated when a fair 
value hedge is no longer effective, the future gains and 
losses recognized on the derivative are reported in 
realized capital gains and losses.  When a fair value 
hedge is no longer effective, is redesignated as non-
hedge or when the derivative has been terminated, the 
198  
198  

  www.allstate.com
  www.allstate.com

fair value gain or loss on the hedged asset, liability or 
portion thereof which has already been recognized in 
income while the hedge was in place and used to 
adjust the amortized cost for fixed income securities, 
the carrying value for mortgage loans or the carrying 
value of the hedged liability, is amortized over the 
remaining life of the hedged asset, liability or portion 
thereof, and reflected in net investment income or 
interest credited to contractholder funds beginning in 
the period that hedge accounting is no longer applied.  
If the hedged item in a fair value hedge is an asset that 
has become other-than-temporarily impaired, the 
adjustment made to the amortized cost for fixed 
income securities or the carrying value for mortgage 
loans is subject to the accounting policies applied to 
other-than-temporarily impaired assets.

When a derivative instrument used in a cash flow 

hedge of an existing asset or liability is no longer 
effective or is terminated, the gain or loss recognized 
on the derivative is reclassified from AOCI to income as 
the hedged risk impacts income.  If the derivative 
instrument is not terminated when a cash flow hedge 
is no longer effective, the future gains and losses 
recognized on the derivative are reported in realized 
capital gains and losses.  When a derivative instrument 
used in a cash flow hedge of a forecasted transaction is 
terminated because it is probable the forecasted 
transaction will not occur, the gain or loss recognized 
on the derivative is immediately reclassified from AOCI 
to realized capital gains and losses in the period that 
hedge accounting is no longer applied.

Non-hedge derivative financial instruments    For 

derivatives for which hedge accounting is not applied, 
the income statement effects, including fair value gains 
and losses and accrued periodic settlements, are 
reported either in realized capital gains and losses or in 
a single line item together with the results of the 
associated asset or liability for which risks are being 
managed.

Securities loaned

The Company’s business activities include 
securities lending transactions, which are used 
primarily to generate net investment income.  The 
proceeds received in conjunction with securities 
lending transactions are reinvested in short-term 
investments or fixed income securities.  These 
transactions are short-term in nature, usually 30 days 
or less.

The Company receives cash collateral for securities 
loaned in an amount generally equal to 102% and 105% 
of the fair value of domestic and foreign securities, 
respectively, and records the related obligations to 
return the collateral in other liabilities and accrued 
expenses.  The carrying value of these obligations 
approximates fair value because of their relatively 
short-term nature.  The Company monitors the market 
value of securities loaned on a daily basis and obtains 
additional collateral as necessary under the terms of 
the agreements to mitigate counterparty credit risk.  
The Company maintains the right and ability to 
repossess the securities loaned on short notice.

Recognition of premium revenues and contract 
charges, and related benefits and interest credited

include life-contingent benefit payments in excess of 
the contractholder account balance.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

Property and casualty insurance premiums include 

premiums from personal lines policies, protection 
plans, and other contracts (primarily related to finance 
and insurance products) backed by insurance.  
Personal lines and protection plans insurance 
premiums are deferred and earned on a pro-rata basis 
over the terms of the policies, typically periods of six or 
twelve months for personal lines policies and one to 
five years for protection plans.  Other contracts 
(primarily related to finance and insurance products) 
premiums are deferred and earned over the terms of 
the contract, generally one to five years, aligned with 
the costs of performing services under the contract.  
The portion of premiums written applicable to the 
unexpired terms of the policies is recorded as 
unearned premiums.  Premium installment receivables, 
net, represent premiums written and not yet collected, 
net of an allowance for uncollectible premiums.  The 
Company regularly evaluates premium installment 
receivables and adjusts its valuation allowance as 
appropriate.  The valuation allowance for uncollectible 
premium installment receivables was $77 million and 
$84 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, 
respectively.

Traditional life insurance products consist 

principally of products with fixed and guaranteed 
premiums and benefits, primarily term and whole life 
insurance products.  Voluntary accident and health 
insurance products are expected to remain in force for 
an extended period and therefore are primarily 
classified as long-duration contracts.  Premiums from 
these products are recognized as revenue when due 
from policyholders.  Benefits are reflected in contract 
benefits and recognized over the life of the policy in 
relation to premiums.

Immediate annuities with life contingencies, 

including certain structured settlement annuities, 
provide insurance protection over a period that 
extends beyond the period during which premiums are 
collected.  Premiums from these products are 
recognized as revenue when received at the inception 
of the contract.  Benefits and expenses are recognized 
in relation to premiums.  Profits from these policies 
come primarily from investment income, which is 
recognized over the life of the contract.

Interest-sensitive life contracts, such as universal 

life and single premium life, are insurance contracts 
whose terms are not fixed and guaranteed.  The terms 
that may be changed include premiums paid by the 
contractholder, interest credited to the contractholder 
account balance and contract charges assessed 
against the contractholder account balance.  Premiums 
from these contracts are reported as contractholder 
fund deposits.  Contract charges consist of fees 
assessed against the contractholder account balance 
for the cost of insurance (mortality risk), contract 
administration and surrender of the contract prior to 
contractually specified dates.  These contract charges 
are recognized as revenue when assessed against the 
contractholder account balance.  Contract benefits 

Contracts that do not subject the Company to 

significant risk arising from mortality or morbidity are 
referred to as investment contracts.  Fixed annuities, 
including market value adjusted annuities, equity-
indexed annuities and immediate annuities without life 
contingencies, and funding agreements (primarily 
backing medium-term notes) are considered 
investment contracts.  Consideration received for such 
contracts is reported as contractholder fund deposits.  
Contract charges for investment contracts consist of 
fees assessed against the contractholder account 
balance for maintenance, administration and surrender 
of the contract prior to contractually specified dates, 
and are recognized when assessed against the 
contractholder account balance.

Interest credited to contractholder funds 

represents interest accrued or paid on interest-
sensitive life and investment contracts.  Crediting rates 
for certain fixed annuities and interest-sensitive life 
contracts are adjusted periodically by the Company to 
reflect current market conditions subject to 
contractually guaranteed minimum rates.  Crediting 
rates for indexed life and annuities and indexed 
funding agreements are generally based on a specified 
interest rate index or an equity index, such as the 
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (“S&P 500”).  Interest 
credited also includes amortization of DSI expenses.  
DSI is amortized into interest credited using the same 
method used to amortize DAC.

Contract charges for variable life and variable 

annuity products consist of fees assessed against the 
contractholder account balances for contract 
maintenance, administration, mortality, expense and 
surrender of the contract prior to contractually 
specified dates.  Contract benefits incurred for variable 
annuity products include guaranteed minimum death, 
income, withdrawal and accumulation benefits.  
Substantially all of the Company’s variable annuity 
business is ceded through reinsurance agreements 
and the contract charges and contract benefits related 
thereto are reported net of reinsurance ceded.

Deferred policy acquisition and sales inducement 
costs

Costs that are related directly to the successful 
acquisition of new or renewal insurance policies and 
investment contracts are deferred and recorded as 
DAC.  These costs are principally agents’ and brokers’ 
remuneration, premium taxes and certain underwriting 
expenses.  DSI costs, which are deferred and recorded 
as other assets, relate to sales inducements offered on 
sales to new customers, principally on fixed annuity 
and interest-sensitive life contracts.  These sales 
inducements are primarily in the form of additional 
credits to the customer’s account balance or 
enhancements to interest credited for a specified 
period which are in excess of the rates currently being 
credited to similar contracts without sales 
inducements.  DSI is amortized into income using the 
same methodology and assumptions as DAC and is 
included in interest credited to contractholder funds.  
2017 Annual Report  199
2017 Annual Report  199

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

All other acquisition costs are expensed as incurred 
and included in operating costs and expenses.  

For property and casualty insurance, DAC is 
amortized into income as premiums are earned, 
typically over periods of six or twelve months for 
personal lines policies or generally one to five years for 
protection plans and other contracts (primarily related 
to finance and insurance products), and is included in 
amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs.  DAC 
associated with property and casualty insurance is 
periodically reviewed for recoverability and adjusted if 
necessary.  Future investment income is considered in 
determining the recoverability of DAC. 

For traditional life and voluntary accident and 

health insurance, DAC is amortized over the premium 
paying period of the related policies in proportion to 
the estimated revenues on such business.  
Assumptions used in the amortization of DAC and 
reserve calculations are established at the time the 
policy is issued and are generally not revised during 
the life of the policy.  Any deviations from projected 
business in force resulting from actual policy 
terminations differing from expected levels and any 
estimated premium deficiencies may result in a change 
to the rate of amortization in the period such events 
occur.  Generally, the amortization periods for these 
policies approximates the estimated lives of the 
policies.  The Company periodically reviews the 
recoverability of DAC for these policies using actual 
experience and current assumptions.  Prior to fourth 
quarter 2017, the Company evaluated traditional life 
insurance products and immediate annuities with life 
contingencies on an aggregate basis.  In conjunction 
with the segment changes in fourth quarter 2017, 
traditional life insurance products, immediate annuities 
with life contingencies, and voluntary accident and 
health insurance products are reviewed individually.  If 
actual experience and current assumptions are 
adverse compared to the original assumptions and a 
premium deficiency is determined to exist, any 
remaining unamortized DAC balance would be 
expensed to the extent not recoverable and the 
establishment of a premium deficiency reserve may be 
required.

For interest-sensitive life insurance and fixed 

annuities, DAC and DSI are amortized in proportion to 
the incidence of the total present value of gross profits, 
which includes both actual historical gross profits 
(“AGP”) and estimated future gross profits (“EGP”) 
expected to be earned over the estimated lives of the 
contracts.  The amortization is net of interest on the 
prior period DAC balance using rates established at the 
inception of the contracts.  Actual amortization periods 
generally range from 15-30 years; however, 
incorporating estimates of the rate of customer 
surrenders, partial withdrawals and deaths generally 
results in the majority of the DAC being amortized 
during the surrender charge period, which is typically 
10-20 years for interest-sensitive life and 5-10 years for 
fixed annuities.  The rate of DAC and DSI amortization 
is reestimated and adjusted by a cumulative charge or 
credit to income when there is a difference between 
the incidence of actual versus expected gross profits in 
200  
200

a reporting period or when there is a change in total 
EGP.  When DAC or DSI amortization or a component of 
gross profits for a quarterly period is potentially 
negative (which would result in an increase of the DAC 
or DSI balance) as a result of negative AGP, the specific 
facts and circumstances surrounding the potential 
negative amortization are considered to determine 
whether it is appropriate for recognition in the 
consolidated financial statements.  Negative 
amortization is only recorded when the increased DAC 
or DSI balance is determined to be recoverable based 
on facts and circumstances.  Recapitalization of DAC 
and DSI is limited to the originally deferred costs plus 
interest.

AGP and EGP primarily consist of the following 

components: contract charges for the cost of 
insurance less mortality costs and other benefits; 
investment income and realized capital gains and 
losses less interest credited; and surrender and other 
contract charges less maintenance expenses.  The 
principal assumptions for determining the amount of 
EGP are mortality, persistency, expenses, investment 
returns, including capital gains and losses on assets 
supporting contract liabilities, interest crediting rates 
to contractholders, and the effects of any hedges.  For 
products whose supporting investments are exposed 
to capital losses in excess of the Company’s 
expectations which may cause periodic AGP to become 
temporarily negative, EGP and AGP utilized in DAC and 
DSI amortization may be modified to exclude the 
excess capital losses.

The Company performs quarterly reviews of DAC 

and DSI recoverability for interest-sensitive life and 
fixed annuity contracts using current assumptions.  If a 
change in the amount of EGP is significant, it could 
result in the unamortized DAC or DSI not being 
recoverable, resulting in a charge which is included as a 
component of amortization of deferred policy 
acquisition costs or interest credited to contractholder 
funds, respectively.

The DAC and DSI balances presented include 

adjustments to reflect the amount by which the 
amortization of DAC and DSI would increase or 
decrease if the unrealized capital gains or losses in the 
respective product investment portfolios were actually 
realized.  The adjustments are recorded net of tax in 
AOCI.  DAC, DSI and deferred income taxes determined 
on unrealized capital gains and losses and reported in 
AOCI recognize the impact on shareholders’ equity 
consistently with the amounts that would be 
recognized in the income statement on realized capital 
gains and losses.

Customers of the Company may exchange one 
insurance policy or investment contract for another 
offered by the Company, or make modifications to an 
existing investment, life or property and casualty 
contract issued by the Company.  These transactions 
are identified as internal replacements for accounting 
purposes.  Internal replacement transactions 
determined to result in replacement contracts that are 
substantially unchanged from the replaced contracts 
are accounted for as continuations of the replaced 
contracts.  Unamortized DAC and DSI related to the 

replaced contracts continue to be deferred and 
amortized in connection with the replacement 
contracts.  For interest-sensitive life and investment 
contracts, the EGP of the replacement contracts are 
treated as a revision to the EGP of the replaced 
contracts in the determination of amortization of DAC 
and DSI.  For traditional life and property and casualty 
insurance policies, any changes to unamortized DAC 
that result from replacement contracts are treated as 
prospective revisions.  Any costs associated with the 
issuance of replacement contracts are characterized as 
maintenance costs and expensed as incurred.  Internal 
replacement transactions determined to result in a 
substantial change to the replaced contracts are 
accounted for as an extinguishment of the replaced 
contracts, and any unamortized DAC and DSI related to 
the replaced contracts are eliminated with a 
corresponding charge to amortization of deferred 
policy acquisition costs or interest credited to 
contractholder funds, respectively.

The costs assigned to the right to receive future 

cash flows from certain business purchased from other 
insurers are also classified as DAC in the Consolidated 
Statements of Financial Position.  The costs capitalized 
represent the present value of future profits expected 
to be earned over the lives of the contracts acquired.  
These costs are amortized as profits emerge over the 
lives of the acquired business and are periodically 
evaluated for recoverability.  The present value of 
future profits was $47 million and $53 million as of 
December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  
Amortization expense of the present value of future 
profits was $6 million, $5 million and $8 million in 2017, 
2016 and 2015, respectively.

Reinsurance

In the normal course of business, the Company 

seeks to limit aggregate and single exposure to losses 
on large risks by purchasing reinsurance.  The 
Company has also used reinsurance to effect the 
disposition of certain blocks of business.  The 
Company also participates in various reinsurance 
mechanisms, including industry pools and facilities, 
which are backed by the financial resources of the 
property and casualty insurance company market 
participants.  The amounts reported as reinsurance 
recoverables include amounts billed to reinsurers on 
losses paid as well as estimates of amounts expected 
to be recovered from reinsurers on insurance liabilities 
and contractholder funds that have not yet been paid.  
Reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses are 
estimated based upon assumptions consistent with 
those used in establishing the liabilities related to the 
underlying reinsured contracts.  Insurance liabilities are 
reported gross of reinsurance recoverables.  
Reinsurance premiums are generally reflected in 
income in a manner consistent with the recognition of 
premiums on the reinsured contracts.  For catastrophe 
coverage, the cost of reinsurance premiums is 
recognized ratably over the contract period to the 
extent coverage remains available.  Reinsurance does 
not extinguish the Company’s primary liability under 
the policies written.  Therefore, the Company regularly 
evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers, 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

including their activities with respect to claim 
settlement practices and commutations, and 
establishes allowances for uncollectible reinsurance as 
appropriate.

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of amounts paid for 
acquiring businesses over the fair value of the net 
assets acquired, less any impairment of goodwill 
recognized.  The Company’s goodwill reporting units 
are equivalent to its reportable segments, Allstate 
Protection, Service Businesses, Allstate Life and 
Allstate Benefits to which goodwill has been assigned.

Goodwill is recognized when acquired and 

allocated to reporting units based on which unit is 
expected to benefit from the synergies of the business 
combination.  Goodwill is not amortized but is tested 
for impairment at least annually.  The Company 
performs its annual goodwill impairment testing during 
the fourth quarter of each year based upon data as of 
the close of the third quarter.  The Company also 
reviews goodwill for impairment whenever events or 
changes in circumstances, such as deteriorating or 
adverse market conditions, indicate that it is more 
likely than not that the carrying amount of goodwill 
may exceed its implied fair value.  The goodwill 
impairment analysis is performed at the reporting unit 
level.

In fourth quarter 2017, the Company adopted new 
reportable segments, which required the Company to 
evaluate goodwill, including the allocation of goodwill 
to any new reporting units on a relative fair value basis.  
The reallocation was computed using fair values for the 
goodwill reporting units determined using discounted 
cash flow (“DCF”) calculations and market to book 
multiples derived from a peer company analysis as 
described below.  In conjunction with the reallocation 
of goodwill, the Company recognized $125 million of 
goodwill impairment related to the goodwill allocated 
to the Allstate Annuities reporting unit reflecting a 
market-based valuation.  The fair value of the 
Company’s remaining goodwill reporting units 
exceeded their carrying values.  To periodically 
estimate the fair value of its goodwill reporting units, 
the Company may utilize a combination of widely 
accepted valuation techniques including a stock price 
and market capitalization analysis, DCF calculations 
and market to book multiples derived from a peer 
company analysis.  The stock price and market 
capitalization analysis takes into consideration the 
quoted market price of the Company’s outstanding 
common stock and includes a control premium, 
derived from relevant historical acquisition activity, in 
determining the estimated fair value of the 
consolidated entity before allocating that fair value to 
2017 Annual Report  201
2017 Annual Report  201

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

individual reporting units.  The DCF analysis utilizes 
long term assumptions for revenues, investment 
income, benefits, claims, other operating expenses and 
income taxes to produce projections of both income 
and cash flows available for dividends that are present 
valued using weighted average cost of capital.  Market 
to book multiples represent the mean market to book 
multiple for selected peer companies with operations 
similar to the Company’s goodwill reporting units to 
which the multiple is applied.  The outputs from these 
methods are weighted based on the nature of the 
business and the relative amount of market observable 
assumptions supporting the estimates.  The computed 
values are then weighted to reflect the fair value 
estimate based on the specific attributes of each 
goodwill reporting unit.

Property and equipment

Property and equipment is carried at cost less 

accumulated depreciation.  Included in property and 
equipment are capitalized costs related to computer 
software licenses and software developed for internal 
use.  These costs generally consist of certain external 
payroll and payroll related costs.  Property and 
equipment depreciation is calculated using the 
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of 
the assets, generally 3 to 10 years for equipment and 
40 years for real property.  Depreciation expense is 
reported in operating costs and expenses.  
Accumulated depreciation on property and equipment 
was $2.27 billion and $2.16 billion as of December 31, 
2017 and 2016, respectively.  Depreciation expense on 
property and equipment was $290 million, $267 million 
and $255 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
The Company reviews its property and equipment for 
impairment at least annually and whenever events or 
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying 
amount may not be recoverable.
Income taxes

The income tax provision is calculated under the 

liability method.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
recorded based on the difference between the financial 
statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities at the 
enacted tax rates.  The principal assets and liabilities 
giving rise to such differences are DAC, unearned 
premiums, unrealized capital gains and losses and 
insurance reserves.  A deferred tax asset valuation 
allowance is established when there is uncertainty that 
such assets will be realized.
Reserve for property and casualty insurance claims 
and claims expense

The reserve for property and casualty insurance 

claims and claims expense is the estimate of amounts 
necessary to settle all reported and unreported claims 
for the ultimate cost of insured property and casualty 
losses, based upon the facts of each case and the 
Company’s experience with similar cases.  Estimated 
amounts of salvage and subrogation are deducted 
from the reserve for claims and claims expense.  The 
establishment of appropriate reserves, including 
reserves for catastrophe losses, is an inherently 
uncertain and complex process.  Reserve estimates are 
primarily derived using an actuarial estimation process 
202  

  www.allstate.com

in which historical loss patterns are applied to actual 
paid losses and reported losses (paid losses plus 
individual case reserves established by claim adjusters) 
for an accident or report year to create an estimate of 
how losses are likely to develop over time.  
Development factors are calculated quarterly and 
periodically throughout the year for data elements 
such as claims reported and settled, paid losses, and 
paid losses combined with case reserves.  The 
historical development patterns for these data 
elements are used as the assumptions to calculate 
reserve estimates, including the reserves for reported 
and unreported claims.  Reserve estimates are 
regularly reviewed and updated, using the most 
current information available.  Any resulting 
reestimates are reflected in current results of 
operations.

Reserve for life-contingent contract benefits

The reserve for life-contingent contract benefits 

payable under insurance policies, including traditional 
life insurance, life-contingent immediate annuities and 
voluntary accident and health insurance products, is 
computed on the basis of long-term actuarial 
assumptions of future investment yields, mortality, 
morbidity, policy terminations and expenses.  These 
assumptions, which for traditional life insurance are 
applied using the net level premium method, include 
provisions for adverse deviation and generally vary by 
characteristics such as type of coverage, year of issue 
and policy duration.  The assumptions are established 
at the time the policy is issued and are generally not 
changed during the life of the policy.  The Company 
periodically reviews the adequacy of reserves for these 
policies using actual experience and current 
assumptions.  If actual experience and current 
assumptions are adverse compared to the original 
assumptions and a premium deficiency is determined 
to exist, any remaining unamortized DAC balance 
would be expensed to the extent not recoverable and 
the establishment of a premium deficiency reserve may 
be required.  Prior to fourth quarter 2017, the Company 
evaluated traditional life insurance products and 
immediate annuities with life contingencies on an 
aggregate basis.  In conjunction with the Company’s 
segment changes in fourth quarter 2017, traditional life 
insurance products, immediate annuities with life 
contingencies, and voluntary accident and health 
insurance are reviewed individually.  The Company also 
reviews these policies for circumstances where 
projected profits would be recognized in early years 
followed by projected losses in later years.  If this 
circumstance exists, the Company will accrue a liability, 
during the period of profits, to offset the losses at such 
time as the future losses are expected to commence 
using a method updated prospectively over time.  To 
the extent that unrealized gains on fixed income 
securities would result in a premium deficiency if those 
gains were realized, the related increase in reserves for 
certain immediate annuities with life contingencies is 
recorded net of tax as a reduction of unrealized net 
capital gains included in AOCI.

Contractholder funds

Contractholder funds represent interest-bearing 

liabilities arising from the sale of products such as 
interest-sensitive life insurance, fixed annuities and 
funding agreements.  Contractholder funds primarily 
comprise cumulative deposits received and interest 
credited to the contractholder less cumulative contract 
benefits, surrenders, withdrawals, maturities and 
contract charges for mortality or administrative 
expenses.  Contractholder funds also include reserves 
for secondary guarantees on interest-sensitive life 
insurance and certain fixed annuity contracts and 
reserves for certain guarantees on reinsured variable 
annuity contracts.

Separate accounts

Separate accounts assets are carried at fair value.  

The assets of the separate accounts are legally 
segregated and available only to settle separate 
accounts contract obligations.  Separate accounts 
liabilities represent the contractholders’ claims to the 
related assets and are carried at an amount equal to 
the separate accounts assets.  Investment income and 
realized capital gains and losses of the separate 
accounts accrue directly to the contractholders and 
therefore are not included in the Company’s 
Consolidated Statements of Operations.  Deposits to 
and surrenders and withdrawals from the separate 
accounts are reflected in separate accounts liabilities 
and are not included in consolidated cash flows.

Absent any contract provision wherein the 

Company provides a guarantee, variable annuity and 
variable life insurance contractholders bear the 
investment risk that the separate accounts’ funds may 
not meet their stated investment objectives.  
Substantially all of the Company’s variable annuity 
business was reinsured beginning in 2006.

Legal contingencies

The Company reviews its lawsuits, regulatory 

inquiries, and other legal proceedings on an ongoing 
basis.  The Company establishes accruals for such 
matters at management’s best estimate when the 
Company assesses that it is probable that a loss has 
been incurred and the amount of the loss can be 
reasonably estimated.  The Company’s assessment of 
whether a loss is reasonably possible or probable is 
based on its assessment of the ultimate outcome of 
the matter following all appeals.  The Company does 
not include potential recoveries in its estimates of 
reasonably possible or probable losses.  Legal fees are 
expensed as incurred.

Long-term debt

Long-term debt includes senior notes, senior 
debentures, subordinated debentures and junior 
subordinated debentures issued by the Corporation.  
Unamortized debt issuance costs are reported in long-
term debt and are amortized over the expected period 
the debt will remain outstanding.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

Deferred Employee Stock Ownership Plan (“ESOP”) 
expense

Deferred ESOP expense represents the remaining 

unrecognized cost of shares acquired by the Allstate 
ESOP to pre-fund a portion of the Company’s 
contribution to the Allstate 401(k) Savings Plan.

Equity incentive plans

The Company has equity incentive plans under 

which the Company grants nonqualified stock options, 
restricted stock units and performance stock awards 
(“equity awards”) to certain employees and directors of 
the Company.  The Company measures the fair value of 
equity awards at the award date and recognizes the 
expense over the shorter of the period in which the 
requisite service is rendered or retirement eligibility is 
attained.  The expense for performance stock awards is 
adjusted each period to reflect the performance factor 
most likely to be achieved at the end of the 
performance period.  The Company uses a binomial 
lattice model to determine the fair value of employee 
stock options.

Off-balance sheet financial instruments

Commitments to invest, commitments to purchase 

private placement securities, commitments to extend 
loans, financial guarantees and credit guarantees have 
off-balance sheet risk because their contractual 
amounts are not recorded in the Company’s 
Consolidated Statements of Financial Position (see 
Notes 7 and 14).

Consolidation of variable interest entities (“VIEs”)

The Company consolidates VIEs when it is the 

primary beneficiary.  A primary beneficiary is the 
variable interest holder in a VIE with both the power to 
direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly 
impact the economic performance of the VIE and the 
obligation to absorb losses, or the right to receive 
benefits, that could potentially be significant to the 
VIE.

Foreign currency translation

The local currency of the Company’s foreign 

subsidiaries is deemed to be the functional currency of 
the country in which these subsidiaries operate.  The 
financial statements of the Company’s foreign 
subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the 
exchange rate in effect at the end of a reporting period 
for assets and liabilities and at average exchange rates 
during the period for results of operations.  The 
unrealized gains and losses from the translation of the 
net assets are recorded as unrealized foreign currency 
translation adjustments and included in AOCI.  
Changes in unrealized foreign currency translation 
adjustments are included in other comprehensive 
income.  Gains and losses from foreign currency 
transactions are reported in operating costs and 
expenses and have not been material.

Earnings per common share

Basic earnings per common share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares 

outstanding, including vested unissued participating restricted stock units.  Diluted earnings per common share is 
computed using the weighted average number of common and dilutive potential common shares outstanding.  For the 
Company, dilutive potential common shares consist of outstanding stock options and unvested non-participating 
restricted stock units and contingently issuable performance stock awards.

2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, but were not 
included in the computation of diluted earnings per 
common share in those years.

Adopted accounting standards

Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting

Effective January 1, 2017, the Company adopted 
new Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) 
guidance that amends the accounting for share-based 
payments on a prospective basis.  Under the new 
guidance, reporting entities are required to recognize 
all tax effects related to share-based payments at 
settlement or expiration through the income 
statement and the requirement to delay recognition of 
certain tax benefits until they reduce current taxes 
payable is eliminated.  The new guidance also permits 
employers to withhold shares issued in connection with 
an employee’s exercise of options or the settlement of 
stock awards, up to the employee’s maximum 
individual statutory tax rate, to meet tax withholding 
requirements without causing liability classification of 
the award.  In addition, all tax-related cash flows 
resulting from share-based payments are reported as 
operating activities on the statement of cash flows 
whereas cash payments made to taxing authorities on 
204  
204  

  www.allstate.com
  www.allstate.com

an employee’s behalf for withheld shares are presented 
as financing activities.  The adoption of this guidance 
had no impact on the Company’s results of operations 
or financial position on the date of adoption, but 
resulted in a $63 million benefit to net income 
applicable to common shareholders in 2017. 

Transition to Equity Method Accounting

Effective January 1, 2017, the Company adopted 

new FASB guidance amending the accounting 
requirements for transitioning to the equity method of 
accounting (“EMA”), including a transition from the cost 
method.  The guidance requires the cost of acquiring 
an additional interest in an investee to be added to the 
existing carrying value to establish the initial basis of 
the EMA investment.  Under the new guidance, no 
retroactive adjustment is required when an investment 
initially qualifies for EMA treatment.  The guidance is 
applied prospectively to investments that qualify for 
EMA after application of the cost method of 
accounting.  Accordingly, the adoption of this guidance 
had no impact on the Company’s results of operations 
or financial position.

Application of Income Tax Guidance to Certain U.S. Tax 
Reform Provisions 

In February 2018, the FASB issued guidance 

permitting reclassification of the effects of the new 
corporate tax rate in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 
(“Tax Legislation”) on balances presented net of tax in 
AOCI.  Upon enactment of the Tax Legislation in 
December 2017, existing accounting guidance required 
the revaluation of all deferred tax balances to the 
newly enacted tax rate by adjustment to income tax 
expense whereas a corresponding adjustment of the 

balances presented in AOCI was prohibited. The new 
guidance permits reclassification of the impact of the 
newly enacted tax rates in the Tax Legislation on 
balances presented net of tax in AOCI to retained 
income.  The guidance, which may be adopted for any 
period for which financial statements have not yet 
been issued, is effective for fiscal years beginning after 
December 15, 2018, and may be applied retrospectively 
to the date of enactment or the beginning of a 
reporting period.  The Company elected to early adopt 
the new guidance as of December 31, 2017.  Upon 
adoption of the guidance, amounts are recognized 
after-tax in AOCI using the newly established 21% 
corporate income tax rate.  The net impact of adoption 
was a $49 million increase in AOCI and a corresponding 
decrease in retained income.  The $49 million increase 
in AOCI is comprised of a $290 million increase in 
unrealized net capital gains and losses, a $6 million 
decrease in unrealized foreign currency translation 
adjustment and a $235 million decrease in 
unrecognized pension and other postretirement 
benefit cost.

Pending accounting standards

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

In May 2014, the FASB issued guidance which 

revises the criteria for revenue recognition.  Insurance 
contracts are excluded from the scope of the new 
guidance.  Under the guidance, the transaction price is 
attributed to underlying performance obligations in the 
contract and revenue is recognized as the entity 
satisfies the performance obligations and transfers 
control of a good or service to the customer.  
Incremental costs of obtaining a contract may be 
capitalized to the extent the entity expects to recover 
those costs.  The guidance is effective for reporting 
periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and is to be 
applied either on a full or modified retrospective basis.  

The Company will apply the modified retrospective 

approach as of January 1, 2018, which results in the 
recognition of a cumulative effect of adoption as an 
adjustment to the beginning balance of retained 
income at the date of initial application.  The 
Company’s principal activities impacted by the 
standard are those related to the issuance of 
protection plans for consumer products and 
automobiles and service contracts that provide 
roadside assistance.  The impacts include an increase 
in deferred revenue with a corresponding increase in 
deferred costs for protection plans that are sold 
directly to retailers for which Allstate is deemed to be 
the principal in the transaction.  The anticipated 
impacts of these adjustments offset and will not 
impact net income, but result in an increase in 
unearned premiums and deferred policy acquisition 
costs of approximately $160 million, pre-tax.  The 
Company expects to recognize a cumulative effect 
adjustment related to the accounting for variable 
consideration, the deferral of certain costs associated 
with acquiring service contracts that provide roadside 
assistance, and other items, the net impact of which is 
not expected to materially reduce shareholders’ equity 
at the date of adoption.  Based on the Company’s 
assessment, the total impact of adoption will not be 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

material to the Company’s results of operations or 
financial position.

Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and 
Financial Liabilities

In January 2016, the FASB issued guidance 
requiring equity investments, including equity 
securities and limited partnership interests that are not 
accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
or result in consolidation to be measured at fair value 
with changes in fair value recognized in net income.  
Equity investments without readily determinable fair 
values may be measured at cost minus impairment, if 
any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable 
price changes in orderly transactions for the identical 
or a similar investment of the same issuer.  When a 
qualitative assessment of equity investments without 
readily determinable fair values indicates that an 
impairment exists, the carrying value is required to be 
adjusted to fair value, if lower.  The guidance clarifies 
that an entity should evaluate the realizability of a 
deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale fixed 
income securities in combination with the entity’s other 
deferred tax assets.  The guidance also changes 
certain disclosure requirements.  The guidance is 
effective for interim and annual periods beginning after 
December 15, 2017, and is to be applied through a 
cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning retained 
income which results in no impact to the Company’s 
results of operations at the date of adoption.  

The new guidance related to equity investments 

without readily determinable fair values is applied 
prospectively as of the date of adoption.  The most 
significant impacts relate to the change in accounting 
for equity securities, where $1.16 billion of pre-tax 
unrealized net capital gains will be reclassified on 
January 1, 2018 from AOCI to retained income and cost 
method limited partnership interests (excluding limited 
partnership interests accounted for on a cost recovery 
basis) where the carrying value of these investments 
will increase by approximately $224 million, pre-tax on 
January 1, 2018, with the offsetting after-tax 
adjustment recognized in retained income.  The after-
tax change in accounting for equity securities will not 
affect the Company’s shareholders’ equity and the 
unrealized net capital gains reclassified to retained 
income will never be recognized in net income.  The 
after-tax change in accounting for cost method limited 
partnerships will increase the Company’s shareholders’ 
equity, while also decreasing net income return on 
shareholders’ equity. The amount by which the fair 
value of cost method limited partnerships exceeds 
their carrying value will never be recognized in net 
income, negatively impacting the calculations of 
returns on equity.

Accounting for Leases

In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance 

revising the accounting for leases.  Under the new 
guidance, lessees will be required to recognize a right-
of-use asset and lease liability for all leases other than 
those that meet the definition of a short-term lease.  
The lease liability will be equal to the present value of 
lease payments.  A right-of-use asset will be based on 
2017 Annual Report  205
2017 Annual Report  205

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

the lease liability adjusted for qualifying initial direct 
costs.  Recognition of the lease liability and right-of-
use asset will result in an increase in total assets and 
liabilities in the Consolidated Statement of Financial 
Position.  The expense of operating leases under the 
new guidance will be recognized in the income 
statement on a straight-line basis after combining the 
lease expense components (interest expense on the 
lease liability and amortization of the right-of-use 
asset) over the term of the lease.  For finance leases, 
the expense components are computed separately 
and produce greater up-front expense compared to 
operating leases as interest expense on the lease 
liability is higher in early years and the right-of-use 
asset is amortized on a straight-line basis.  Lease 
classification will be based on criteria similar to those 
currently applied.  The accounting model for lessors 
will be similar to the current model with modifications 
to reflect definition changes for components such as 
initial direct costs.  Lessors will continue to classify 
leases as operating, direct financing, or sales-type.  
The guidance is effective for reporting periods 
beginning after December 15, 2018 using a modified 
retrospective approach applied at the beginning of the 
earliest period presented.  The FASB has exposed for 
comment an optional simplified transition approach 
that would allow application of the transition provisions 
at the effective date instead of the earliest date 
presented.  The Company is in the process of 
evaluating the impact of adoption, which is not 
expected to be material to the Company’s results of 
operations or financial position.

Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments

In June 2016, the FASB issued guidance which 

revises the credit loss recognition criteria for certain 
financial assets measured at amortized cost, including 
reinsurance recoverables.  The new guidance replaces 
the existing incurred loss recognition model with an 
expected loss recognition model.  The objective of the 
expected credit loss model is for the reporting entity to 
recognize its estimate of expected credit losses for 
affected financial assets in a valuation allowance 
deducted from the amortized cost basis of the related 
financial assets that results in presenting the net 
carrying value of the financial assets at the amount 
expected to be collected.  The reporting entity must 
consider all relevant information available when 
estimating expected credit losses, including details 
about past events, current conditions, and reasonable 
and supportable forecasts over the life of an asset.  
Financial assets may be evaluated individually or on a 
pooled basis when they share similar risk 
characteristics.  The measurement of credit losses for 
available-for-sale debt securities measured at fair value 
is not affected except that credit losses recognized are 
limited to the amount by which fair value is below 
amortized cost and the carrying value adjustment is 
recognized through a valuation allowance and not as a 
direct write-down.  The guidance is effective for interim 
and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, 
and for most affected instruments must be adopted 
using a modified retrospective approach, with a 
cumulative effect adjustment recorded to beginning

retained income.  The Company is in the process of 
evaluating the impact of adoption.

Goodwill Impairment

In January 2017, the FASB issued guidance to 

simplify the accounting for goodwill impairment which 
removes the second step of the goodwill impairment 
test that requires a hypothetical purchase price 
allocation.  Under the new guidance, goodwill 
impairment will be measured and recognized as the 
amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value, 
including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, not to exceed 
the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to the 
reporting unit.  The revised guidance does not affect a 
reporting entity’s ability to first assess qualitative 
factors by reporting unit to determine whether to 
perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test.  
The guidance is effective for goodwill impairment tests 
in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with 
early adoption permitted.  The guidance is to be 
applied on a prospective basis, with the effects, if any, 
recognized in net income in the period of adoption.  
The impact to the Company upon adoption is 
dependent upon the excess, if any, of carrying value of 
the Company’s reporting units, including goodwill, over 
their respective fair values, a measure that is not 
currently determinable.

Presentation of Net Periodic Pension and 
Postretirement Benefits Costs

In March 2017, the FASB issued guidance to 

improve the presentation of net periodic pension and 
postretirement benefits costs that requires the service 
cost component to be reported in operating expenses 
together with other employee compensation costs and 
all other components of net periodic pension and 
postretirement benefits costs reported in non-
operating expenses.  If the reporting entity does not 
separately report operating and non-operating 
expenses on the statement of operations it is required 
to identify, on the statement of operations or in 
disclosures, the line items in which the components of 
net periodic pension and postretirement benefits costs 
are presented.  The new guidance permits only the 
service cost component to be eligible for capitalization 
where applicable.  The guidance is effective for annual 
periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and for 
interim periods within those annual periods.  The 
guidance is to be applied on a prospective basis for 
capitalization of service costs where applicable and on 
a retrospective basis for the presentation of the service 
cost and other components of net periodic pension 
benefit costs in the statements of operations or in 
disclosures.  The impact of adoption is not expected to 
be material to the Company’s results of operations or 
financial position.

Accounting for Hedging Activities

In August 2017, the FASB issued amendments 
intended to better align hedge accounting with an 
organization’s risk management activities.  The 
amendments expand hedge accounting for 
nonfinancial and financial risk components and revise 
the measurement methodologies to better align with 
an organization’s risk management activities.  Separate 

presentation of hedge ineffectiveness is eliminated to 
provide greater transparency of the full impact of 
hedging by requiring presentation of the results of the 
hedged item and hedging instrument in a single 
financial statement line item.  In addition, the 
amendments reduce complexity by simplifying the 
manner in which assessments of hedge effectiveness 
may be performed.  The guidance is effective for 

Note 3 Acquisition

On January 3, 2017, the Company acquired 

SquareTrade Holding Company, Inc. (“SquareTrade”), a 
consumer product protection plan provider that 
distributes through many of America’s major retailers 
and Europe’s mobile operators, for $1.4 billion in cash.  
SquareTrade is a provider of consumer electronics and 
appliance protection plans, covering products 
including TVs, smartphones and computers.  This 
acquisition broadens Allstate’s unique product 
offerings to better meet consumers’ needs. 

In connection with the acquisition, the Company 

recorded goodwill of $1.09 billion, commissions paid to 
retailers (reported in deferred policy acquisition costs) 
of $66 million, other intangible assets (reported in 
other assets) of $555 million, contractual liability 
insurance policy premium expenses (reported in other 
assets) of $205 million, unearned premiums of $389 
million, and net deferred income tax liability of $138 
million.  These amounts reflect re-measurement 
adjustments to the fair value of the opening balance 
sheet assets and liabilities. 

Of the $555 million assigned to other intangible 

assets, $465 million is attributable to acquired 
customer relationships.  The value of the customer 

Note 4 Reportable Segments

Beginning in fourth quarter 2017, the Company’s 

chief operating decision maker reviews financial 
performance and makes decisions about the allocation 
of resources based on the following seven reportable 
segments: Allstate Protection, Discontinued Lines and 
Coverages, Service Businesses, Allstate Life, Allstate 
Benefits, Allstate Annuities, and Corporate and Other.  
These segments are described below and align with 
the Company’s key product and service offerings, 
including the acquisition of SquareTrade and the 
strategic focus and expansion of Arity and other 
service businesses.

Allstate Protection principally offers private 

passenger auto and homeowners insurance in the 
United States and Canada, with earned premiums 
accounting for 82% of Allstate’s 2017 consolidated 
revenues.  Allstate Protection is authorized to sell 
certain property and casualty products in all 50 states, 
the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Canada.  For 
2017, the top U.S. geographic locations for premiums 
earned by the Allstate Protection segment were Texas, 
California, New York and Florida.  No other jurisdiction 
accounted for more than 5% of premium earned for 
Allstate Protection.  Revenues from external customers 
generated outside the United States were $1.11 billion,

for interim periods within those annual periods.  The 
presentation and disclosure guidance is effective on a 
prospective basis.  The impact of adoption is not 
expected to be material to the Company’s results of 
operations or financial position.

relationships intangible asset was determined using an 
income approach that considered cash flows and 
profits expected to be generated by the acquired 
relationships, a discount rate reflecting the relative risk 
of achieving the anticipated cash flows and profits and 
the time value of money, and other factors.  The 
estimated useful life of the customer relationship 
intangible asset is 10 years.  The $555 million assigned 
to other intangible assets also included $69 million 
assigned to the SquareTrade trade name which is 
considered to have an indefinite useful life.  The 
amortization expense of intangible assets in 2017 was 
$92 million.

$1.06 billion and $1.03 billion in 2017, 2016 and 2015, 
respectively. 

Discontinued Lines and Coverages includes 
property and casualty insurance coverage that 
primarily relates to policies written during the 1960s 
through the mid-1980s.  Our exposure to asbestos, 
environmental and other discontinued lines claims 
arises principally from direct excess commercial 
insurance, assumed reinsurance coverage, direct 
primary commercial insurance and other businesses in 
run-off.

Service Businesses comprise SquareTrade, Arity, 

Allstate Roadside Services and Allstate Dealer Services 
and offer consumer product protection plans, device 
and mobile data collection services and analytic 
solutions, roadside assistance, and finance and 
insurance products (including vehicle service contracts, 
guaranteed asset protection waivers, road hazard tire 
and wheel and paintless dent repair protection).  The 
Service Businesses primarily operate in the U.S., with 
certain businesses offering services in Europe, Canada 
and Puerto Rico.  Revenues from external customers 
generated outside the United States relate to 
consumer product protection plans sold primarily in 
the European Union and were $35 million in 2017.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Allstate Life offers traditional, interest-sensitive 
and variable life insurance products.  Allstate Life is 
authorized to sell life insurance products in all 50 
states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.  For 
2017, the top geographic locations for statutory direct 
life insurance premiums were New York, California, 
Texas, Florida and Illinois.  No other jurisdiction 
accounted for more than 5% of statutory direct life 
insurance premiums. 

Allstate Benefits offers voluntary benefits products, 

including life, accident, critical illness, short-term 
disability and other health products.  Allstate Benefits 
is authorized to sell its products in all 50 states, the 
District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin 
Islands, Guam and Canada.  For 2017, the top 
geographic locations for statutory direct accident and 
health insurance premiums were Florida, Texas, North 
Carolina and Georgia.  No other jurisdiction accounted 
for more than 5% of statutory direct accident and 
health insurance premiums. Revenues from external 
customers generated outside the United States relate 
to voluntary accident and health insurance sold in 
Canada and were not material.

Allstate Annuities consists of deferred fixed 

annuities and immediate annuities (including standard 
and sub-standard structured settlements).  This 
segment is in run-off.  The Company also previously 
offered institutional products consisting of funding 
agreements sold to unaffiliated trusts that used them 
to back medium-term notes.  There were no 
institutional products outstanding as of December 31, 
2017 or 2016. 

Corporate and Other comprises holding company 

activities and certain non-insurance operations.

Allstate Protection and Discontinued Lines and 

Coverages segments comprise Property-Liability.  The 
Company does not allocate investment income, 
realized capital gains and losses, or assets to the 
Allstate Protection and Discontinued Lines and 
Coverages segments.  Management reviews assets at 
the Property-Liability, Service Businesses, Allstate Life, 
Allstate Benefits, Allstate Annuities, and Corporate and 
Other levels for decision-making purposes. 

The accounting policies of the reportable 

segments are the same as those described in Note 2.  

The effects of intersegment transactions are 
eliminated in the segment results, except for services 
provided by the Service Businesses to Allstate 
Protection that are not eliminated as management 
considers those transactions in assessing the results of 
the respective segments.

Measuring segment profit or loss

The measure of segment profit or loss used in 

evaluating performance is underwriting income for the 
Allstate Protection and Discontinued Lines and 
Coverages segments and adjusted net income for the 
Service Businesses, Allstate Life, Allstate Benefits, 
Allstate Annuities, and Corporate and Other segments.  
A reconciliation of these measures to net income 
applicable to common shareholders is provided below.

Underwriting income is calculated as premiums 
earned, less claims and claims expenses (“losses”), 
amortization of DAC, operating costs and expenses, 
and restructuring and related charges as determined 
using GAAP.

Adjusted net income is net income applicable to 

common shareholders, excluding:

•  Realized capital gains and losses, after-tax, except for 

periodic settlements and accruals on non-hedge 
derivative instruments, which are reported with realized 
capital gains and losses but included in adjusted net 
income

•  Valuation changes on embedded derivatives not 

hedged, after-tax

•  Amortization of DAC and DSI, to the extent they 

resulted from the recognition of certain realized capital 
gains and losses or valuation changes on embedded 
derivatives not hedged, after-tax

•  Business combination expenses and the amortization 

of purchased intangible assets, after-tax

•  Gain (loss) on disposition of operations, after-tax
•  Adjustments for other significant non-recurring, 

infrequent or unusual items, when (a) the nature of the 
charge or gain is such that it is reasonably unlikely to 
recur within two years, or (b) there has been no similar 
charge or gain within the prior two years

Interest expense is primarily incurred in the Corporate and Other segment.  Capital expenditures for long-lived 

assets are generally made in Property-Liability as the Company does not allocate assets to the Allstate Protection and 
Discontinued Lines and Coverages segments.  A portion of these long-lived assets are used by entities included in the 
Service Businesses, Allstate Life, Allstate Benefits, Allstate Annuities and Corporate and Other segments and, 
accordingly, are charged to expenses in proportion to their use.

The Company uses its best estimate of future cash 

flows expected to be collected from the fixed income 
security, discounted at the security’s original or current 
effective rate, as appropriate, to calculate a recovery 
value and determine whether a credit loss exists.  The 
determination of cash flow estimates is inherently 
subjective and methodologies may vary depending on 
facts and circumstances specific to the security.  All 
reasonably available information relevant to the 
collectability of the security, including past events, 
current conditions, and reasonable and supportable 
assumptions and forecasts, are considered when 
developing the estimate of cash flows expected to be 
collected.  That information generally includes, but is 
not limited to, the remaining payment terms of the 
security, prepayment speeds, foreign exchange rates, 
the financial condition and future earnings potential of

the issue or issuer, expected defaults, expected 
recoveries, the value of underlying collateral, vintage, 
geographic concentration of underlying collateral, 
available reserves or escrows, current subordination 
levels, third party guarantees and other credit 
enhancements.  Other information, such as industry 
analyst reports and forecasts, sector credit ratings, 
financial condition of the bond insurer for insured fixed 
income securities, and other market data relevant to 
the realizability of contractual cash flows, may also be 
considered.  The estimated fair value of collateral will 
be used to estimate recovery value if the Company 
determines that the security is dependent on the 
liquidation of collateral for ultimate settlement.  If the 
estimated recovery value is less than the amortized 
cost of the security, a credit loss exists and an other-
than-temporary impairment for the difference between 

the estimated recovery value and amortized cost is 
recorded in earnings.  The portion of the unrealized 
loss related to factors other than credit remains 
classified in AOCI.  If the Company determines that the 
fixed income security does not have sufficient cash

the equity security’s decline in fair value is considered 
other than temporary and is recorded in earnings.

For fixed income and equity securities managed by 

third parties, either the Company has contractually 
retained its decision making authority as it pertains to 
selling securities that are in an unrealized loss position 
or it recognizes any unrealized loss at the end of the 
period through a charge to earnings.

The Company’s portfolio monitoring process 

includes a quarterly review of all securities to identify 
instances where the fair value of a security compared 
to its amortized cost (for fixed income securities) or 
cost (for equity securities) is below established 
thresholds.  The process also includes the monitoring 
of other impairment indicators such as ratings, ratings 
downgrades and payment defaults.  The securities 
identified, in addition to other securities for which the 
Company may have a concern, are evaluated for 
potential other-than-temporary impairment using all 
reasonably available information relevant to the 
collectability or recovery of the security.  Inherent in 
the Company’s evaluation of other-than-temporary 
impairment for these fixed income and equity 
securities are assumptions and estimates about the 
financial condition and future earnings potential of the 
issue or issuer.  Some of the factors that may be 
considered in evaluating whether a decline in fair value 
is other than temporary are: 1) the financial condition, 
near-term and long-term prospects of the issue or 
issuer, including relevant industry specific market 
conditions and trends, geographic location and 
implications of rating agency actions and offering 
prices; 2) the specific reasons that a security is in an 
unrealized loss position, including overall market 
conditions which could affect liquidity; and 3) the 
length of time and extent to which the fair value has 
been less than amortized cost or cost.

Portfolio monitoring

The Company has a comprehensive portfolio 

monitoring process to identify and evaluate each fixed 
income and equity security whose carrying value may 
be other-than-temporarily impaired.

For each fixed income security in an unrealized loss 
position, the Company assesses whether management 
with the appropriate authority has made the decision 
to sell or whether it is more likely than not the 
Company will be required to sell the security before 
recovery of the amortized cost basis for reasons such 
as liquidity, contractual or regulatory purposes.  If a 
security meets either of these criteria, the security’s 
decline in fair value is considered other than temporary 
and is recorded in earnings.

If the Company has not made the decision to sell 
the fixed income security and it is not more likely than 
not the Company will be required to sell the fixed 
income security before recovery of its amortized cost 
basis, the Company evaluates whether it expects to 
receive cash flows sufficient to recover the entire 
amortized cost basis of the security.  The Company 
calculates the estimated recovery value by discounting 
the best estimate of future cash flows at the security’s 
original or current effective rate, as appropriate, and 
compares this to the amortized cost of the security.  If 
the Company does not expect to receive cash flows 
sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis of 
the fixed income security, the credit loss component of 
the impairment is recorded in earnings, with the 
remaining amount of the unrealized loss related to 
other factors recognized in other comprehensive 
income.

For equity securities, the Company considers 

various factors, including whether it has the intent and 
ability to hold the equity security for a period of time 
sufficient to recover its cost basis.  Where the 
Company lacks the intent and ability to hold to 
recovery, or believes the recovery period is extended,

As of December 31, 2017, $269 million of the $295 
million unrealized losses are related to securities with 
an unrealized loss position less than 20% of amortized 
cost or cost, the degree of which suggests that these 
securities do not pose a high risk of being other-than-
temporarily impaired.  Of the $269 million, $219 million 
are related to unrealized losses on investment grade 
fixed income securities and $11 million are related to 
equity securities.  Of the remaining $39 million, $22 
million have been in an unrealized loss position for less 
than 12 months.  Investment grade is defined as a 
security having a rating of Aaa, Aa, A or Baa from 
Moody’s, a rating of AAA, AA, A or BBB from S&P Global 
Ratings (“S&P”), a comparable rating from another 
nationally recognized rating agency, or a comparable 
internal rating if an externally provided rating is not 
available.  Market prices for certain securities may have 
credit spreads which imply higher or lower credit 
quality than the current third party rating.  Unrealized 
losses on investment grade securities are principally 
related to an increase in market yields which may 

include increased risk-free interest rates and/or wider 
credit spreads since the time of initial purchase.

As of December 31, 2017, the remaining $26 million 

of unrealized losses are related to securities in 
unrealized loss positions greater than or equal to 20% 
of amortized cost or cost.  Investment grade fixed 
income securities comprising $13 million of these 
unrealized losses were evaluated based on factors 
such as discounted cash flows and the financial 
condition and near-term and long-term prospects of 
the issue or issuer and were determined to have 
adequate resources to fulfill contractual obligations.  
Of the $26 million, $12 million are related to below 
investment grade fixed income securities and $1 million 
are related to equity securities.  Of these amounts, $2 
million are related to below investment grade fixed 
income securities that had been in an unrealized loss 
position greater than or equal to 20% of amortized cost 
for a period of twelve or more consecutive months as 
of December 31, 2017.

2017 Annual Report  217
2017 Annual Report  217

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

ABS, RMBS and CMBS in an unrealized loss 

position were evaluated based on actual and projected 
collateral losses relative to the securities’ positions in 
the respective securitization trusts, security specific 
expectations of cash flows, and credit ratings.  This 
evaluation also takes into consideration credit 
enhancement, measured in terms of (i) subordination 
from other classes of securities in the trust that are 
contractually obligated to absorb losses before the 
class of security the Company owns, and (ii) the 
expected impact of other structural features 
embedded in the securitization trust beneficial to the 
class of securities the Company owns, such as 
overcollateralization and excess spread.  Municipal 
bonds in an unrealized loss position were evaluated 
based on the underlying credit quality of the primary 
obligor, obligation type and quality of the underlying 
assets.  Unrealized losses on equity securities are 
primarily related to temporary equity market 
fluctuations of securities that are expected to recover.

As of December 31, 2017, the Company has not 

made the decision to sell and it is not more likely than 
not the Company will be required to sell fixed income 
securities with unrealized losses before recovery of the 
amortized cost basis.  As of December 31, 2017, the 
Company had the intent and ability to hold equity 
securities with unrealized losses for a period of time 
sufficient for them to recover.

Limited partnerships

As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the carrying 
value of equity method limited partnerships totaled 
$5.41 billion and $4.53 billion, respectively.  Principal 
factors influencing carrying value appreciation or 
decline include operating performance, comparable 
public company earnings multiples, capitalization rates 
and the economic environment.  The Company 
recognizes an impairment loss for equity method 
limited partnerships when evidence demonstrates that 
the loss is other than temporary.  Evidence of a loss in 
value that is other than temporary may include the 
absence of an ability to recover the carrying amount of 

the investment or the inability of the investee to 
sustain a level of earnings that would justify the 
carrying amount of the investment.

As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the carrying 

value for cost method limited partnerships was $1.33 
billion and $1.28 billion, respectively.  To determine if an 
other-than-temporary impairment has occurred, the 
Company evaluates whether an impairment indicator 
has occurred in the period that may have a significant 
adverse effect on the carrying value of the investment.  
Impairment indicators may include: significantly 
reduced valuations of the investments held by the 
limited partnerships; actual recent cash flows received 
being significantly less than expected cash flows; 
reduced valuations based on financing completed at a 
lower value; completed sale of a material underlying 
investment at a price significantly lower than expected; 
or any other adverse events since the last financial 
statements received that might affect the fair value of 
the investee’s capital.  Additionally, the Company’s 
portfolio monitoring process includes a quarterly 
review of all cost method limited partnerships to 
identify instances where the net asset value is below 
established thresholds for certain periods of time, as 
well as investments that are performing below 
expectations, for further impairment consideration.  If a 
cost method limited partnership is other-than-
temporarily impaired, the carrying value is written 
down to fair value, generally estimated to be 
equivalent to the reported net asset value.

Mortgage loans

The Company’s mortgage loans are commercial 

mortgage loans collateralized by a variety of 
commercial real estate property types located across 
the United States and totaled, net of valuation 
allowance, $4.53 billion and $4.49 billion as of 
December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  
Substantially all of the commercial mortgage loans are 
non-recourse to the borrower.

Mortgage loans are evaluated for impairment on a 

specific loan basis through a quarterly credit 
monitoring process and review of key credit quality 
indicators.  Mortgage loans are considered impaired 
when it is probable that the Company will not collect 
the contractual principal and interest.  Valuation 
allowances are established for impaired loans to 
reduce the carrying value to the fair value of the 
collateral less costs to sell or the present value of the 
loan’s expected future repayment cash flows 
discounted at the loan’s original effective interest rate.  
Impaired mortgage loans may not have a valuation 
allowance when the fair value of the collateral less 
costs to sell is higher than the carrying value.  
Valuation allowances are adjusted for subsequent 
changes in the fair value of the collateral less costs to 
sell or present value of the loan’s expected future 
repayment cash flows.  Mortgage loans are charged off 
against their corresponding valuation allowances when 
there is no reasonable expectation of recovery.  The 
impairment evaluation is non-statistical in respect to

the aggregate portfolio but considers facts and 
circumstances attributable to each loan.  It is not 
considered probable that additional impairment losses, 
beyond those identified on a specific loan basis, have 
been incurred as of December 31, 2017.

Accrual of income is suspended for mortgage loans 

that are in default or when full and timely collection of 
principal and interest payments is not probable.  Cash 
receipts on mortgage loans on nonaccrual status are 
generally recorded as a reduction of carrying value.

Debt service coverage ratio is considered a key 

credit quality indicator when mortgage loans are 
evaluated for impairment.  Debt service coverage ratio 
represents the amount of estimated cash flows from 
the property available to the borrower to meet 
principal and interest payment obligations.  Debt 
service coverage ratio estimates are updated annually 
or more frequently if conditions are warranted based 
on the Company’s credit monitoring process.

Mortgage loans with a debt service coverage ratio below 1.0 that are not considered impaired primarily relate to 

instances where the borrower has the financial capacity to fund the revenue shortfalls from the properties for the 
foreseeable term, the decrease in cash flows from the properties is considered temporary, or there are other risk 
mitigating circumstances such as additional collateral, escrow balances or borrower guarantees.

Note 6

Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities

Fair value is defined as the price that would be 

received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in 
an orderly transaction between market participants at 
the measurement date.  The hierarchy for inputs used 
in determining fair value maximizes the use of 
observable inputs and minimizes the use of 
unobservable inputs by requiring that observable 
inputs be used when available.  Assets and liabilities 
recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial 
Position at fair value are categorized in the fair value 
hierarchy based on the observability of inputs to the 
valuation techniques as follows:

Level 1:  Assets and liabilities whose values are based 
on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or 
liabilities in an active market that the Company can 
access.

Level 2:  Assets and liabilities whose values are based 
on the following:

  www.allstate.com

Included in fixed income securities are below 
investment grade assets totaling $7.57 billion and 
$8.62 billion as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, 
respectively.

As of December 31, 2017, fixed income securities 
and short-term investments with a carrying value of 
$154 million were on deposit with regulatory authorities 
as required by law.

As of December 31, 2017, the carrying value of fixed 

income securities and other investments that were 
non-income producing was $51 million.

(a) Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in 

active markets;

(b) Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or 

liabilities in markets that are not active; or

(c)  Valuation models whose inputs are observable, 

directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term 
of the asset or liability.

Level 3: Assets and liabilities whose values are based 
on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs 
that are both unobservable and significant to the 
overall fair value measurement.  Unobservable inputs 
reflect the Company’s estimates of the assumptions 
that market participants would use in valuing the 
assets and liabilities.

The availability of observable inputs varies by 

instrument.  In situations where fair value is based on 
internally developed pricing models or inputs that are 
unobservable in the market, the determination of fair 

value requires more judgment.  The degree of 
judgment exercised by the Company in determining fair 
value is typically greatest for instruments categorized 
in Level 3.  In many instances, valuation inputs used to 
measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair 
value hierarchy.  The category level in the fair value 
hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input 
that is significant to the fair value measurement in its 
entirety.  The Company uses prices and inputs that are 
current as of the measurement date, including during 
periods of market disruption.  In periods of market 
disruption, the ability to observe prices and inputs may 
be reduced for many instruments.

The Company is responsible for the determination 

of fair value and the supporting assumptions and 
methodologies.  The Company gains assurance that 
assets and liabilities are appropriately valued through 
the execution of various processes and controls 
designed to ensure the overall reasonableness and 
consistent application of valuation methodologies, 
including inputs and assumptions, and compliance with 
accounting standards.  For fair values received from 
third parties or internally estimated, the Company’s 
processes and controls are designed to ensure that the 
valuation methodologies are appropriate and 
consistently applied, the inputs and assumptions are 
reasonable and consistent with the objective of 
determining fair value, and the fair values are 
accurately recorded.  For example, on a continuing 
basis, the Company assesses the reasonableness of 
individual fair values that have stale security prices or 
that exceed certain thresholds as compared to previous 
fair values received from valuation service providers or 
brokers or derived from internal models.  The Company 
performs procedures to understand and assess the 
methodologies, processes and controls of valuation 
service providers.  In addition, the Company may 
validate the reasonableness of fair values by comparing 
information obtained from valuation service providers 
or brokers to other third party valuation sources for 
selected securities.  The Company performs ongoing 
price validation procedures such as back-testing of 
actual sales, which corroborate the various inputs used 
in internal models to market observable data.  When 
fair value determinations are expected to be more 
variable, the Company validates them through reviews 
by members of management who have relevant 
expertise and who are independent of those charged 
with executing investment transactions.

The Company has two types of situations where 
investments are classified as Level 3 in the fair value 
hierarchy.  The first is where specific inputs significant 
to the fair value estimation models are not market 
observable.  This primarily occurs in the Company’s use 
of broker quotes to value certain securities where the 
inputs have not been corroborated to be market 
observable, and the use of valuation models that use 
significant non-market observable inputs.  The second 
situation where the Company classifies securities in 
Level 3 is where quotes continue to be received from 
independent third-party valuation service providers and 
all significant inputs are market observable; however, 
there has been a significant decrease in the volume and 
level of activity for the asset when compared to normal 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

market activity such that the degree of market 
observability has declined to a point where 
categorization as a Level 3 measurement is considered 
appropriate.  The indicators considered in determining 
whether a significant decrease in the volume and level 
of activity for a specific asset has occurred include the 
level of new issuances in the primary market, trading 
volume in the secondary market, the level of credit 
spreads over historical levels, applicable bid-ask 
spreads, and price consensus among market 
participants and other pricing sources.

Certain assets are not carried at fair value on a 

recurring basis, including investments such as 
mortgage loans, cost method limited partnership 
interests, bank loans, agent loans and policy loans.  
Accordingly, such investments are only included in the 
fair value hierarchy disclosure when the investment is 
subject to remeasurement at fair value after initial 
recognition and the resulting remeasurement is 
reflected in the consolidated financial statements.

In determining fair value, the Company principally 

uses the market approach which generally utilizes 
market transaction data for the same or similar 
instruments.  To a lesser extent, the Company uses the 
income approach which involves determining fair values 
from discounted cash flow methodologies.  For the 
majority of Level 2 and Level 3 valuations, a 
combination of the market and income approaches is 
used.

Summary of significant valuation techniques for 
assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a 
recurring basis

Level 1 measurements

•  Fixed income securities:  Comprise certain U.S. 
Treasury fixed income securities.  Valuation is 
based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical 
assets in active markets that the Company can 
access.

•  Equity securities:  Comprise actively traded, 

exchange-listed equity securities.  Valuation is 
based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical 
assets in active markets that the Company can 
access.

•  Short-term:  Comprise U.S. Treasury bills valued 
based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical 
assets in active markets that the Company can 
access and actively traded money market funds 
that have daily quoted net asset values for identical 
assets that the Company can access.

•  Separate account assets:  Comprise actively traded 

mutual funds that have daily quoted net asset 
values for identical assets that the Company can 
access.  Net asset values for the actively traded 
mutual funds in which the separate account assets 
are invested are obtained daily from the fund 
managers.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Level 2 measurements

•  Fixed income securities:

U.S. government and agencies:  The primary inputs 
to the valuation include quoted prices for identical 
or similar assets in markets that are not active, 
contractual cash flows, benchmark yields and credit 
spreads.

Municipal:  The primary inputs to the valuation 
include quoted prices for identical or similar assets 
in markets that are not active, contractual cash 
flows, benchmark yields and credit spreads.

Corporate - public:  The primary inputs to the 
valuation include quoted prices for identical or 
similar assets in markets that are not active, 
contractual cash flows, benchmark yields and credit 
spreads. 

Corporate - privately placed:  Valued using a 
discounted cash flow model that is widely accepted 
in the financial services industry and uses market 
observable inputs and inputs derived principally 
from, or corroborated by, observable market data.  
The primary inputs to the discounted cash flow 
model include an interest rate yield curve, as well 
as published credit spreads for similar assets in 
markets that are not active that incorporate the 
credit quality and industry sector of the issuer.

Foreign government:  The primary inputs to the 
valuation include quoted prices for identical or 
similar assets in markets that are not active, 
contractual cash flows, benchmark yields and credit 
spreads.

ABS - collateralized debt obligations (“CDO”) and 
ABS - consumer and other:  The primary inputs to 
the valuation include quoted prices for identical or 
similar assets in markets that are not active, 
contractual cash flows, benchmark yields, 
prepayment speeds, collateral performance and 
credit spreads.  Certain ABS - CDO and ABS - 
consumer and other are valued based on non-
binding broker quotes whose inputs have been 
corroborated to be market observable.

RMBS:  The primary inputs to the valuation include 
quoted prices for identical or similar assets in 
markets that are not active, contractual cash flows, 
benchmark yields, prepayment speeds, collateral 
performance and credit spreads. 

CMBS:  The primary inputs to the valuation include 
quoted prices for identical or similar assets in 
markets that are not active, contractual cash flows, 
benchmark yields, collateral performance and 
credit spreads.

Redeemable preferred stock:  The primary inputs to 
the valuation include quoted prices for identical or 
similar assets in markets that are not active, 
contractual cash flows, benchmark yields, 
underlying stock prices and credit spreads.

•  Equity securities:  The primary inputs to the 

valuation include quoted prices or quoted net asset 

222

values for identical or similar assets in markets that 
are not active.

•  Short-term:  The primary inputs to the valuation 

include quoted prices for identical or similar assets 
in markets that are not active, contractual cash 
flows, benchmark yields and credit spreads.  For 
certain short-term investments, amortized cost is 
used as the best estimate of fair value.

•  Other investments:  Free-standing exchange listed 
derivatives that are not actively traded are valued 
based on quoted prices for identical instruments in 
markets that are not active.
Over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives, including 
interest rate swaps, foreign currency swaps, foreign 
exchange forward contracts, certain options and 
certain credit default swaps, are valued using 
models that rely on inputs such as interest rate 
yield curves, implied volatilities, currency rates, and 
credit spreads that are observable for substantially 
the full term of the contract.  The valuation 
techniques underlying the models are widely 
accepted in the financial services industry and do 
not involve significant judgment.

Level 3 measurements

•  Fixed income securities:

Municipal:  Comprise municipal bonds that are not 
rated by third party credit rating agencies.  The 
primary inputs to the valuation of these municipal 
bonds include quoted prices for identical or similar 
assets in markets that exhibit less liquidity relative 
to those markets supporting Level 2 fair value 
measurements, contractual cash flows, benchmark 
yields and credit spreads.  Also included are 
municipal bonds valued based on non-binding 
broker quotes where the inputs have not been 
corroborated to be market observable and 
municipal bonds in default valued based on the 
present value of expected cash flows. 
Corporate - public and Corporate - privately 
placed:  Primarily valued based on non-binding 
broker quotes where the inputs have not been 
corroborated to be market observable.  Other 
inputs include an interest rate yield curve, as well 
as published credit spreads for similar assets that 
incorporate the credit quality and industry sector of 
the issuer.
ABS - CDO, ABS - consumer and other, RMBS and 
CMBS:  Valued based on non-binding broker quotes 
received from brokers who are familiar with the 
investments and where the inputs have not been 
corroborated to be market observable.

•  Equity securities:  The primary inputs to the 

valuation include quoted prices or quoted net asset 
values for identical or similar assets in markets that 
exhibit less liquidity relative to those markets 
supporting Level 2 fair value measurements.

•  Other investments:  Certain OTC derivatives, such 
as interest rate caps, certain credit default swaps 
and certain options (including swaptions), are 
valued using models that are widely accepted in 

the financial services industry.  These are 
categorized as Level 3 as a result of the 
significance of non-market observable inputs such 
as volatility.  Other primary inputs include interest 
rate yield curves and credit spreads.

•  Contractholder funds:  Derivatives embedded in 

certain life and annuity contracts are valued 
internally using models widely accepted in the 
financial services industry that determine a single 
best estimate of fair value for the embedded 
derivatives within a block of contractholder 
liabilities.  The models primarily use stochastically 
determined cash flows based on the contractual 
elements of embedded derivatives, projected 
option cost and applicable market data, such as 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

interest rate yield curves and equity index volatility 
assumptions.  These are categorized as Level 3 as a 
result of the significance of non-market observable 
inputs.

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-
recurring basis

Mortgage loans written-down to fair value in 

connection with recognizing impairments are valued 
based on the fair value of the underlying collateral less 
costs to sell.  Limited partnership interests written-
down to fair value in connection with recognizing other-

The embedded derivatives are equity-indexed and 

forward starting options in certain life and annuity 
products that provide customers with interest crediting 
rates based on the performance of the S&P 500.  If the 
projected option cost increased (decreased), it would 
result in a higher (lower) liability fair value.  

As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, Level 3 fair value 

measurements of fixed income securities total $606 
million and $558 million, respectively, and include $271 
million and $307 million, respectively, of securities 
valued based on non-binding broker quotes where the 
inputs have not been corroborated to be market 
observable and $58 million and $80 million, 

respectively, of municipal fixed income securities that 
are not rated by third party credit rating agencies.  The 
Company does not develop the unobservable inputs 
used in measuring fair value; therefore, these are not 
included in the table above.  However, an increase 
(decrease) in credit spreads for fixed income securities 
valued based on non-binding broker quotes would 
result in a lower (higher) fair value, and an increase 
(decrease) in the credit rating of municipal bonds that 
are not rated by third party credit rating agencies 
would result in a higher (lower) fair value.

Transfers between level categorizations may occur 
due to changes in the availability of market observable 
inputs, which generally are caused by changes in 
228  
228  

  www.allstate.com
  www.allstate.com

market conditions such as liquidity, trading volume or 
bid-ask spreads.  Transfers between level 
categorizations may also occur due to changes in the 

valuation source.  For example, in situations where a fair 
value quote is not provided by the Company’s 
independent third-party valuation service provider and 
as a result the price is stale or has been replaced with a 
broker quote whose inputs have not been corroborated 
to be market observable, the security is transferred into 
Level 3.  Transfers in and out of level categorizations 
are reported as having occurred at the beginning of the 
quarter in which the transfer occurred.  Therefore, for all 
transfers into Level 3, all realized and changes in 
unrealized gains and losses in the quarter of transfer 
are reflected in the Level 3 rollforward table.

There were no transfers between Level 1 and 

Level 2 during 2017, 2016 or 2015. 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

Transfers into Level 3 during 2017, 2016 and 2015 
included situations where a fair value quote was not 
provided by the Company’s independent third-party 
valuation service provider and as a result the price was 
stale or had been replaced with a broker quote where 
the inputs had not been corroborated to be market 
observable resulting in the security being classified as 
Level 3.  Transfers out of Level 3 during 2017, 2016 and 
2015 included situations where a broker quote was 
used in the prior period and a fair value quote became 
available from the Company’s independent third-party 
valuation service provider in the current period.  A 
quote utilizing the new pricing source was not available 
as of the prior period, and any gains or losses related to 
the change in valuation source for individual securities 
were not significant.

assets and liabilities, cost method limited partnerships (excluding limited partnership interests accounted for on a cost recovery 
basis) will be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income.  The existing carrying value of these 
investments will increase to fair value with the offsetting adjustment recognized in retained income through a cumulative effect 
adjustment.  See Note 2 for additional details on the new accounting standard.

The fair value of mortgage loans is based on 

discounted contractual cash flows or, if the loans are 
impaired due to credit reasons, the fair value of 
collateral less costs to sell.  Risk adjusted discount 
rates are selected using current rates at which similar 
loans would be made to borrowers with similar 
characteristics, using similar types of properties as 
collateral.  The fair value of cost method limited 
partnerships is determined using reported net asset 
values.  The fair value of bank loans, which are reported 
in other investments, is based on broker quotes from 

Financial liabilities

brokers familiar with the loans and current market 
conditions.  The fair value of agent loans, which are 
reported in other investments, is based on discounted 
cash flow calculations.  Risk adjusted discount rates are 
selected using current rates at which similar loans 
would be made to borrowers with similar 
characteristics.  The fair value measurements for 
mortgage loans, cost method limited partnerships, 
bank loans and agent loans are categorized as Level 3.

The fair value of contractholder funds on 

investment contracts is based on the terms of the 
underlying contracts incorporating current market-
based crediting rates for similar contracts that reflect 
the Company’s own credit risk.  Deferred annuities 
classified in contractholder funds are valued based on 
discounted cash flow models that incorporate current 
market-based margins and reflect the Company’s own 
credit risk.  Immediate annuities without life 
contingencies are valued based on discounted cash 
flow models that incorporate current market-based 
implied interest rates and reflect the Company’s own 
credit risk.  The fair value measurement for

contractholder funds on investment contracts is

The fair value of long-term debt is based on market 

observable data (such as the fair value of the debt 
when traded as an asset) or is determined using 
discounted cash flow calculations based on current 
interest rates for instruments with comparable terms 
and considers the Company’s own credit risk.  The 
liability for collateral is valued at carrying value due to 
its short-term nature.  The fair value measurements for 
long-term debt and liability for collateral are 
categorized as Level 2.

Note 7 Derivative Financial Instruments and Off-balance sheet Financial Instruments

The Company uses derivatives for risk reduction 
and to increase investment portfolio returns through 
asset replication.  Risk reduction activity is focused on 
managing the risks with certain assets and liabilities 
arising from the potential adverse impacts from 
changes in risk-free interest rates, changes in equity 
market valuations, increases in credit spreads and 
foreign currency fluctuations.  

Asset replication refers to the “synthetic” creation 
of assets through the use of derivatives.  The Company 
replicates fixed income securities using a combination 
of a credit default swap or a foreign currency forward 
contract and one or more highly rated fixed income 
securities, primarily investment grade host bonds, to 
synthetically replicate the economic characteristics of 
one or more cash market securities.  The Company 
replicates equity securities using futures and options 
to increase equity exposure.

Property-Liability may use interest rate swaps, 

swaptions, futures and options to manage the interest 
rate risks of existing investments.  These instruments 
are utilized to change the duration of the portfolio in 
order to offset the economic effect that interest rates 
would otherwise have on the fair value of its fixed 
income securities.  Credit default swaps are typically 
used to mitigate the credit risk within the Property-
Liability fixed income portfolio.  Equity index futures 
230  

  www.allstate.com

and options are used by Property-Liability to offset 
valuation losses in the equity portfolio during periods 
of declining equity market values.  In addition, equity 
futures are used to hedge the market risk related to 
deferred compensation liability contracts.  Forward 
contracts are primarily used by Property-Liability to 
hedge foreign currency risk associated with holding 
foreign currency denominated investments and foreign 
operations.

The Company utilizes several derivative strategies 
to manage risk in Allstate Life and Allstate Annuities.  
Asset-liability management is a risk management 
strategy that is principally employed by Allstate Life 
and Allstate Annuities to balance the respective 
interest-rate sensitivities of its assets and liabilities.  
Depending upon the attributes of the assets acquired 
and liabilities issued, derivative instruments such as 
interest rate swaps, caps, swaptions and futures are 
utilized to change the interest rate characteristics of 
existing assets and liabilities to ensure the relationship 
is maintained within specified ranges and to reduce 
exposure to rising or falling interest rates.  Credit 
default swaps are typically used to mitigate the credit 
risk within the Allstate Life and Allstate Annuities fixed 
income portfolios.  Futures and options are used for 
hedging the equity exposure contained in equity 
indexed life and annuity product contracts that offer 

equity returns to contractholders.  In addition, the 
Company uses equity index futures to offset valuation 
losses in the equity portfolio during periods of 
declining equity market values.  Foreign currency 
swaps and forwards are primarily used to reduce the 
foreign currency risk associated with holding foreign 
currency denominated investments. 

The Company also has derivatives embedded in 
non-derivative host contracts that are required to be 
separated from the host contracts and accounted for 
at fair value with changes in fair value of embedded 
derivatives reported in net income.  The Company’s 
primary embedded derivatives are equity options in life 
and annuity product contracts, which provide equity 
returns to contractholders.

When derivatives meet specific criteria, they may 
be designated as accounting hedges and accounted 
for as fair value, cash flow, foreign currency fair value or 
foreign currency cash flow hedges.  The Company 
designates certain investment risk transfer reinsurance 
agreements as fair value hedges when the hedging 
instrument is highly effective in offsetting the risk of 
changes in the fair value of the hedged item.  The 
Company designates certain of its foreign currency 
swap contracts as cash flow hedges when the hedging 
instrument is highly effective in offsetting the exposure 
of variations in cash flows for the hedged risk that 
could affect net income.  Amounts are reclassified to 
net investment income or realized capital gains and 
losses as the hedged item affects net income.

The notional amounts specified in the contracts 

are used to calculate the exchange of contractual 
payments under the agreements and are generally not 
representative of the potential for gain or loss on these 
agreements.  However, the notional amounts specified 
in credit default swaps where the Company has sold 
credit protection represent the maximum amount of 
potential loss, assuming no recoveries.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

Fair value, which is equal to the carrying value, is 

the estimated amount that the Company would receive 
or pay to terminate the derivative contracts at the 
reporting date.  The carrying value amounts for OTC 
derivatives are further adjusted for the effects, if any, 
of enforceable master netting agreements and are 
presented on a net basis, by counterparty agreement, 
in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.  
For certain exchange traded and cleared derivatives, 
margin deposits are required as well as daily cash 
settlements of margin accounts.  As of December 31, 
2017, the Company pledged $10 million in the form of 
margin deposits.

For those derivatives which qualify for fair value 

hedge accounting, net income includes the changes in 
the fair value of both the derivative instrument and the 
hedged risk, and therefore reflects any hedging 
ineffectiveness.  For cash flow hedges, gains and losses 
are amortized from AOCI and are reported in net 
income in the same period the forecasted transactions 
being hedged impact net income.

Non-hedge accounting is generally used for 

“portfolio” level hedging strategies where the terms of 
the individual hedged items do not meet the strict 
homogeneity requirements to permit the application of 
hedge accounting.  For non-hedge derivatives, net 
income includes changes in fair value and accrued 
periodic settlements, when applicable.  With the 
exception of non-hedge derivatives used for asset 
replication and non-hedge embedded derivatives, all of 
the Company’s derivatives are evaluated for their 
ongoing effectiveness as either accounting hedge or 
non-hedge derivative financial instruments on at least 
a quarterly basis.

In 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company had no 

derivatives used in fair value hedging relationships.

The Company manages its exposure to credit risk 

by utilizing highly rated counterparties, establishing 
risk control limits, executing legally enforceable master 
netting agreements (“MNAs”) and obtaining collateral 
where appropriate.  The Company uses MNAs for OTC 
derivative transactions that permit either party to net 
payments due for transactions and collateral is either 
pledged or obtained when certain predetermined 
exposure limits are exceeded.  As of December 31, 
2017, counterparties pledged $3 million in cash to the 
Company, and the Company pledged $14 million in 
cash and securities to counterparties which includes $6 
million of collateral posted under MNAs for contracts 
containing credit-risk contingent provisions that are in 
a liability position and $8 million of collateral posted 
under MNAs for contracts without credit-risk-

contingent features.  The Company has not incurred 
any losses on derivative financial instruments due to 
counterparty nonperformance.  Other derivatives, 
including futures and certain option contracts, are 
traded on organized exchanges which require margin 
deposits and guarantee the execution of trades, 
thereby mitigating any potential credit risk.

Counterparty credit exposure represents the 

Company’s potential loss if all of the counterparties 
concurrently fail to perform under the contractual 
terms of the contracts and all collateral, if any, 
becomes worthless.  This exposure is measured by the 
fair value of OTC derivative contracts with a positive 
fair value at the reporting date reduced by the effect, if 
any, of legally enforceable master netting agreements.

Market risk is the risk that the Company will incur 

losses due to adverse changes in market rates and 
prices.  Market risk exists for all of the derivative 
financial instruments the Company currently holds, as 
these instruments may become less valuable due to 
adverse changes in market conditions.  To limit this 
risk, the Company’s senior management has 
established risk control limits.  In addition, changes in 
fair value of the derivative financial instruments that 
the Company uses for risk management purposes are 
generally offset by the change in the fair value or cash 
flows of the hedged risk component of the related 
assets, liabilities or forecasted transactions.

Certain of the Company’s derivative instruments 

contain credit-risk-contingent termination events, 
cross-default provisions and credit support annex 
agreements.  Credit-risk-contingent termination events 
allow the counterparties to terminate the derivative 
agreement or a specific trade on certain dates if AIC’s, 
ALIC’s or Allstate Life Insurance Company of New 

York’s (“ALNY”) financial strength credit ratings by 
Moody’s or S&P fall below a certain level.  Credit-risk-
contingent cross-default provisions allow the 
counterparties to terminate the derivative agreement if 
the Company defaults by pre-determined threshold 
amounts on certain debt instruments.  Credit-risk-
contingent credit support annex agreements specify 
the amount of collateral the Company must post to 
counterparties based on AIC’s, ALIC’s or ALNY’s 
financial strength credit ratings by Moody’s or S&P, or 
in the event AIC, ALIC or ALNY are no longer rated by 
either Moody’s or S&P.  

The following summarizes the fair value of 

derivative instruments with termination, cross-default 
or collateral credit-risk-contingent features that are in 
a liability position as of December 31, as well as the fair 
value of assets and collateral that are netted against 
the liability in accordance with provisions within legally 
enforceable MNAs.

Credit derivatives – selling protection

A credit default swap (“CDS”) is a derivative 

instrument, representing an agreement between two 
parties to exchange the credit risk of a specified entity 
(or a group of entities), or an index based on the credit 
risk of a group of entities (all commonly referred to as 
the “reference entity” or a portfolio of “reference 
entities”), in return for a periodic premium.  In selling 

protection, CDS’s are used to replicate fixed income 
securities and to complement the cash market when 
credit exposure to certain issuers is not available or 
when the derivative alternative is less expensive than 
the cash market alternative.  CDS’s typically have a 
five-year term.

In selling protection with CDS, the Company sells 

credit protection on an identified single name, a basket 
of names in a first-to-default (“FTD”) structure or credit 
derivative index (“CDX”) that is generally investment 
grade, and in return receives periodic premiums 
through expiration or termination of the agreement.  
With single name CDS, this premium or credit spread 
generally corresponds to the difference between the 
yield on the reference entity’s public fixed maturity 
cash instruments and swap rates at the time the 
agreement is executed.  With a FTD basket, because of 
the additional credit risk inherent in a basket of named 
reference entities, the premium generally corresponds 
to a high proportion of the sum of the credit spreads of 
the names in the basket and the correlation between 
the names.  CDX is utilized to take a position on 
multiple (generally 125) reference entities.  Credit 
events are typically defined as bankruptcy, failure to 
pay, or restructuring, depending on the nature of the 
reference entities.  If a credit event occurs, the 
Company settles with the counterparty, either through 
physical settlement or cash settlement.  In a physical 

Off-balance sheet financial instruments

settlement, a reference asset is delivered by the buyer 
of protection to the Company, in exchange for cash 
payment at par, whereas in a cash settlement, the 
Company pays the difference between par and the 
prescribed value of the reference asset.  When a credit 
event occurs in a single name or FTD basket (for FTD, 
the first credit event occurring for any one name in the 
basket), the contract terminates at the time of 
settlement.  For CDX, the reference entity’s name 
incurring the credit event is removed from the index 
while the contract continues until expiration.  The 
maximum payout on a CDS is the contract notional 
amount.  A physical settlement may afford the 
Company with recovery rights as the new owner of the 
asset.

The Company monitors risk associated with credit 

derivatives through individual name credit limits at 
both a credit derivative and a combined cash 
instrument/credit derivative level.  The ratings of 
individual names for which protection has been sold 
are also monitored.

In the preceding table, the contractual amounts 

represent the amount at risk if the contract is fully 
drawn upon, the counterparty defaults and the value of 
any underlying security becomes worthless.  Unless 
noted otherwise, the Company does not require 
collateral or other security to support off-balance sheet 
financial instruments with credit risk.

Commitments to invest in limited partnership 
interests represent agreements to acquire new or 
additional participation in certain limited partnership 
investments.  The Company enters into these 
agreements in the normal course of business.  Because 
the investments in limited partnerships are not actively 
traded, it is not practical to estimate the fair value of 
these commitments.

Private placement commitments represent 

commitments to purchase private placement debt and 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

private equity securities at a future date.  The 
Company enters into these agreements in the normal 
course of business.  The fair value of the debt 
commitments generally cannot be estimated on the 
date the commitment is made as the terms and 
conditions of the underlying private placement 
securities are not yet final.  Because the private equity 
securities are not actively traded, it is not practical to 
estimate fair value of the commitments.

Other loan commitments are agreements to lend 

to a borrower provided there is no violation of any 
condition established in the contract.  The Company 
enters into these agreements to commit to future loan 
fundings at predetermined interest rates.  
Commitments have either fixed or varying expiration 
dates or other termination clauses.  The fair value of 
these commitments is insignificant.

Note 8 Reserve for Property and Casualty Insurance Claims and Claims Expense

The Company establishes reserves for claims and 
claims expense on reported and unreported claims of 
insured losses.  The Company’s reserving process 
takes into account known facts and interpretations of 
circumstances and factors including the Company’s 
experience with similar cases, actual claims paid, 
historical trends involving claim payment patterns and 
pending levels of unpaid claims, loss management 
programs, product mix and contractual terms, changes 
in law and regulation, judicial decisions, and economic 
conditions.  In the normal course of business, the 
Company may also supplement its claims processes by 
utilizing third party adjusters, appraisers, engineers, 
inspectors, and other professionals and information 
sources to assess and settle catastrophe and non-
catastrophe related claims.  The effects of inflation are 
implicitly considered in the reserving process.

Because reserves are estimates of unpaid portions 
of losses that have occurred, including incurred but not 

reported (“IBNR”) losses, the establishment of 
appropriate reserves, including reserves for 
catastrophes and reserves and reinsurance 
recoverables for Discontinued Lines and Coverages, is 
an inherently uncertain and complex process.  The 
ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from 
recorded amounts, which are based on management’s 
best estimates.  The highest degree of uncertainty is 
associated with reserves for losses incurred in the 
current reporting period as it contains the greatest 
proportion of losses that have not been reported or 
settled.  The Company regularly updates its reserve 
estimates as new information becomes available and 
as events unfold that may affect the resolution of 
unsettled claims.  Changes in prior year reserve 
estimates, which may be material, are reported in 
property and casualty insurance claims and claims 
expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations 
in the period such changes are determined.

Incurred claims and claims expense represents the 
sum of paid losses and reserve changes in the calendar 
year.  This expense includes losses from catastrophes 
of $3.23 billion, $2.57 billion and $1.72 billion in 2017, 

2016 and 2015, respectively, net of reinsurance and 
other recoveries (see Note 10).  Catastrophes are an 
inherent risk of the property and casualty insurance 
business that have contributed to, and will continue to 
2017 Annual Report  237
2017 Annual Report  237

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

contribute to, material year-to-year fluctuations in the 
Company’s results of operations and financial position.

The Company calculates and records a single best 

reserve estimate for losses from catastrophes, in 
conformance with generally accepted actuarial 
standards.  As a result, management believes that no 
other estimate is better than the recorded amount.  
Due to the uncertainties involved, including the factors 
described above, the ultimate cost of losses may vary 
materially from recorded amounts, which are based on 
management’s best estimates.  Accordingly, 
management believes that it is not practical to develop 
a meaningful range for any such changes in losses 
incurred.

During 2017, incurred claims and claims expense 
related to prior years was primarily comprised of net 
decreases in auto and homeowners reserves of $490 
million and $131 million, respectively, primarily related 
to a reduction in claim severity estimates for liability 
coverages, net increases in Discontinued Lines and 
Coverages of $96 million and net increases in other 
reserves of $22 million.  Incurred claims and claims 
expense includes favorable catastrophe loss 
reestimates of $18 million, net of reinsurance and other 
recoveries.

During 2016, incurred claims and claims expense 
related to prior years was primarily composed of net 
decreases in auto reserves of $155 million primarily due 
to claim severity development for bodily injury 
coverage that was better than expected, net 
decreases in homeowners reserves of $24 million due 
to favorable non-catastrophe reserve reestimates, net 
increases in other reserves of $57 million primarily due 
to unfavorable commercial business non-catastrophe 
losses, and net increases in Discontinued Lines and 
Coverages reserves of $105 million.  Incurred claims 
and claims expense includes unfavorable catastrophe 
loss reestimates of $6 million, net of reinsurance and 
other recoveries.

During 2015, incurred claims and claims expense 
related to prior years was primarily composed of net 
increases in auto reserves of $30 million primarily due 
to claim severity development for bodily injury 
coverage that was more than expected and litigation 
settlements, net decreases in homeowners reserves of 
$24 million due to favorable non-catastrophe reserve 
reestimates, net increases in other reserves of $22 
million, and net increases in Discontinued Lines and 
Coverages reserves of $53 million.  Incurred claims and 
claims expense includes favorable catastrophe loss 
reestimates of $15 million, net of reinsurance and other 
recoveries.

years ago.  IBNR reserves represent $733 million of the total reserves as of December 31, 2017.

Management believes that the reserve for property 
and casualty insurance claims and claims expense, net 
of reinsurance recoverables, is appropriately 
established in the aggregate and adequate to cover 
the ultimate net cost of reported and unreported 
claims arising from losses which had occurred by the 
date of the Consolidated Statements of Financial 
Position based on available facts, technology, laws and 
regulations.

Allstate’s reserves for asbestos claims were $884 

million and $912 million, net of reinsurance 
recoverables of $412 million and $444 million, as of 
December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  Reserves for 
environmental claims were $166 million and $179 
million, net of reinsurance recoverables of $33 million 
and $40 million, as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, 
respectively.  For further discussion of asbestos and

(1)  In 2006, the Company disposed of substantially all of its variable annuity business through reinsurance agreements with The 

Prudential Insurance Company of America, a subsidiary of Prudential Financial, Inc. (collectively “Prudential”).

The Company records an adjustment to the 
reserve for life-contingent contract benefits that 
represents the amount by which the reserve 
balance would increase if the net unrealized gains 
in the applicable product investment portfolios 
were realized and reinvested at current lower 
interest rates, resulting in a premium deficiency. 
The offset to this liability is recorded as a reduction 
of the unrealized net capital gains included in 
AOCI.

In conjunction with the segment changes in 

2017, the Company evaluated the need for a 
reserve adjustment separately for traditional life 
insurance and immediate annuities with life 
contingencies.  As of December 31, 2017, the 
Company recorded a $315 million increase to the 
reserve for life-contingent contract benefits and a 
$249 million decrease to unrealized net capital 
gains, after-tax, included in shareholders’ equity.  
This liability was zero as of December 31, 2016.

The Company offered various guarantees to 

variable annuity contractholders.  In 2006, the 
Company disposed of substantially all of its variable 
annuity business through reinsurance agreements with 
Prudential.  Liabilities for variable contract guarantees 
related to death benefits are included in the reserve for 
life-contingent contract benefits and the liabilities 
related to the income, withdrawal and accumulation 
benefits are included in contractholder funds.  All 
liabilities for variable contract guarantees are reported 
on a gross basis on the balance sheet with a 
corresponding reinsurance recoverable asset for those 
contracts subject to reinsurance.

Absent any contract provision wherein the 

Company guarantees either a minimum return or 
account value upon death, a specified contract 
anniversary date, partial withdrawal or annuitization, 
variable annuity and variable life insurance 
contractholders bear the investment risk that the 
separate accounts’ funds may not meet their stated 
investment objectives.  The account balances of 
variable annuities contracts’ separate accounts with 
guarantees included $3.02 billion and $2.93 billion of 
equity, fixed income and balanced mutual funds and 
$322 million and $364 million of money market mutual 
funds as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

The table below presents information regarding the Company’s variable annuity contracts with guarantees.  The 
Company’s variable annuity contracts may offer more than one type of guarantee in each contract; therefore, the sum 
of amounts listed exceeds the total account balances of variable annuity contracts’ separate accounts with

(1)  Defined as the estimated current guaranteed minimum death benefit in excess of the current account balance as of the 

balance sheet date.

(2)  Defined as the estimated present value of the guaranteed minimum annuity payments in excess of the current account 

balance.

(3)  Defined as the estimated current guaranteed minimum withdrawal balance (initial deposit) in excess of the current account 

balance as of the balance sheet date.

(4)  Defined as the estimated present value of the guaranteed minimum accumulation balance in excess of the current account 

balance.

The liability for death and income benefit 

guarantees is equal to a benefit ratio multiplied by the 
cumulative contract charges earned, plus accrued 
interest less contract excess guarantee benefit 
payments.  The benefit ratio is calculated as the 
estimated present value of all expected contract 
excess guarantee benefits divided by the present value 
of all expected contract charges.  The establishment of 
reserves for these guarantees requires the projection 
of future fund values, mortality, persistency and 
customer benefit utilization rates.  These assumptions 
are periodically reviewed and updated.  For guarantees 
related to death benefits, benefits represent the 
projected excess guaranteed minimum death benefit 
payments.  For guarantees related to income benefits, 
benefits represent the present value of the minimum 
guaranteed annuitization benefits in excess of the 
projected account balance at the time of annuitization.

Projected benefits and contract charges used in 

determining the liability for certain guarantees are 
developed using models and stochastic scenarios that 
are also used in the development of estimated 
expected gross profits.  Underlying assumptions for 
the liability related to income benefits include assumed 
future annuitization elections based on factors such as 
the extent of benefit to the potential annuitant, 
eligibility conditions and the annuitant’s attained age.  
The liability for guarantees is re-evaluated periodically, 
and adjustments are made to the liability balance 
through a charge or credit to life and annuity contract 
benefits.

Guarantees related to the majority of withdrawal 

and accumulation benefits are considered to be 
derivative financial instruments; therefore, the liability 
for these benefits is established based on its fair value.

Property and casualty

Property and casualty reinsurance is in place for 

the Allstate Protection, Discontinued Lines and 
Coverages and Service Businesses segments.  The 
Company purchases reinsurance after evaluating the 
financial condition of the reinsurer, as well as the terms 
and price of coverage.  Developments in the insurance 
and reinsurance industries have fostered a movement 
to segregate asbestos, environmental and other 
discontinued lines exposures into separate legal 
entities with dedicated capital.  Regulatory bodies in 
certain cases have supported these actions.  The 
Company is unable to determine the impact, if any, 
that these developments will have on the collectability 
of reinsurance recoverables in the future.

Property and casualty reinsurance recoverable

Total amounts recoverable from reinsurers as of 

December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $6.57 billion and 
$6.28 billion, respectively, including $96 million and $93 
million, respectively, related to property and casualty 
losses paid by the Company and billed to reinsurers, 
and $6.47 billion and $6.18 billion, respectively, 
estimated by the Company with respect to ceded 
unpaid losses (including IBNR), which are not billable 
until the losses are paid.

With the exception of the recoverable balances 
from the Michigan Catastrophic Claims Association 
(“MCCA”), Lloyd’s of London, New Jersey Property-
Liability Insurance Guaranty Association (“PLIGA”) and 
other industry pools and facilities, the largest 
reinsurance recoverable balance the Company had 
outstanding was $61 million from Westport Insurance 
Corporation as of both December 31, 2017 and 2016.  
No other amount due or estimated to be due from any 
single reinsurer was in excess of $31 million and $35 
million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

The allowance for uncollectible reinsurance was 
$70 million and $84 million as of December 31, 2017 
and 2016, respectively, and is primarily related to the 
Company’s Discontinued Lines and Coverages 
segment.

Industry pools and facilities

Reinsurance recoverable on paid and unpaid 

claims including IBNR as of December 31, 2017 and 
2016 includes $5.26 billion and $4.95 billion, 
respectively, from the MCCA.  The MCCA is a state-
mandated indemnification mechanism for personal 
injury protection losses that exceed a retention level 
which is adjusted upward every other MCCA fiscal year 
by the lesser of 6% or the increase in the Consumer 
Price Index.  The retention level is currently $555 
thousand per claim for the fiscal two-years ending 
June 30, 2019 compared to $545 thousand per claim 
for the fiscal two-years ending June 30, 2017.  The 
MCCA is obligated to fund the ultimate liability for 
member companies (companies actively writing motor 
vehicle coverage in Michigan and those with runoff 
policies) qualifying claims and claims expenses.  The 
MCCA operates similar to a reinsurance program and is 
annually funded by participating member companies 
(companies actively writing motor vehicle coverage in 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

Michigan) through a per vehicle annual assessment 
that is currently $170 per coverage.  The assessment is 
incurred by the Company as polices are written and 
recovered as a component of premiums from our 
customers.  

The MCCA has been legally authorized to annually 

assess participating member companies pursuant to 
enabling legislation that describes both the annual 
determination and assessment.  This assessment is 
recorded as a component of the premiums charged to 
the Company’s customers.  These assessments paid to 
the MCCA provide funds for the indemnification for 
losses described above.  The MCCA is required to 
assess an amount each year sufficient to cover 
members’ actuarially determined present value of 
expected payments on lifetime claims of all persons 
expected to be catastrophically injured in that year, its 
operating expenses, and adjustments for the amount 
of excesses or deficiencies in prior assessments.  
The MCCA prepares statutory-basis financial 

statements in conformity with accounting practices 
prescribed or permitted by the State of Michigan 
Department of Insurance and Financial Services (“MI 
DOI”).  The MI DOI has granted the MCCA a statutory 
permitted practice that expires in 2019 to discount its 
liabilities for loss and loss adjustment expense.  As of 
June 30, 2017, the date of its most recent annual 
financial report, the MCCA had cash and invested 
assets of $19.60 billion and an accumulated deficit of 
$2.63 billion.  The permitted practice reduced the 
accumulated deficit by $46.08 billion.

Allstate sells and administers policies as a 

participant in the National Flood Insurance Program 
(“NFIP”).  The amounts recoverable as of December 31, 
2017 and 2016 were $88 million and $77 million, 
respectively.  Ceded premiums earned include $263 
million, $274 million and $293 million in 2017, 2016 and 
2015, respectively.  Ceded losses incurred include $1.12 
billion, $537 million and $120 million in 2017, 2016 and 
2015, respectively.  Under the arrangement, the 
Federal Government pays all covered claims and 
certain qualifying claim expenses.

The PLIGA, as the statutory administrator of the 

New Jersey Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund 
(“UCJF”), provides compensation to qualified claimants 
for personal injury protection, bodily injury, or death 
caused by private passenger automobiles operated by 
uninsured or “hit and run” drivers.  The UCJF also 
provides private passenger stranger pedestrian 
personal injury protection benefits when no other 
coverage is available.  The fund provides 
reimbursement to insurers for the medical benefits 
portion of personal injury protection coverage paid in 
excess of $75,000 with no limits for policies issued or 
renewed prior to January 1, 1991 and paid in excess of 
$75,000 and capped at $250,000 for policies issued or 
renewed from January 1, 1991 to December 31, 2003.  
PLIGA annually assesses all admitted property and 
casualty insurers writing motor vehicle liability 
insurance in New Jersey for PLIGA expenses.  A 
significant portion of the incurred claim reserves and 
the recoverable can be attributed to a small number of 
catastrophic claims.  Assessments paid to PLIGA for

the UCJF program totaled $8.9 million in 2017.  The 
amounts of paid and unpaid recoverable as of 
December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $493 million and 
$506 million, respectively.

Ceded premiums earned under the Florida 

Hurricane Catastrophe Fund (“FHCF”) agreement were 
$11 million, $12 million and $13 million in 2017, 2016 and 
2015, respectively.  Ceded losses in 2017 were $19 
million.  There were no ceded losses incurred in 2016 or 
2015.  The Company has access to reimbursement 
provided by the FHCF for 90% of qualifying personal 
property losses that exceed its current retention of $56 
million for the 2 largest hurricanes and $19 million for 
other hurricanes, up to a maximum total of $187 million 
effective from June 1, 2017 to May 31, 2018.  As of 
December 31, 2017 recoverable from the FHCF totaled 
$19 million.  There were no amounts recoverable from 
the FHCF as of December 31, 2016.

Catastrophe reinsurance

The Company’s reinsurance program is designed 

to provide reinsurance protection for catastrophes 
resulting from multiple perils including hurricanes, 
windstorms, hail, tornadoes, fires following 
earthquakes, earthquakes and wildfires.
•  The majority of our program comprises multi-year 

contracts, primarily placed in the traditional 
reinsurance market, such that one third of the 
program is renewed every year. 

•  Coverage is generally purchased on a broad 

geographic, product line and multiple peril loss 
basis.

•  The Company purchases reinsurance from 

traditional reinsurance companies as well as the 
insurance linked securities market (e.g. “PCS 
Agreements”).

•  Florida property and New Jersey property and auto 

are each covered by separate agreements, as the 
risk of loss is different and our subsidiaries 
operating in these states are separately 
capitalized. 
The Company has the following catastrophe 

reinsurance agreements in effect as of December 31, 
2017:

The Nationwide Per Occurrence Excess 

Catastrophe Reinsurance Program (the “Nationwide 
Program”) provides $4.42 billion of reinsurance 
coverage subject to a $500 million retention and is 
subject to the amount of reinsurance placed in each of 
its nine layers. The Nationwide Program comprises 
three agreements: The Per Occurrence Excess 
Agreement, the 2014-1 Property Claim Services (“PCS”) 
Agreement, and the 2017-1 Excess Catastrophe 
Reinsurance Contract.

Per Occurrence Excess Agreement, which is placed 

in the traditional reinsurance market, reinsures 
personal lines property and automobile excess 
catastrophe losses caused by multiple perils in every 
state except New Jersey and only includes personal 
lines automobile excess catastrophe losses in Florida.  
The agreement comprises layers one through six and 
248  

  www.allstate.com

portions of layers eight and nine.  Coverage for each of 
the first through fifth layers comprises three contracts, 
with each contract providing one-third of 95% of the 
total layer limit and expiring May 31, 2018, May 31, 2019 
and May 31, 2020.  The contracts expiring May 31, 2019 
and May 31, 2020, include coverage for automobile 
losses in Florida, while the contract expiring May 31, 
2018 does not include such provision.  The sixth layer 
and eighth layer contracts placed in the traditional 
reinsurance market contain comparable contract terms 
and conditions as layers one through five.

The sixth layer is 95% placed and comprises one 

contract expiring May 31, 2022.  The contracts for 
layers one through six provide $3.07 billion in per 
occurrence reinsurance limits subject to a $500 million 
retention.  Coverage for a portion of the eighth layer is 
provided by one contract expiring May 31, 2022.  The 
contract provides a $446 million limit and is 29.37% 
placed.  Unlike layer one through five contracts, the 
sixth and eighth layer contracts each contain an annual 
variable reset option which allows for the adjustment 
of each contract’s attachment and exhaustion levels 
within specified limits.  The variable reset option 
requires a premium adjustment.  The contracts for 
each of the first through fifth layers include one 
reinstatement of limits per year, with premium 
required.  The sixth and eighth layer contracts each 
contain one reinstatement of limits over their seven 
year term with premium required.  Reinsurance 
premiums for all contracts are subject to 
redetermination for exposure changes on an annual 
basis. 

Another contract forming a portion of layers eight 

and nine provides a $25 million limit in excess of a 
$2.75 billion retention, is 100% placed and expires May 
31, 2018.  Reinsurance limits of 5% of $1.67 billion in 
excess of $2.75 billion are deemed in place.  In addition, 
recoveries from contracts in layers six through and 
including layer nine inure to the benefit of this contract.

2014-1 PCS Excess Agreement reinsures personal 

lines property and automobile excess catastrophe 
losses caused by hurricanes in 29 states and the 
District of Columbia, and earthquakes, including fires 
following earthquakes, in California, New York and 
Washington.  The agreement comprises three 
contracts with each contract’s risk period beginning on 
May 22, 2014.  Two of the three contracts’ risk periods 
expire on May 21, 2018 and one contract’s risk period 
expires on May 21, 2019.  The placement of these three 
contracts achieves, for the perils of hurricanes, 
earthquakes and fires following earthquakes, $305 
million limit (or 95% of $321 million) between $3.07 
billion to $3.40 billion seventh layer; $115 million limit 
(or 26% of $446 million) between $3.40 billion to $3.84 
billion eighth layer; and $330 million limit (or 57% of 
$578 million) between $3.84 billion to $4.42 billion ninth 
layer.  The contracts comprising the agreement contain 
a variable reset option which the ceding entities may 
invoke for risk periods subsequent to the first risk 
period and which allows for the annual adjustment of 
each contract’s attachment and exhaustion levels 
within specified limits.  The variable reset option 

requires a premium adjustment.  The contracts do not 
include a reinstatement of limits.

2017-1 Excess Catastrophe Reinsurance Contract 

reinsures personal lines property and automobile 
excess losses in 48 states and the District of Columbia, 
excluding Florida and New Jersey, caused by 
hurricanes, severe thunderstorms, earthquakes 
including fire following winter storms, volcanic 
eruptions, and meteorite impacts.  The contract 
reinsures actual losses to personal lines property 
business located in the covered territory and arising 
out of a covered event.  Amounts payable for 
automobile losses are based on insured industry losses 
as reported by PCS and further indexed by annual 
payout factors specific to automobile exposures in the 
contract’s covered areas.  Reinsurance recoveries 
under the contract are limited to our ultimate net loss 
from a covered event subject to the contract’s limit.  
The contract’s risk period began March 31, 2017 and 
terminates on November 30, 2021.  The contract 
provides a $375 million limit (or 37% of $1.02 billion) 
between a $3.40 billion to $4.42 billion layer.  The 
contract contains a variable reset option, which the 
ceding entities may invoke for risk periods subsequent 
to the first risk period and which allows for the annual 
adjustment of the contract’s attachment and 
exhaustion levels within specified limits.  The variable 
reset option requires a premium.  The contract does 
not include a restatement of limits. 

The following programs are designed apart from 

the Nationwide Program to address distinct exposures 
in certain states and markets.  These programs are 
described below and are disregarded when 
determining coverage under the contracts included in 
the Nationwide Program.

The Company has a separate reinsurance program 

in Florida designed to cover personal lines property 
policies in Florida written through its separately 
capitalized wholly-owned subsidiaries Castle Key 
Insurance Company (“CKIC”) and Castle Key Indemnity 
Company (“CKI”, and together with CKIC, “Castle Key”).

Florida Excess Catastrophe Reinsurance 

Agreement comprises five contracts, as described 
below, which reinsure Castle Key for personal lines 
property excess catastrophe losses in Florida.  The 
agreement includes two contracts placed in the 
traditional market, CKIC’s and CKI’s reimbursement 
contracts with the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund 
(“Mandatory FHCF contracts”), and the Sanders Re 
2017-2 Contract (“Sanders Re 2017-2 contract”) placed 
in the ILS markets. 

Below FHCF Contract reinsures personal lines 

property excess catastrophe losses caused by multiple 
perils in Florida.  The contract is 100% placed and 
provides three separate limits of $38 million in excess 
of a $20 million retention for each occurrence, of which 
two limits remain outstanding.  One limit of $38 million 
was exhausted from the impact of Hurricane Irma.  The 
first reinstatement of limits is prepaid and the second 
or final reinstatement requires additional premium.  
Reinsurance premium is subject to redetermination for 
exposure changes.  

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

Mandatory FHCF Contracts reinsures qualifying 
personal lines property losses caused by storms the 
National Hurricane Center declares to be hurricanes.  
The contracts provide 90% of $187 million of limits in 
excess of retention with no reinstatement of limits.  
The limits and retentions of the mandatory FHCF 
contracts are calculated independently for CKIC and 
CKI and are subject to re-measurement based on June 
30, 2017 exposure data.  For each of the two largest 
hurricanes, the retention is $56 million and retention 
equal to one third of that amount, or approximately $19 
million, is applicable to all other hurricanes for the 
season beginning June 1, 2017.  In addition, the FHCF’s 
retention is subject to adjustment upward or 
downward to an actual retention based on submitted 
exposures to the FHCF by all participants. $19 million of 
limit was exhausted from the impact of Hurricane Irma 
and $168 million of the limit remains outstanding.

Excess contract reinsures personal lines property 
excess catastrophe losses caused by multiple perils in 
Florida.  The contract provides one limit of $231 million 
in excess of a $20 million retention and is 100% placed.  
Recoveries from the Below FHCF contract and 
Mandatory FHCF contracts inure to the benefit of this 
contract, resulting in the Excess contract providing 
reinsurance for loss occurrences not subject to 
reimbursement under the FHCF contracts but 
reinsured under the multiple peril Excess contract.  The 
contract does not include a reinstatement of limits.  
$27 million of limit was exhausted for Hurricane Irma.  
Reinsurance premium is subject to redetermination for 
exposure. 

Sanders Re 2017-2 is a three-year term contract 

with a risk period effective June 1, 2017 through May 31, 
2020.  It reinsures qualifying personal lines property 
losses caused by a named storm event, a severe 
thunderstorm event, an earthquake event, a wildfire 
event, a volcanic eruption event, or a meteorite impact 
event in Florida as events declared by various 
reporting agencies, including PCS and as defined in the 
contract.  The contract provides limits of $200 million 
in excess of a $20 million retention and in excess of 
“stated reinsurance.”  For the June 1, 2017 to May 31, 
2018 risk period, stated reinsurance is defined to 
include the Below FHCF contract, the Mandatory FHCF 
contracts, which are deemed to exhaust due to loss 
occurrences subject to the non-FHCF contracts, and 
the Excess contract.  Stated reinsurance is deemed to 
be provided on a multiple peril basis under the terms 
of the non-FHCF contracts and includes an erosion 
feature, which provides that upon the exhaustion of a 
portion of the stated reinsurance, coverage under the 
Sanders Re contract shall be concurrently placed 
above and contiguous to the unexhausted portion of 
the stated reinsurance, if any.  The Sanders Re 2017-2 
contract contains a variable reset option, which Castle 
Key may invoke for risk periods subsequent to the first 
risk period and which allows for the annual adjustment 
of the contract’s attachment and exhaustion levels.  
The variable reset option requires a premium.  The 
contract does not contain a restatement of limits.

California E&S Earthquake Contract comprises one 

contract which reinsures personal lines property 
catastrophe losses in California caused by the peril of 
earthquake and insured by our excess and surplus lines 
insurer.  The contract expires June 30, 2018.  Unlike the 
contracts comprising the Nationwide Program, the E&S 
Earthquake agreement provides reinsurance on a 100% 
quota share basis with no retention.  The agreement 
reinsures only shake damage resulting from the 
earthquake peril. 

The Company ceded premiums earned of $344 

million, $381 million and $414 million under catastrophe 
reinsurance agreements in 2017, 2016 and 2015, 
respectively.

Asbestos, environmental and other

Reinsurance recoverables include $167 million and 
$174 million from Lloyd’s of London as of December 31, 
2017 and 2016, respectively.  Lloyd’s of London, 
through the creation of Equitas Limited, implemented 
a restructuring to solidify its capital base and to 
segregate claims for years prior to 1993.  In 2007, 
Berkshire Hathaway’s subsidiary, National Indemnity 
Company, assumed responsibility for the Equitas claim 
liabilities through a loss portfolio transfer reinsurance 
agreement and continues to runoff the Equitas claims.

Life and annuity products

The Company reinsures certain life insurance and 

annuity risks to other insurers primarily under yearly 
renewable term, coinsurance, modified coinsurance 
and coinsurance with funds withheld agreements.  
These agreements result in a passing of the agreed-
upon percentage of risk to the reinsurer in exchange 
for negotiated reinsurance premium payments.  
Modified coinsurance and coinsurance with funds 
withheld are similar to coinsurance, except that the 
cash and investments that support the liability for 
contract benefits are not transferred to the assuming 
company and settlements are made on a net basis 
between the companies.

For certain term life insurance policies issued prior 
to October 2009, the Company ceded up to 90% of the 
mortality risk depending on the year of policy issuance 
under coinsurance agreements to a pool of fourteen 
unaffiliated reinsurers.  Effective October 2009, 
mortality risk on term business is ceded under yearly 
renewable term agreements under which the Company 
cedes mortality in excess of its retention, which is 
consistent with how the Company generally reinsures 
its permanent life insurance business. 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

The Company’s New Jersey, Pennsylvania, 

Kentucky, Florida and Southeast States and California 
reinsurance agreements are described below.

New Jersey Excess Catastrophe Reinsurance 

Agreement comprises three contracts that reinsure 
personal lines property and automobile excess 
catastrophe losses in New Jersey caused by multiple 
perils.  The contracts expire May 31, 2018 May 31, 2019

31.66%, respectively, of $400 million of limits excess of 
a provisional $150 million retention, a $144 million 
retention, and a $165 million retention, respectively.  
Each contract includes one reinstatement of limits per 
contract year with premium due.  The reinsurance 
premium and retention are subject to redetermination 
for exposure changes on an annual basis.

Pennsylvania Excess Catastrophe Reinsurance 
Contract comprises a three-year term contract that 
reinsures personal lines property excess catastrophe 
losses in Pennsylvania caused by multi-perils.  The 
contract expires May 31, 2018 and provides three limits 
of $100 million excess of a $100 million retention 
subject to two limits being available in any one 
contract year and is 95% placed.  The reinsurance 
premium and retention are not subject to 
redetermination for exposure changes.

Kentucky Earthquake Excess Catastrophe 

Reinsurance Contract is a three-year contract that 
reinsures personal lines property excess catastrophe 
losses in Kentucky caused by earthquakes and fires 
following earthquakes.  The contract expires May 31, 
2020 and provides three limits of $28 million in excess 
of a $2 million retention with two limits being available 
in any one contract year and is 95% placed.  The 
reinsurance premium and retention are not subject to 
redetermination for exposure changes.

Aggregate Excess Catastrophe Florida and 

Southeast States Reinsurance Contract provides $200 
million of reinsurance limits for losses to personal lines 
automobile business (physical damage only) arising out 
of multiple perils and provided such losses arise out of 
a company declared catastrophe and result in 
qualifying losses in the State of Florida.  Once 
qualifying losses are incurred in the State of Florida, 
coverage also is provided for losses to personal lines 
automobile business (physical damage only) arising 
from the same catastrophe and occurring in Alabama, 
Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina and 
South Carolina. The $200 million of reinsurance limits is 
subject to a $300 million aggregate retention for losses 
arising out of one or all qualifying catastrophes 
commencing during the contract’s one-year term.  The 
contract does not include a restatement of limits.

In addition, the Company has used reinsurance to 

effect the disposition of certain blocks of business.  
The Company had reinsurance recoverables of $1.35 
billion and $1.41 billion as of December 31, 2017 and 
2016, respectively, due from Prudential related to the 
disposal of substantially all of its variable annuity

credited to contractholder funds of $20 million, and 
operating costs and expenses of $15 million were 
ceded to Prudential.  In 2016, premiums and contract 
charges of $78 million, contract benefits of $21 million, 
interest credited to contractholder funds of $20 million, 
and operating costs and expenses of $15 million were 
ceded to Prudential.  In 2015, premiums and contract 
charges of $94 million, contract benefits of $40 million, 
interest credited to contractholder funds of $21 million,

Scottish Re (U.S.) Inc. in connection with the disposition 
of substantially all of the direct response distribution 
business in 2003.

The Company is the assuming reinsurer for Lincoln 
Benefit Life Company’s (“LBL’s”) life insurance business 
sold through the Allstate agency channel and LBL’s 
payout annuity business in force prior to the sale of 
LBL on April 1, 2014.  Under the terms of the 
reinsurance agreement, the Company is required to 
have a trust with assets greater than or equal to the 
statutory reserves ceded by LBL to the Company, 
measured on a monthly basis.  As of December 31, 
2017, the trust held $5.89 billion of investments, which 
are reported in the Consolidated Statement of 
Financial Position.

As of December 31, 2017, the gross life insurance in 

force was $447.86 billion of which $86.64 billion was

On December 8, 2016, the Company issued $550 

million of 3.28% Senior Notes due 2026 and $700 
million of 4.20% Senior Notes due 2046.  The proceeds 
of this issuance were used for general corporate 
purposes, including in part to fund the purchase price 
for the acquisition of SquareTrade.

During 2016 and 2015, the Company repurchased 
principal debt amounts of $17 million and $11 million, 
respectively.

The Subordinated Debentures may be redeemed 
(i) in whole at any time or in part from time to time on 
or after January 15, 2023 for the 5.10% Subordinated 

Debentures and August 15, 2023 for the 5.75% 
Subordinated Debentures at their principal amount 
plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the 
date of redemption; provided that if the Subordinated 
Debentures are not redeemed in whole, at least $25 
million aggregate principal amount must remain 
outstanding, or (ii) in whole, but not in part, prior to 
January 15, 2023 for the 5.10% Subordinated 
Debentures and August 15, 2023 for the 5.75% 
Subordinated Debentures, within 90 days after the 
occurrence of certain tax and rating agency events, at 
their principal amount or, if greater, a make-whole 
redemption price, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, 
but excluding, the date of redemption.  The 5.75% 
Subordinated Debentures have this make-whole 
redemption price provision only when a reduction of 
equity credit assigned by a rating agency has occurred.

Interest on the 5.10% Subordinated Debentures is 

payable quarterly at the stated fixed annual rate to 
January 14, 2023, or any earlier redemption date, and 
then at an annual rate equal to the three-month LIBOR 
plus 3.165%.  Interest on the 5.75% Subordinated 
Debentures is payable semi-annually at the stated 
fixed annual rate to August 14, 2023, or any earlier 
redemption date, and then quarterly at an annual rate 
equal to the three-month LIBOR plus 2.938%.  The 
Company may elect to defer payment of interest on 
the Subordinated Debentures for one or more 
consecutive interest periods that do not exceed five 
years.  During a deferral period, interest will continue to 
accrue on the Subordinated Debentures at the then-
applicable rate and deferred interest will compound on 
each interest payment date.  If all deferred interest on 
the Subordinated Debentures is paid, the Company 
can again defer interest payments.

The Company has outstanding $500 million of 
Series A 6.50% and $224 million of Series B 6.125% 
Fixed-to-Floating Rate Junior Subordinated 
Debentures (together the “Debentures”).  The 
scheduled maturity dates for the Debentures are 
May 15, 2057 and May 15, 2037 for Series A and 
Series B, respectively, with a final maturity date of 
May 15, 2067.  The Debentures may be redeemed (i) in 
whole or in part, at any time on or after May 15, 2037 or 
May 15, 2017 for Series A and Series B, respectively, at 
the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest 
to the date of redemption, or (ii) in certain 
circumstances, in whole or in part, prior to May 15, 2037 
for Series A at the principal amount plus accrued and 
unpaid interest to the date of redemption or, if greater, 
a make-whole price.

Interest on the Debentures is payable semi-

annually at the stated fixed annual rate to May 15, 2037 
and May 15, 2017 for Series A and Series B, respectively, 
and then payable quarterly at an annual rate equal to 
the three-month LIBOR plus 2.12% and 1.935% for 
Series A and Series B, respectively.  The Company may 
elect at one or more times to defer payment of interest 
on the Debentures for one or more consecutive 
interest periods that do not exceed 10 years.  Interest 
compounds during such deferral periods at the rate in 
effect for each period.  The interest deferral feature 
obligates the Company in certain circumstances to 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

issue common stock or certain other types of securities 
if it cannot otherwise raise sufficient funds to make the 
required interest payments.  The Company has 
reserved 75 million shares of its authorized and 
unissued common stock to satisfy this obligation.

The terms of the Company’s outstanding 

subordinated debentures prohibit the Company from 
declaring or paying any dividends or distributions on 
common or preferred stock or redeeming, purchasing, 
acquiring, or making liquidation payments on common 
stock or preferred stock if the Company has elected to 
defer interest payments on the subordinated 
debentures, subject to certain limited exceptions.

In connection with the issuance of the Debentures, 

the Company entered into replacement capital 
covenants (“RCCs”).  These covenants were not 
intended for the benefit of the holders of the 
Debentures and could not be enforced by them.  
Rather, they were for the benefit of holders of one or 
more other designated series of the Company’s 
indebtedness (“covered debt”), currently the 5.75% 
Subordinated Debentures due 2053.  Pursuant to the 
Series A RCCs, the Company has agreed that it will not 
repay, redeem, or purchase the Series A Debentures on 
or before May 15, 2067 (or such earlier date on which 
the RCCs terminate by their terms) unless, subject to 
certain limitations, the Company has received net cash 
proceeds in specified amounts from the sale of 
common stock or certain other qualifying securities.  
The promises and covenants contained in the RCC will 
not apply if (i) S&P upgrades the Company’s issuer 
credit rating to A or above, (ii) the Company redeems 
the Debentures due to a tax event, (iii) after notice of 
redemption has been given by the Company and a 
market disruption event occurs preventing the 
Company from raising proceeds in accordance with the 
RCCs, or (iv) the Company repurchases or redeems up 
to 10% of the outstanding principal of the Debentures 
in any one-year period, provided that no more than 
25% will be so repurchased, redeemed or purchased in 
any ten-year period.

On May 16, 2017, a Redesignation Date occurred in 

accordance with the Series A RCCs.  As a result, the 
Corporation’s 7.45% Senior Notes due 2019 were no 
longer the covered debt under the Series A RCCs, and 
the 5.75% Subordinated Debentures due 2053 became 
the new covered debt.  On May 16, 2017, the Series B 
RCCs terminated pursuant to the terms of the Series B 
RCCs, and the obligations of the Corporation pursuant 
to the Series B RCCs expired.

The Series A RCCs terminate in 2067.  The RCCs 

will terminate prior to their scheduled termination date 
if (i) the applicable series of Debentures is no longer 
outstanding and the Company has fulfilled its 
obligations under the RCCs or they are no longer 
applicable, (ii) the holders of a majority of the then-
outstanding principal amount of the then-effective 
series of covered debt consent to agree to the 
termination of the RCCs, (iii) the Company does not 
have any series of outstanding debt that is eligible to 
be treated as covered debt under the RCCs, (iv) the 
applicable series of Debentures is accelerated as a 
result of an event of default, (v) certain rating agency or 
2017 Annual Report  253

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

change in control events occur, (vi) S&P, or any 
successor thereto, no longer assigns a solicited rating 
on senior debt issued or guaranteed by the Company, 
or (vii) the termination of the RCCs would have no 
effect on the equity credit provided by S&P with 
respect to the Debentures.  An event of default, as 
defined by the supplemental indenture, includes 
default in the payment of interest or principal and 
bankruptcy proceedings.

To manage short-term liquidity, the Company 

maintains a commercial paper program and a credit 
facility as a potential source of funds.  These include a 
$1.00 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and a 
commercial paper program with a borrowing limit of 
$1.00 billion.  In April 2016, the Company extended the 
maturity date of the facility to April 2021.  This facility 
contains an increase provision that would allow up to 
an additional $500 million of borrowing.  This facility 
has a financial covenant requiring the Company not to 
exceed a 37.5% debt to capitalization ratio as defined in 
the agreement.  Although the right to borrow under 
the facility is not subject to a minimum rating 
requirement, the costs of maintaining the facility and 
borrowing under it are based on the ratings of the 
Company’s senior unsecured, unguaranteed long-term 
debt.  The total amount outstanding at any point in 
time under the combination of the commercial paper 
program and the credit facility cannot exceed the 
amount that can be borrowed under the credit facility.  
No amounts were outstanding under the credit facility 
as of December 31, 2017 or 2016.  The Company had no 
commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2017 
or 2016.

Outstanding preferred stock as of December 31, 2017

The Company paid $332 million, $287 million and 

$289 million of interest on debt in 2017, 2016 and 2015, 
respectively.

The Company had $169 million and $132 million of 

investment-related debt that is reported in other 
liabilities and accrued expenses as of December 31, 
2017 and 2016, respectively.  Of the $132 million, $45 
million related to a commitment to fund a limited 
partnership as of December 31, 2016.

During 2015, the Company filed a universal shelf 

registration statement with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission (“SEC”) that expires in 2018.  
The registration statement covers an unspecified 
amount of securities and can be used to issue debt 
securities, common stock, preferred stock, depositary 
shares, warrants, stock purchase contracts, stock 
purchase units and securities of trust subsidiaries.

Common stock  The Company had 900 million 
shares of issued common stock of which 355 million 
shares were outstanding and 545 million shares were 
held in treasury as of December 31, 2017.  In 2017, the 
Company reacquired 16 million shares at an average 
cost of $89.95 and reissued 5 million net shares under 
equity incentive plans.

Preferred stock  All outstanding preferred stock 
represents noncumulative perpetual preferred stock 
with a $1.00 par value per share and a liquidation 
preference of $25,000 per share.

The preferred stock ranks senior to the Company’s 

common stock with respect to the payment of 
dividends and liquidation rights.  The Company will pay 
dividends on the preferred stock on a noncumulative 
basis only when, as and if declared by the Company’s 
board of directors (or a duly authorized committee of 
the board) and to the extent that the Company has 
legally available funds to pay dividends.  If dividends 
are declared on the preferred stock, they will be 
payable quarterly in arrears at an annual fixed rate.  
Dividends on the preferred stock are not cumulative.  
Accordingly, in the event dividends are not declared on 
the preferred stock for payment on any dividend 
payment date, then those dividends will cease to be 
payable.  If the Company has not declared a dividend 
before the dividend payment date for any dividend 
period, the Company has no obligation to pay 
dividends for that dividend period, whether or not 
254  
254  

  www.allstate.com

dividends are declared for any future dividend period.  
No dividends may be paid or declared on the 
Company’s common stock and no shares of the 
Company’s common stock may be repurchased unless 
the full dividends for the latest completed dividend 
period on the preferred stock have been declared and 
paid or provided for.

The Company is prohibited from declaring or 

paying dividends on preferred stock in excess of the 
amount of net proceeds from an issuance of common 
stock taking place within 90 days before a dividend 
declaration date if, on that dividend declaration date, 
either: (1) the risk-based capital ratios of the largest 
U.S. property-casualty insurance subsidiaries that 
collectively account for 80% or more of the net written 
premiums of U.S. property-casualty insurance business 
on a weighted average basis were less than 175% of 

their company action level risk-based capital as of the 
end of the most recent year; or (2) consolidated net 
income for the four-quarter period ending on the 
preliminary quarter end test date (the quarter that is 
two quarters prior to the most recently completed 
quarter) is zero or negative and consolidated 
shareholders’ equity (excluding AOCI, and subject to 
certain other adjustments relating to changes in 
U.S. GAAP) as of each of the preliminary quarter test 
date and the most recently completed quarter has 
declined by 20% or more from its level as measured at 
the end of the benchmark quarter (the date that is ten 
quarters prior to the most recently completed quarter).  
If the Company fails to satisfy either of these tests on 
any dividend declaration date, the restrictions on 
dividends will continue until the Company is able again 
to satisfy the test on a dividend declaration date.  In 
addition, in the case of a restriction arising under 
(2) above, the restrictions on dividends will continue 
until consolidated shareholders’ equity (excluding 
AOCI, and subject to certain other adjustments relating 
to changes in U.S. GAAP) has increased, or has 
declined by less than 20%, in either case as compared 
to its level at the end of the benchmark quarter for 
each dividend payment date as to which dividend 
restrictions were imposed.

The preferred stock does not have voting rights 

except with respect to certain changes in the terms of 
the preferred stock, in the case of certain dividend 
nonpayments, certain other fundamental corporate 

Note 13 Company Restructuring

The Company undertakes various programs to 

reduce expenses.  These programs generally involve a 
reduction in staffing levels, and in certain cases, office 
closures.  Restructuring and related charges primarily 
include employee severance and relocation benefits, 
and post-exit rent expenses in connection with these 
programs, and non-cash charges resulting from 
pension benefit payments made to agents and certain 
legal expenses and settlements incurred in connection 
with the 1999 reorganization of Allstate’s multiple 
agency programs to a single exclusive agency 
program.  The expenses related to these activities are

provided by law.  If and when dividends have not been 
declared and paid in full for at least six quarterly 
dividend periods or their equivalent (whether or not 
consecutive), the authorized number of directors then 
constituting our board of directors will be increased by 
two.  The holders of the preferred stock, together with 
the holders of all other affected classes and series of

conditions.  The board of directors shall at no time 
have more than two preferred stock directors.

The preferred stock is perpetual and has no 

maturity date.  The preferred stock is redeemable at 
the Company’s option in whole or in part, on or after 
June 15, 2018 for Series A, October 15, 2018 for 
Series C, April 15, 2019 for Series D and E, and 
October 15, 2019 for Series F, at a redemption price of 
$25,000 per share of preferred stock, plus declared

Series A, October 15, 2018 for Series C, April 15, 2019 for 
Series D and E, and October 15, 2019 for Series F, the 
preferred stock is redeemable at the Company’s 
option, in whole but not in part, within 90 days of the 
occurrence of certain rating agency events at a 
redemption price equal to $25,000 per share or, if 
greater, a make-whole redemption price, plus declared 
and unpaid dividends.

included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations 
as restructuring and related charges, and totaled $109 
million, $30 million and $39 million in 2017, 2016 and 
2015, respectively.  Restructuring expenses in 2017 
primarily related to Allstate brand claims process 
changes and office closures due to increased 
efficiencies and improvements in digital technology, a 
voluntary termination program extended to certain 
employees, outsourcing of certain functions, legal 
expenses and settlements, as well as realigning or 
consolidating departments within the Allstate,

Shared markets and state facility assessments

The Company is required to participate in assigned 

risk plans, reinsurance facilities and joint underwriting 
associations in various states that provide insurance 
coverage to individuals or entities that otherwise are 
unable to purchase such coverage from private 
insurers.  Underwriting results related to these 
arrangements, which tend to be adverse, have been 
immaterial to the Company’s results of operations.  
Because of the Company’s participation, it may be 
exposed to losses that surpass the capitalization of 
these facilities and/or assessments from these 
facilities.

Florida Citizens  Castle Key is subject to 

assessments from Citizens Property Insurance 
Corporation in the state of Florida (“FL Citizens”), which 
was initially created by the state of Florida to provide 
insurance to property owners unable to obtain 
coverage in the private insurance market.  FL Citizens, 
at the discretion and direction of its Board of 
Governors (“FL Citizens Board”), can levy a regular 
assessment on assessable insurers and assessable 
insureds for a deficit in any calendar year up to a 
maximum of the greater of: 2% of the projected deficit 
or 2% of the aggregate statewide direct written 
premium for the prior calendar year.  The base of 
assessable insurers includes all property and casualty 
premiums in the state, except workers’ compensation, 
medical malpractice, accident and health insurance 
and policies written under the NFIP.  An insurer may 
recoup a regular assessment through a surcharge to 
policyholders.  In order to recoup this assessment, an 
insurer must file for a policy surcharge with the Florida 
Office of Insurance Regulation (“FL OIR”) at least fifteen 
days prior to imposing the surcharge on policies.  If a 
deficit remains after the regular assessment, FL 
Citizens’ can also levy emergency assessments in the 
current and subsequent years.  Companies are 
256  
256  

  www.allstate.com
  www.allstate.com

required to collect the emergency assessments 
directly from residential property policyholders and 
remit to FL Citizens as collected.  Pursuant to an Order 
issued by the FL OIR, the emergency assessment is 
zero for all policies issued or renewed on or after July 1, 
2015.  FL Citizens’s initial estimates indicated sufficient 
resources to cover the losses from Hurricane Irma 
which will not result in the levy of an assessment.

Louisiana Citizens  The Company is also subject to 

assessments from Louisiana Citizens Property 
Insurance Corporation (“LA Citizens”).  LA Citizens can 
levy a regular assessment on participating companies 
for a deficit in any calendar year up to a maximum of 
the greater of 10% of the calendar year deficit or 10% of 
Louisiana direct property premiums industry-wide for 
the prior calendar year.  If the plan year deficit exceeds 
the amount that can be recovered through Regular 
Assessments, LA Citizens may fund the remaining 
deficit by issuing revenue assessment bonds in the 
capital markets.  LA Citizens then declares Emergency 
Assessments each year to provide debt service on the 
bonds until they are retired.  Companies writing 
assessable lines must surcharge their policyholders 
Emergency Assessments in the percentage 
established annually by LA Citizens and must remit 
amounts collected to the bond trustee on a quarterly 
basis.  Emergency assessments to pay off bonds 
issued in 2007 for the hurricanes of 2005 will continue 
until 2025.

Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund  Castle Key 
participates in the mandatory coverage provided by 
the FHCF and therefore has access to reimbursements 
on certain qualifying Florida hurricane losses from the 
FHCF (see Note 10), and has exposure to assessments 
and pays annual premiums to the FHCF for this 
reimbursement protection.  The FHCF has the 
authority to issue bonds to pay its obligations to 
insurers participating in the mandatory coverage in 
excess of its capital balances.  Payment of these bonds 
is funded by emergency assessments on all property 
and casualty premiums in the state, except workers’ 
compensation, medical malpractice, accident and 
health insurance and policies written under the NFIP.  
The FHCF emergency assessments are limited to 6% of 
premiums per year beginning the first year in which 
reimbursements require bonding, and up to a total of 
10% of premiums per year for assessments in the 
second and subsequent years, if required to fund 
additional bonding.  Pursuant to an Order issued by the 
FL OIR, the emergency assessment is zero for all 
policies issued or renewed on or after January 1, 2015.  
The FHCF issued $2 billion in pre-event bonds in 2013 
to build their capacity to reimburse member 
companies’ claims.  The FHCF plans to fund these pre-
event bonds through current FHCF cash flows.

Facilities such as FL Citizens, LA Citizens and the 
FHCF are generally designed so that the ultimate cost 
is borne by policyholders; however, the exposure to 
assessments from these facilities and the availability of 
recoupments or premium rate increases may not offset 
each other in the Company’s financial statements.  

Moreover, even if they do offset each other, they may 
not offset each other in financial statements for the 
same fiscal period due to the ultimate timing of the 
assessments and recoupments or premium rate 
increases, as well as the possibility of policies not being 
renewed in subsequent years.

California Earthquake Authority  Exposure to 

certain potential losses from earthquakes in California 
is limited by the Company’s participation in the 
California Earthquake Authority (“CEA”), which provides 
insurance for California earthquake losses.  The CEA is 
a privately-financed, publicly-managed state agency 
created to provide insurance coverage for earthquake 
damage.  Insurers selling homeowners insurance in 
California are required to offer earthquake insurance to 
their customers either through their company or by 
participation in the CEA.  The Company’s homeowners 
policies continue to include coverages for losses 
caused by explosions, theft, glass breakage and fires 
following an earthquake, which are not underwritten by 
the CEA.

As of September 30, 2017, the CEA’s capital 

balance was approximately $5.43 billion.  Should losses 
arising from an earthquake cause a deficit in the CEA, 
an additional $685 million would be obtained from the 
proceeds of revenue bonds the CEA may issue, an 
existing $7.51 billion reinsurance layer, and finally, if 
needed, assessments on participating insurance 
companies.  Participating insurers are required to pay 
an assessment, currently estimated not to exceed 
$1.66 billion, if the capital of the CEA falls below $350 
million.  Participating insurers are required to pay a 
second additional assessment, currently estimated not 
to exceed $54 million, if aggregate CEA earthquake 
losses exceed $15.33 billion and the capital of the CEA 
falls below $350 million.  Within the limits previously 
described, the assessment could be intended to 
restore the CEA’s capital to a level of $350 million.  
There is no provision that allows insurers to recover 
assessments through a premium surcharge or other 
mechanism.  The CEA’s projected aggregate claim 
paying capacity is $15.33 billion as of September 30, 
2017 and if an event were to result in claims greater 
than its capacity, affected policyholders may be paid a 
prorated portion of their covered losses, paid on an 
installment basis, or no payments may be made if the 
claim paying capacity of the CEA is insufficient.

All future assessments on participating CEA 

insurers are based on their CEA insurance market 
share as of December 31 of the preceding year.  As of 
December 31, 2016, the Company’s market share was 
11.2%.  The Company does not expect its market share 
to materially change.  At this level, the Company’s 
maximum possible CEA assessment would be $191 
million during 2018.  These amounts are re-evaluated 
by the board of directors of the CEA on an annual 
basis.  Accordingly, assessments from the CEA for a 
particular quarter or annual period may be material to 
the results of operations and cash flows, but not the 
financial position of the Company.  Management 
believes the Company’s exposure to earthquake losses 
in California has been significantly reduced as a result 
of its participation in the CEA.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

Texas Windstorm Insurance Association  The 
Company participates as a member of the Texas 
Windstorm Insurance Association (“TWIA”), which 
provides wind and hail property coverage to coastal 
risks unable to procure coverage in the voluntary 
market.  Wind and hail coverage is written on a TWIA-
issued policy.  TWIA follows a funding structure first 
utilizing currently available funds set aside from 
current and prior years.  Under the current law, to the 
extent losses exceed premiums received from 
policyholders, TWIA utilizes a combination of 
reinsurance and TWIA issued securities to fund its 
payments of losses.  Reinsurance is procured annually 
in an amount determined by the TWIA board.  Once 
those currently available funds and available 
reinsurance are utilized, TWIA could issue up to $1 
billion of securities, which will be repaid by billing 
policyholders and assessing participating insurers.  The 
Company’s current participation ratio is approximately 
13.6% based upon its proportion of the premiums 
written.  Any assessments from TWIA for a particular 
quarter or annual period may be material to the results 
of operations and cash flows, but not the financial 
position of the Company.

Texas Fair Plan Association  The Company 

participates as a member of the Texas Fair Plan 
Association (“FAIR Plan”), which provides residential 
property insurance to inland areas designated as 
underserved by the Commissioner of Insurance and the 
applicant(s) are unable to procure coverage in the 
voluntary market.  The FAIR Plan issues insurance 
policies, like an insurance company, and it also 
functions as a pooling mechanism that allocates 
premiums, claims and expenses back to the insurance 
industry.  As a result of the losses incurred related to 
Hurricane Harvey, the FAIR Plan Board unanimously 
voted to approve its first ever member assessment of 
which the Company’s share is expected to be $8 
million based on total direct premium written in Texas.  
The Company's portion of the assessment was 
recorded as a liability as of December 31, 2017.  Insurers 
are permitted to recover the assessment through 
either a premium surcharge applied to existing 
customers over a three-year period or increased rates, 
but the ability to fully recover the assessment may be 
impacted by market conditions or other factors.  

North Carolina Reinsurance Facility  The North 

Carolina Reinsurance Facility (“NCRF”) provides 
automobile liability insurance to drivers that insurers 
are not otherwise willing to insure.  All insurers licensed 
to write automobile insurance in North Carolina are 
members of the NCRF.  Premiums, losses and expenses 
are ceded to the NCRF.  North Carolina law allows the 
NCRF to recoup operating losses for certain insureds 
through a surcharge to policyholders.  As of September 
30, 2017, the NCRF reported a deficit of $310 million in 
members’ equity.  The NCRF implemented a loss 
recoupment surcharge on all private passenger policies 
becoming effective October 1, 2017 through March 31, 
2018.  Member companies are assessed the 
recoupment surcharge.  The loss recoupment 
surcharge will be adjusted at April 1, 2018 and 
discontinued once losses are recovered.  The NCRF 
results are shared by the member companies in 

2017 Annual Report  257

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

proportion to their respective North Carolina 
automobile liability writings.  As a result, the NCRF also 
has the ability to assess member Companies for 
recoupment of losses calculated on a pro-rata basis 
across member companies based on participation 
ratios, determined annually.  For fiscal year ending 
September 30, 2017, the net loss was $50 million, 
including $1.0 billion of earned premiums, $173 million 
of certain private passenger auto risk recoupment and 
$149 million of member loss recoupments.  As of 
December 31, 2017, the NCRF reinsurance recoverable 
on paid claims is $12.5 million and reinsurance 
recoverable on unpaid claims is $73.8 million.  Paid 
recoverable balances, if covered, are typically settled 
within sixty days of monthly filing.

North Carolina Joint Underwriters Association  The 

North Carolina Joint Underwriters Association 
(“NCJUA”) was created to provide property insurance 
for properties (other than the state’s beach and coastal 
areas) that insurers are not otherwise willing to insure.  
All insurers licensed to write property insurance in 
North Carolina are members of the NCJUA.  Premiums, 
losses and expenses of the NCJUA are shared by the 
member companies in proportion to their respective 
North Carolina property insurance writings.  Member 
companies participate in plan deficits or surpluses 
based on their participation ratios, which are 
determined annually.  The Company had a $4.6 million 
receivable from the NCJUA at December 31, 2017, 
representing our participation in the NCJUA’s surplus 
of $37.8 million for all open years.

North Carolina Insurance Underwriting Association  
The North Carolina Insurance Underwriting Association 
(“NCIUA”) provides windstorm and hail coverage as well 
as homeowners policies for properties located in the 
state’s beach and coastal areas that insurers are not 
otherwise willing to insure.  All insurers licensed to 
write residential and commercial property insurance in 
North Carolina are members of the NCIUA.  Members 
are assessed in proportion to their North Carolina 
residential and commercial property insurance 
writings, which is determined annually and varies by 
coverage, for plan deficits.  As of December 31, 2017, 
the NCIUA had a surplus of $1.5 billion.  No member 
company shall be entitled to the distribution of any 
portion of the Association’s surplus.  The Company 
does not recognize any interest related to this surplus.  
Legislation in 2009 capped insurers’ assessments for 
losses incurred in any calendar year at $1 billion.  
Subsequent to an industry assessment of $1 billion, if 
the plan continues to require funding, it may authorize 
insurers to assess a 10% catastrophe recovery charge 
on each property insurance policy statewide to be 
remitted to the plan.
Guaranty funds

Under state insurance guaranty fund laws, insurers 

doing business in a state can be assessed, up to 
prescribed limits, for certain obligations of insolvent 
insurance companies to policyholders and claimants.  
Amounts assessed to each company are typically 
related to its proportion of business written in each 
state.  The Company’s policy is to accrue assessments 
when the entity for which the insolvency relates has 
258  

  www.allstate.com

met its state of domicile’s statutory definition of 
insolvency, the amount of the loss is reasonably 
estimable and the related premium upon which the 
assessment is based is written.  In most states, the 
definition is met with a declaration of financial 
insolvency by a court of competent jurisdiction.  In 
certain states there must also be a final order of 
liquidation.  As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the 
liability balance included in other liabilities and accrued 
expenses was $12 million and $4 million, respectively.  
The related premium tax offsets included in other 
assets were $19 million and $9 million as of 
December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Guarantees

The Company provides residual value guarantees 

on Company leased automobiles.  If all outstanding 
leases were terminated effective December 31, 2017, 
the Company’s maximum obligation pursuant to these 
guarantees, assuming the automobiles have no 
residual value, would be $27 million as of December 31, 
2017.  The remaining term of each residual value 
guarantee is equal to the term of the underlying lease 
that ranges from less than one year to four years.  
Historically, the Company has not made any material 
payments pursuant to these guarantees.

Related to the sale of LBL on April 1, 2014, ALIC 
agreed to indemnify Resolution Life Holdings, Inc. in 
connection with certain  representations, warranties 
and covenants of ALIC, and certain liabilities 
specifically excluded from the transaction, subject to 
specific contractual limitations regarding ALIC’s 
maximum obligation.  Management does not believe 
these indemnifications will have a material effect on 
results of operations, cash flows or financial position of 
the Company.

Related to the disposal through reinsurance of 
substantially all of its variable annuity business to 
Prudential in 2006, the Company and its consolidated 
subsidiaries, ALIC and ALNY, have agreed to indemnify 
Prudential for certain pre-closing contingent liabilities 
(including extra-contractual liabilities of ALIC and ALNY 
and liabilities specifically excluded from the 
transaction) that ALIC and ALNY have agreed to retain.  
In addition, the Company, ALIC and ALNY will each 
indemnify Prudential for certain post-closing liabilities 
that may arise from the acts of ALIC, ALNY and their 
agents, including certain liabilities arising from ALIC’s 
and ALNY’s provision of transition services.  The 
reinsurance agreements contain no limitations or 
indemnifications with regard to insurance risk transfer 
and transferred all of the future risks and 
responsibilities for performance on the underlying 
variable annuity contracts to Prudential, including 
those related to benefit guarantees.  Management 
does not believe this agreement will have a material 
effect on results of operations, cash flows or financial 
position of the Company.

In the normal course of business, the Company 
provides standard indemnifications to contractual 
counterparties in connection with numerous 
transactions, including acquisitions and divestitures.  
The types of indemnifications typically provided 

include indemnifications for breaches of 
representations and warranties, taxes and certain 
other liabilities, such as third party lawsuits.  The 
indemnification clauses are often standard contractual 
terms and are entered into in the normal course of 
business based on an assessment that the risk of loss 
would be remote.  The terms of the indemnifications 
vary in duration and nature.  In many cases, the 
maximum obligation is not explicitly stated and the 
contingencies triggering the obligation to indemnify 
have not occurred and are not expected to occur.  
Consequently, the maximum amount of the obligation 
under such indemnifications is not determinable.  
Historically, the Company has not made any material 
payments pursuant to these obligations.

The aggregate liability balance related to all 

guarantees was not material as of December 31, 2017.

Regulation and compliance

The Company is subject to extensive laws, 

regulations, administrative directives, and regulatory 
actions.  From time to time, regulatory authorities or 
legislative bodies seek to influence and restrict 
premium rates, require premium refunds to 
policyholders, require reinstatement of terminated 
policies, prescribe rules or guidelines on how affiliates 
compete in the marketplace, restrict the ability of 
insurers to cancel or non-renew policies, require 
insurers to continue to write new policies or limit their 
ability to write new policies, limit insurers’ ability to 
change coverage terms or to impose underwriting 
standards, impose additional regulations regarding 
agent and broker compensation, regulate the nature of 
and amount of investments, impose fines and penalties 
for unintended errors or mistakes, and otherwise 
expand overall regulation of insurance products and 
the insurance industry.  In addition, the Company is 
subject to laws and regulations administered and 
enforced by federal agencies and other organizations, 
including but not limited to the Securities and 
Exchange Commission, the Financial Industry 
Regulatory Authority, the Department of Labor, the 
U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and 
the U.S. Department of Justice.  The Company has 
established procedures and policies to facilitate 
compliance with laws and regulations, to foster 
prudent business operations, and to support financial 
reporting.  The Company routinely reviews its practices 
to validate compliance with laws and regulations and 
with internal procedures and policies.  As a result of 
these reviews, from time to time the Company may 
decide to modify some of its procedures and policies.  
Such modifications, and the reviews that led to them, 
may be accompanied by payments being made and 
costs being incurred.  The ultimate changes and 
eventual effects of these actions on the Company’s 
business, if any, are uncertain.

Legal and regulatory proceedings and inquiries

The Company and certain subsidiaries are involved 
in a number of lawsuits, regulatory inquiries, and other 
legal proceedings arising out of various aspects of its 
business.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

Background  These matters raise difficult and 

complicated factual and legal issues and are subject to 
many uncertainties and complexities, including the 
underlying facts of each matter; novel legal issues; 
variations between jurisdictions in which matters are 
being litigated, heard, or investigated; changes in 
assigned judges; differences or developments in 
applicable laws and judicial interpretations; judges 
reconsidering prior rulings; the length of time before 
many of these matters might be resolved by 
settlement, through litigation, or otherwise; 
adjustments with respect to anticipated trial schedules 
and other proceedings; developments in similar 
actions against other companies; the fact that some of 
the lawsuits are putative class actions in which a class 
has not been certified and in which the purported class 
may not be clearly defined; the fact that some of the 
lawsuits involve multi-state class actions in which the 
applicable law(s) for the claims at issue is in dispute 
and therefore unclear; and the challenging legal 
environment faced by corporations and insurance 
companies.

The outcome of these matters may be affected by 
decisions, verdicts, and settlements, and the timing of 
such decisions, verdicts, and settlements, in other 
individual and class action lawsuits that involve the 
Company, other insurers, or other entities and by other 
legal, governmental, and regulatory actions that 
involve the Company, other insurers, or other entities.  
The outcome may also be affected by future state or 
federal legislation, the timing or substance of which 
cannot be predicted.

In the lawsuits, plaintiffs seek a variety of remedies 

which may include equitable relief in the form of 
injunctive and other remedies and monetary relief in 
the form of contractual and extra-contractual 
damages.  In some cases, the monetary damages 
sought may include punitive or treble damages.  Often 
specific information about the relief sought, such as 
the amount of damages, is not available because 
plaintiffs have not requested specific relief in their 
pleadings.  When specific monetary demands are 
made, they are often set just below a state court 
jurisdictional limit in order to seek the maximum 
amount available in state court, regardless of the 
specifics of the case, while still avoiding the risk of 
removal to federal court.  In Allstate’s experience, 
monetary demands in pleadings bear little relation to 
the ultimate loss, if any, to the Company.

In connection with regulatory examinations and 

proceedings, government authorities may seek various 
forms of relief, including penalties, restitution, and 
changes in business practices.  The Company may not 
be advised of the nature and extent of relief sought 
until the final stages of the examination or proceeding.

Accrual and disclosure policy  The Company 

reviews its lawsuits, regulatory inquiries, and other 
legal proceedings on an ongoing basis and follows 
appropriate accounting guidance when making accrual 
and disclosure decisions.  The Company establishes 
accruals for such matters at management’s best 
estimate when the Company assesses that it is 
probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount 
2017 Annual Report  259

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

of the loss can be reasonably estimated.  The Company 
does not establish accruals for such matters when the 
Company does not believe both that it is probable that 
a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss 
can be reasonably estimated.  The Company’s 
assessment of whether a loss is reasonably possible or 
probable is based on its assessment of the ultimate 
outcome of the matter following all appeals.  The 
Company does not include potential recoveries in its 
estimates of reasonably possible or probable losses.  
Legal fees are expensed as incurred.

The Company continues to monitor its lawsuits, 
regulatory inquiries, and other legal proceedings for 
further developments that would make the loss 
contingency both probable and estimable, and 
accordingly accruable, or that could affect the amount 
of accruals that have been previously established.  
There may continue to be exposure to loss in excess of 
any amount accrued.  Disclosure of the nature and 
amount of an accrual is made when there have been 
sufficient legal and factual developments such that the 
Company’s ability to resolve the matter would not be 
impaired by the disclosure of the amount of accrual.

When the Company assesses it is reasonably 

possible or probable that a loss has been incurred, it 
discloses the matter.  When it is possible to estimate 
the reasonably possible loss or range of loss above the 
amount accrued, if any, for the matters disclosed, that 
estimate is aggregated and disclosed.  Disclosure is 
not required when an estimate of the reasonably 
possible loss or range of loss cannot be made.

For certain of the matters described below in the 
“Claims related proceedings” and “Other proceedings” 
subsections, the Company is able to estimate the 
reasonably possible loss or range of loss above the 
amount accrued, if any.  In determining whether it is 
possible to estimate the reasonably possible loss or 
range of loss, the Company reviews and evaluates the 
disclosed matters, in conjunction with counsel, in light 
of potentially relevant factual and legal developments.

These developments may include information 
learned through the discovery process, rulings on 
dispositive motions, settlement discussions, 
information obtained from other sources, experience 
from managing these and other matters, and other 
rulings by courts, arbitrators or others.  When the 
Company possesses sufficient appropriate information 
to develop an estimate of the reasonably possible loss 
or range of loss above the amount accrued, if any, that 
estimate is aggregated and disclosed below.  There 
may be other disclosed matters for which a loss is 
probable or reasonably possible but such an estimate 
is not possible.  Disclosure of the estimate of the 
reasonably possible loss or range of loss above the 
amount accrued, if any, for any individual matter would 
only be considered when there have been sufficient 
legal and factual developments such that the 
Company’s ability to resolve the matter would not be 
impaired by the disclosure of the individual estimate.

The Company currently estimates that the 

aggregate range of reasonably possible loss in excess 
of the amount accrued, if any, for the disclosed matters 
260  
260  

  www.allstate.com
  www.allstate.com

where such an estimate is possible is zero to $240 
million, pre-tax.  This disclosure is not an indication of 
expected loss, if any.  Under accounting guidance, an 
event is “reasonably possible” if “the chance of the 
future event or events occurring is more than remote 
but less than likely” and an event is “remote” if “the 
chance of the future event or events occurring is 
slight.”  This estimate is based upon currently available 
information and is subject to significant judgment and 
a variety of assumptions, and known and unknown 
uncertainties.  The matters underlying the estimate will 
change from time to time, and actual results may vary 
significantly from the current estimate.  The estimate 
does not include matters or losses for which an 
estimate is not possible.  Therefore, this estimate 
represents an estimate of possible loss only for certain 
matters meeting these criteria.  It does not represent 
the Company’s maximum possible loss exposure.  
Information is provided below regarding the nature of 
all of the disclosed matters and, where specified, the 
amount, if any, of plaintiff claims associated with these 
loss contingencies.

Due to the complexity and scope of the matters 

disclosed in the “Claims related proceedings” and 
“Other proceedings” subsections below and the many 
uncertainties that exist, the ultimate outcome of these 
matters cannot be predicted and in the Company’s 
judgment, a loss, in excess of amounts accrued, if any, 
is not probable.  In the event of an unfavorable 
outcome in one or more of these matters, the ultimate 
liability may be in excess of amounts currently accrued, 
if any, and may be material to the Company’s operating 
results or cash flows for a particular quarterly or annual 
period.  However, based on information currently 
known to it, management believes that the ultimate 
outcome of all matters described below, as they are 
resolved over time, is not likely to have a material 
effect on the financial position of the Company.

Claims related proceedings  

The Company is litigating a class action case in 
California in which the plaintiffs allege off-the-clock 
wage and hour claims.  Plaintiffs seek recovery of 
unpaid compensation, liquidated damages, penalties, 
and attorneys’ fees and costs.  

The case of Jack Jimenez, et al. v. Allstate 

Insurance Company was filed in the U.S. District Court 
for the Central District of California in September 2010.  
The plaintiffs allege that they worked off-the-clock; 
they also allege other California Labor Code violations 
resulting from purported unpaid overtime.  In April 
2012, the court certified a class that includes all 
adjusters in the state of California, except auto field 
adjusters, from September 29, 2006 to final judgment.  
Allstate appealed the court’s decision to certify the 
class, first to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and 
then to the U.S. Supreme Court.  The case was 
scheduled for trial on September 27, 2016.  On May 4, 
2016, the court vacated that trial date in part because 
the court had not approved a trial plan.  No trial date 
has been scheduled because the parties continue to 
wait for the court’s approval of a trial plan. 

In addition to the California class action, the case 

of Maria Victoria Perez and Kaela Brown, et al. v. 
Allstate Insurance Company was filed in the U.S. District 
Court for the Eastern District of New York.  Plaintiffs 
allege that no-fault claim adjusters have been 
improperly classified as exempt employees under New 
York Labor Law and the Fair Labor Standards Act.  The 
case was filed in April 2011, and the plaintiffs are 
seeking unpaid wages, liquidated damages, injunctive 
relief, compensatory and punitive damages, and 
attorneys’ fees.  On September 16, 2014, the court 
certified a class of no-fault adjusters under New York 
Labor Law and refused to decertify a Fair Labor 
Standards Act class of no-fault adjusters.  There are 
105 members of the Fair Labor Standards Act class and 
137 members of the New York Labor Law class.  The 
parties are concluding discovery and preparing to seek 
court approval to file motions for summary judgment. 

Other proceedings  The Company is defending a 

consolidated proceeding relating to the reorganization 
of its agent sales force in 2000, when the Company 
discontinued employee agent programs, terminated 
the contracts of its employee agents, and offered 
those agents the opportunity to become Allstate 
Exclusive Agent independent contractors or to take 
severance benefits in exchange for a release of claims. 
The consolidated proceeding, captioned Gene Romero, 
et al. v. Allstate Insurance Company, et al., is pending in 
the United States District Court for the Eastern District 
of Pennsylvania. 

This matter has a long and complex history, only 
relevant portions of which are summarized here. The 
case began in 2001 as two separate putative class 
actions filed by approximately 32 former employee 
agents.  In one case, plaintiffs challenged the 
reorganization alleging claims under the Age 
Discrimination in Employment Act (“ADEA”), 
interference with benefits under ERISA, breach of 
contract, and breach of fiduciary duty.  Plaintiffs also 
challenged the release of claims on various grounds 
including alleging that the release was retaliatory 
under the ADEA and ERISA.  In the other case, plaintiffs 
challenged certain amendments to the Agents Pension 
Plan and sought to have service as Exclusive Agent 
independent contractors count toward eligibility for 
benefits.  Plaintiffs sought various relief, including back 
pay, compensatory and punitive damages, liquidated 
damages, lost investment capital, loss of benefits, 
repeal of the challenged plan amendments and 
attorneys’ fees. 

In February, 2014, the court addressed the validity 
and enforceability of the release and determined that 
the question of whether the releases were voluntarily 
signed raised disputed issues of fact to be resolved at 
trial.  The court also held that the release, if valid, 
would bar all claims.  In late 2014, the court denied 
plaintiffs’ motion to certify a class for purposes of 
determining whether the releases were signed 
voluntarily and ordered that all statutes of limitations 
would resume running, after which approximately 460 
additional individual plaintiffs filed separate similar 
lawsuits or sought to intervene.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

A jury trial was held in June, 2015, to determine 

whether the releases of ten plaintiffs were knowingly 
and voluntarily signed.  The jury found that two 
plaintiffs signed their releases voluntarily and eight 
plaintiffs did not. 

On May 2, 2016, a consolidated amended 

complaint was filed on behalf of 498 plaintiffs, most of 
whom had previously filed separate lawsuits or 
intervened.  On July 6, 2016, the court denied the 
Company’s motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ state law 
breach of contract and fiduciary duty claims but 
granted dismissal of plaintiffs’ retaliation claims under 
the ADEA and ERISA challenging the release of claims.

The court then separated the case into phases to 

address “common issues” in plaintiffs’ claims, 
beginning with: (a) “Phase I” addressing claims by 118 
plaintiffs alleging that certain plan amendments 
violated ERISA’s anti-cutback provision by eliminating 
an accrued benefit and (b) “Phase II” addressing all 
plaintiffs’ claims for alleged interference with employee 
benefits under ERISA and disparate impact under the 
ADEA.  

A bench trial on Phase I claims was held in 

December, 2016.  The court ruled that (i) the Company’s 
1991 amendments to the Plan did not violate ERISA by 
improperly cutting back on plaintiffs’ benefits, and (ii) 
the Company’s interpretation of the Plan’s definition of 
“retire” violated ERISA’s anti-cutback rule.  The court 
required the parties to provide further information, in 
the form of an accounting, to determine whether any 
plaintiffs suffered a loss based on any such cutback. 
Plaintiffs have asserted that only two of the 118 
plaintiffs suffered a loss as a result of the court’s order.  
The Company contends that no plaintiff suffered a 
compensable loss and that judgment should be 
entered in favor of the Company.  We await a final 
ruling by the court.  

In Phase II, the court granted the Company’s 
motion for summary judgment on both the ADEA 
disparate impact and ERISA interference with benefits 
claims.  This ruling resolved these claims in the trial 
court as to all plaintiffs.

In June, 2017, the court entered an order 

establishing Phases III and IV of the litigation.  In Phase 
III, the remaining claims of the eight individual plaintiffs 
who reside in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania were 
to be litigated, possibly culminating in two separate 
jury trials in early 2018.  The Company filed several 
motions for summary judgment on the Phase III claims.  
The court granted the Company’s motion as to the 
Phase III plaintiffs’ ADEA disparate treatment claims 
and as to a retaliation claim that had been asserted by 
one of the Phase III plaintiffs.  The court denied the 
Company’s motion on the Phase III plaintiffs’ breach of 
contract and breach of fiduciary duty claims.

The Company and 85 individual plaintiffs, including 

all eight of the Phase III plaintiffs whose remaining 
claims were set for trial in early 2018, reached 
agreements in principle to settle all claims of those 
plaintiffs on a confidential basis, subject to negotiating 
and executing appropriate written settlement

agreements.  Four other plaintiffs have voluntarily 
dismissed their claims leaving 410 plaintiffs in this 
litigation.  

The parties have substantially completed written 

discovery relating to the claims of the remaining 
plaintiffs (Phase IV of the litigation).  On January 30, 
2018, the court decided two separate summary 
judgment motions filed by the Company with respect 
to the Phase IV claims. The court (i) granted summary 
judgment in the Company’s favor on the claims by 
twenty-seven Phase IV plaintiffs alleging that the 
Company improperly retaliated against them by filing 
counterclaims to their original complaint; and (ii) 
declined to decide whether the remaining Phase IV 
plaintiffs’ age discrimination (disparate treatment) 
claims should be dismissed due to plaintiffs’ failure to 
exhaust administrative remedies, finding that this is 
not a common issue.  The court has yet to decide the 
proper venue for resolution of the remaining plaintiffs’ 
individual claims.

The final resolution of these matters is subject to 
various uncertainties and complexities including how 
trials, post-trial motions, possible appeals with respect 
to the validity of the release, and any rulings on the 
merits will be resolved.

The below shareholder derivative action is 

disclosed pursuant to SEC disclosure requirements for 
these types of matters, and the putative class action 
has been disclosed because both matters involve 
similar allegations.  On August 3, 2017, a plaintiff 
alleging to be a stockholder in the Company filed a 
shareholder derivative complaint in the Circuit Court 
for Cook County, Chancery Division.  The action is 
styled Biefeldt v. Wilson, et al., Case No. 2017 CH 10676 
(Cook County, Ill.).  In the complaint, plaintiff purports 
to assert claims on behalf of the Company for alleged 
breaches of fiduciary duty based on allegations that 
are similar to those asserted in the securities action 
described below.  The complaint names as defendants 
the Company’s chairman and chief executive officer, its 
former president, who retired on February 23, 2018, its 
former chief financial officer, who is now the Company’s 
vice chairman and the members of the board of 
directors during the period of the alleged 
misstatements or omissions regarding auto claims 
frequency.  Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the 
complaint on November 13, 2017.  The complaint seeks, 
on behalf of the Company, an unspecified amount of 
damages and various forms of equitable relief.

In November 2016, a putative class action was filed 

in the United States District Court for the Northern 
District of Illinois against the Company and several of 
its officers asserting claims under the federal securities 
laws.  The action is titled In re The Allstate Corp. 
Securities Litigation, No. 1:16-cv-10510 (N.D. Ill.).  In 
March 2017, lead plaintiffs filed a consolidated 
amended complaint.  In the complaint, plaintiffs allege 
that the Company and certain senior officers made 
allegedly material misstatements or omissions 
concerning claim frequency statistics and the reasons 
for a claim frequency increase for Allstate brand auto 
insurance during the period from October 29, 2014 to 
August 3, 2015.  The complaint further alleges that a 
262

senior officer engaged in stock option exercises and 
sales during that time allegedly while in possession of 
information about claim frequency that had not been 
disclosed.  The consolidated amended complaint 
names as defendants the Company, its chairman and 
chief executive officer and its former president.  
Plaintiffs assert claims under sections 10(b) and 20(a) of 
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 
promulgated thereunder.  On June 1, 2017, all 
defendants filed motions to dismiss the consolidated 
amended complaint for failure to state a claim.  
Briefing on the motion was completed in September 
2017.  The Company and the other defendants dispute 
plaintiffs’ allegations that there was any misstatement 
or omission or other misconduct.  The complaint seeks 
an unspecified amount of damages, costs and 
attorney’s fees and such other relief as the court 
deems appropriate.  

Asbestos and environmental

Management believes its net loss reserves for 

asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines 
exposures are appropriately established based on 
available facts, technology, laws and regulations.  
However, establishing net loss reserves for asbestos, 
environmental and other discontinued lines claims is 
subject to uncertainties that are much greater than 
those presented by other types of claims.  The ultimate 
cost of losses may vary materially from recorded 
amounts, which are based on management’s best 
estimate.  Among the complications are lack of 
historical data, long reporting delays, uncertainty as to 
the number and identity of insureds with potential 
exposure and unresolved legal issues regarding policy 
coverage; unresolved legal issues regarding the 
determination, availability and timing of exhaustion of 
policy limits; plaintiffs’ evolving and expanding theories 
of liability; availability and collectability of recoveries 
from reinsurance; retrospectively determined 
premiums and other contractual agreements; 
estimates of the extent and timing of any contractual 
liability; the impact of bankruptcy protection sought by 
various asbestos producers and other asbestos 
defendants; and other uncertainties.  There are also 
complex legal issues concerning the interpretation of 
various insurance policy provisions and whether those 
losses are covered, or were ever intended to be 
covered, and could be recoverable through 
retrospectively determined premium, reinsurance or 
other contractual agreements.  Courts have reached 
different and sometimes inconsistent conclusions as to 
when losses are deemed to have occurred and which 
policies provide coverage; what types of losses are 
covered; whether there is an insurer obligation to 
defend; how policy limits are determined; how policy 
exclusions and conditions are applied and interpreted; 
and whether clean-up costs represent insured property 
damage.  Further, insurers and claims administrators 
acting on behalf of insurers are increasingly pursuing 
evolving and expanding theories of reinsurance 
coverage for asbestos and environmental losses.  
Adjudication of reinsurance coverage is predominately 
decided in confidential arbitration proceedings which 
may have limited precedential or predictive value 
further complicating management’s ability to estimate 

probable loss for reinsured asbestos and 
environmental claims.  Management believes these 
issues are not likely to be resolved in the near future, 
and the ultimate costs may vary materially from the 
amounts currently recorded resulting in material 
changes in loss reserves.  In addition, while the 
Company believes that improved actuarial techniques 
and databases have assisted in its ability to estimate 

Note 15 Income Taxes

The Company and its domestic subsidiaries file a 
consolidated federal income tax return.  Tax liabilities 
and benefits realized by the consolidated group are 
allocated as generated by the respective entities.

The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) is currently 

examining the Company’s 2013 and 2014 federal 
income tax returns and the exam is expected to be 
complete in the first quarter of 2018.  The IRS has also 
begun their examination of the Company’s 2015 and 
2016 federal income tax returns.  The Company’s tax 
years prior to 2013 have been examined by the IRS and 
the statute of limitations has expired on those years.  
Any adjustments that may result from IRS 
examinations of the Company’s tax returns are not 
expected to have a material effect on the results of 
operations, cash flows or financial position of the 
Company.  

Tax Reform  On December 22, 2017, Public Law 
115-97, known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 
(“Tax Legislation”) became effective.  The Tax 
Legislation impacts the Company generally in four 
areas:

1.  Amends the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as 
amended, which among other items, permanently 
reduces the corporate income tax rate from a 
maximum of 35% to 21% beginning January 1, 2018. 

2.  Changes international taxation to a modified 

territorial tax system whereby profits from non-U.S. 
subsidiaries will generally be taxed only in their 
local jurisdictions. 

3.  Contains several other provisions, such as 

limitations of deductibility of executive 
compensation, meals and entertainment and 
lobbying expenses and changes to the dividends 
received deduction.

4.  Affects the timing of certain tax deductions for 

reserves and deferred acquisition costs, but does 
not impact the Company’s overall income tax 
expense.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

asbestos, environmental, and other discontinued lines 
net loss reserves, these refinements may subsequently 
prove to be inadequate indicators of the extent of 
probable losses.  Due to the uncertainties and factors 
described above, management believes it is not 
practicable to develop a meaningful range for any such 
additional net loss reserves that may be required.

Deferred income taxes result from temporary 

differences between the tax basis of assets and 
liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial 
statements that will result in taxable or deductible 
amounts in future years.  Deferred tax assets and 
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates 
expected to apply to taxable income in years in which 
those temporary differences are expected to be 
recovered or settled.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities 
are adjusted through income tax expense as changes 
in tax laws or rates are enacted.

The Company revalued its deferred tax assets and 

liabilities at the new corporate income tax rate.  The 
transition to the modified territorial system for 
international taxation required the Company to 
recognize a liability in 2017 based on non-U.S. income 
from international subsidiaries that had not been 
repatriated to their U.S. parent company (the 
“Transition Tax”).  The Company recorded a net tax 
benefit of $506 million, recognized as a reduction to 
income tax expense in the Company’s Consolidated 
Statements of Operations for the year ended 
December 31, 2017.  The net benefit was primarily due 
to re-measurement of the Company’s deferred tax 
assets and liabilities, partially offset by the impact of 
the transition tax on deemed repatriation of deferred 
non-U.S. income.  The Company’s effective income tax 
rate for 2017 was 20.1% and included this one-time 
benefit of 12.7%. 

The impact of the Tax Legislation may differ from 
the Company’s preliminary estimates due to, among 
other things, changes in interpretations and 
assumptions the Company has made, guidance that 
may be issued and actions the Company may take as a 
result of the Tax Legislation.  The transition tax 
calculation and the tax expense related to the rate 
differential on the deferred tax assets and liabilities of 
the foreign subsidiaries are based on estimated 
amounts.  Any potential adjustments made could be 
material in relation to the preliminary estimates 
recorded.

Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will 

be realized based on the Company’s assessment that the deductions ultimately recognized for tax purposes will be 
fully utilized.  As of December 31, 2017, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards of $238 million.  The Tax 
Legislation eliminated the 20-year limitation on carryforwards and made the carryforward period indefinite.

Note 16 Statutory Financial Information and Dividend Limitations

Allstate’s domestic property and casualty and life 

insurance subsidiaries prepare their statutory-basis 
financial statements in conformity with accounting 
practices prescribed or permitted by the insurance 
department of the applicable state of domicile.  
Prescribed statutory accounting practices include a 
variety of publications of the National Association of 
Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”), as well as state 
laws, regulations and general administrative rules.  
Permitted statutory accounting practices encompass 
all accounting practices not so prescribed.

All states require domiciled insurance companies 

to prepare statutory-basis financial statements in 

conformity with the NAIC Accounting Practices and 
Procedures Manual, subject to any deviations 
prescribed or permitted by the applicable insurance 
commissioner and/or director.  Statutory accounting 
practices differ from GAAP primarily since they require 
charging policy acquisition and certain sales 
inducement costs to expense as incurred, establishing 
life insurance reserves based on different actuarial 
assumptions, and valuing certain investments and 
establishing deferred taxes on a different basis.

Dividend Limitations

There are no regulatory restrictions that limit the 

payment of dividends by the Corporation, except those 
generally applicable to corporations incorporated in 
Delaware.  Dividends are payable only out of certain 
components of shareholders’ equity as permitted by 
Delaware law.  However, the ability of the Corporation 
to pay dividends is dependent on business conditions, 
income, cash requirements of the Company, receipt of 
dividends from AIC and other relevant factors.

The payment of shareholder dividends by AIC 

without the prior approval of the Illinois Department of 
Insurance (“IL DOI”) is limited to formula amounts 
based on net income and capital and surplus, 
determined in conformity with statutory accounting 
practices, as well as the timing and amount of 
dividends paid in the preceding twelve months.  AIC 
paid dividends of $1.56 billion in 2017.  The maximum 
amount of dividends AIC will be able to pay without 
prior IL DOI approval at a given point in time during

2018 is $2.87 billion, less dividends paid during the 
preceding twelve months measured at that point in 
time.  The payment of a dividend in excess of this 
amount requires 30 days advance written notice to the 
IL DOI.  The dividend is deemed approved, unless the 
IL DOI disapproves it within the 30 day notice period.  
Additionally, any dividend must be paid out of 
unassigned surplus excluding unrealized appreciation 
from investments, which for AIC totaled $11.04 billion 
as of December 31, 2017, and cannot result in capital 
and surplus being less than the minimum amount 
required by law.  

Under state insurance laws, insurance companies 

are required to maintain paid up capital of not less 
than the minimum capital requirement applicable to 
the types of insurance they are authorized to write.  
Insurance companies are also subject to risk-based 
capital (“RBC”) requirements adopted by state 
insurance regulators.  A company’s “authorized control 
level RBC” is calculated using various factors applied to

certain financial balances and activity.  Companies that 
do not maintain adjusted statutory capital and surplus 
at a level in excess of the company action level RBC, 
which is two times authorized control level RBC, are 
required to take specified actions.  Company action 
level RBC is significantly in excess of the minimum 
capital requirements.  Total adjusted statutory capital 
and surplus and authorized control level RBC of AIC 
were $17.70 billion and $2.80 billion, respectively, as of 
December 31, 2017.  Substantially all of the 
Corporation’s insurance subsidiaries are subsidiaries of 
and/or reinsure all of their business to AIC, including 
ALIC.  AIC’s subsidiaries are included as a component 
of AIC’s total statutory capital and surplus.

Note 17 Benefit Plans

Pension and other postretirement plans

Defined benefit pension plans cover most full-time 

employees, certain part-time employees and 
employee-agents.  Benefits under the pension plans 
are based upon the employee’s length of service, 
eligible annual compensation and, prior to January 1, 
2014, either a cash balance or final average pay 
formula.  A cash balance formula applies to all eligible 
employees hired after August 1, 2002.  Eligible 
employees hired before August 1, 2002 chose between 
the cash balance formula and the final average pay 
formula.  In July 2013, the Company amended its 
primary plans effective January 1, 2014 to introduce a 
new cash balance formula to replace the previous 
formulas (including the final average pay formula and 
the previous cash balance formula) under which eligible 
employees accrue benefits.

The Company also provides a medical coverage 

subsidy for eligible employees hired before January 1, 
2003, including their eligible dependents, when they 
retire and certain life insurance benefits for eligible 
retirees (“postretirement benefits”).  In July 2013, the 
Company amended the plan to eliminate the life 
insurance benefits effective January 1, 2014 for current 
eligible employees and effective January 1, 2016 for 
eligible retirees who retired after 1989.  In 2017, the 
Company continues to pay life insurance premiums for 
certain retiree plaintiffs subject to a court order 
requiring it to do so until such time as their lawsuit 
seeking to keep their life insurance benefits intact is 
resolved.  Qualified employees may become eligible for 
a medical subsidy if they retire in accordance with the 
terms of the applicable plans and are continuously 
insured under the Company’s group plans or other 
approved plans in accordance with the plan’s 

The amount of restricted net assets, as 

represented by the Corporation’s investment in its 
insurance subsidiaries, was $26 billion as of 
December 31, 2017.

Intercompany transactions

Notification and approval of intercompany lending 
activities is also required by the IL DOI for transactions 
that exceed a level that is based on a formula using 
statutory admitted assets and statutory surplus.

participation requirements.  The Company shares the 
cost of retiree medical benefits with non Medicare-
eligible retirees based on years of service, with the 
Company’s share being subject to a 5% limit on future 
annual medical cost inflation after retirement.  For 
Medicare-eligible retirees, the Company provides a 
fixed Company contribution based on years of service 
and other factors, which is not subject to adjustments 
for inflation.

The Company has reserved the right to modify or 

terminate its benefit plans at any time and for any 
reason.

Obligations and funded status

The Company calculates benefit obligations based 

upon generally accepted actuarial methodologies 
using the projected benefit obligation (“PBO”) for 
pension plans and the accumulated postretirement 
benefit obligation (“APBO”) for other postretirement 
plans.  The determination of pension costs and other 
postretirement obligations are determined using a 
December 31 measurement date.  The benefit 
obligations represent the actuarial present value of all 
benefits attributed to employee service rendered as of 
the measurement date.  The PBO is measured using 
the pension benefit formulas and assumptions as to 
future compensation levels.  A plan’s funded status is 
calculated as the difference between the benefit 
obligation and the fair value of plan assets.  The 
Company’s funding policy for the pension plans is to 
make contributions at a level in accordance with 
regulations under the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) 
and generally accepted actuarial principles.  The 
Company’s other postretirement benefit plans are not 
funded.

(1)  Components of the pension plan and other postretirement benefits were reduced by deferred income taxes at the newly 

enacted 21% U.S. corporate tax rate as of December 31, 2017 and 35% as of December 31, 2016. 

The $583 million decrease in the pension net 

actuarial loss during 2017 is primarily related to gains 
from favorable asset performance, a settlement loss 
and the amortization of unrecognized pension costs to 
net periodic pension cost, partially offset by a decrease 
in the discount rate and lump sum conversion rates.  
The majority of the $2.22 billion net actuarial pension 
benefit losses not yet recognized in 2017 reflects 
decreases in the discount rate.  The $33 million 
decrease in the OPEB net actuarial gain during 2017 
primarily related to amortization of net actuarial gains.

The primary qualified employee plan represents 

73% of the pension benefits’ underfunded status as of

The accumulated benefit obligation (“ABO”) for all 

defined benefit pension plans was $6.74 billion and 
$6.52 billion as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, 
respectively.  The ABO is the actuarial present value of 
all benefits attributed by the pension benefit formula 
to employee service rendered at the measurement 
date.  However, it differs from the PBO due to the 
exclusion of an assumption as to future compensation 
levels.

The PBO, ABO and fair value of plan assets for the 

Company’s pension plans with an ABO in excess of plan 
assets were $6.42 billion, $6.36 billion and $5.89 billion, 
respectively, as of December 31, 2017 and $6.24 billion, 
$6.18 billion and $5.30 billion, respectively, as of 
December 31, 2016.  Included in the accrued benefit 
cost of the pension benefits are certain unfunded non-
qualified plans with accrued benefit costs of $140 
million and $141 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively.

The service cost component is the actuarial 

present value of the benefits attributed by the plans’ 
benefit formula to services rendered by the employees 
during the period.  Interest cost is the increase in the 
PBO in the period due to the passage of time at the 
discount rate.  Interest cost fluctuates as the discount 
rate changes and is also impacted by the related 
change in the size of the PBO.  The decrease or 
increase in the PBO due to an increase or decrease in 
the discount rate is deferred and decreases or 
increases the net actuarial loss.  It is recorded in AOCI 
as unrecognized pension benefit cost and may be 
amortized.

The expected return on plan assets is determined 

as the product of the expected long-term rate of return 
on plan assets and the adjusted fair value of plan 
assets, referred to as the market-related value of plan 
assets.  To determine the market-related value, the fair 
value of plan assets is adjusted annually so that 
differences between changes in the fair value of equity 
securities and the expected long-term rate of return on 
these securities are recognized into the market-related 
value of plan assets over a five-year period.  We believe 
this is consistent with the long-term nature of pension 
obligations.

When the actual return on plan assets exceeds the 

expected return it reduces the net actuarial loss 
recorded in AOCI; when the expected return exceeds 
the actual return it increases the net actuarial loss.  
These amounts are recorded in AOCI as unrecognized 
pension benefit cost and may be amortized.  The 
market-related value adjustment represents the 
current difference between actual returns and 
expected returns on equity securities and hedge fund

limited partnerships recognized over a five-year period.  
The market-related value adjustment is a deferred net 
gain of $403 million as of December 31, 2017.  The 
expected return on plan assets fluctuates when the 
market-related value of plan assets changes and when 
the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets 
assumption changes.

Net actuarial loss fluctuations are due to changes 
in discount rate, differences between actual return on 
plan assets and expected long-term rate of return on 
plan assets, and differences between actual plan 
experience and other actuarial assumptions when 
there is an excess sufficient to qualify for amortization. 

Amortization of net actuarial loss in pension cost is 

recorded when the net actuarial loss excluding the 
unamortized market-related value adjustment exceeds 
10% of the greater of the PBO or the market-related 
value of plan assets.  The amount of amortization is 
equal to the excess divided by the average remaining 
service period for active employees for each plan, 
which approximates 10 years for Allstate’s largest plan.  
As a result, the effect of changes in the PBO due to 
changes in the discount rate and changes in the fair 
value of plan assets may be experienced in our net 
periodic pension cost in periods subsequent to those 
in which the fluctuations actually occur.  

Settlement losses are non-cash charges that 

accelerate the recognition of unrecognized pension 
benefit cost that would have been incurred in 
subsequent periods, when plan payments, primarily 
lump sums from qualified pension plans, exceed a 
threshold of service plus interest cost for the period. 
The value of lump sums paid in 2017 was higher than in 

2016 and exceeded the settlement charge threshold, in 
the primary employee plan, due to higher-than-
expected retirement levels, higher prescribed IRS lump 
sum interest rates that reduce future benefit lump sum 
payments and reductions in force. As a result, a

In general, the Company’s pension plan assets are 

managed in accordance with investment policies 
approved by pension investment committees.  The 
purpose of the policies is to ensure the plans’ long-
term ability to meet benefit obligations by prudently 
investing plan assets and Company contributions, 
while taking into consideration regulatory and legal 
requirements and current market conditions.  The 
investment policies are reviewed periodically and 
specify target plan asset allocation by asset category.  
In addition, the policies specify various asset allocation 
and other risk limits.  The target asset allocation takes 
the plans’ funding status into consideration, among 
other factors, including anticipated demographic 
changes or liquidity requirements that may affect the 
funding status such as the potential impact of lump 
sum settlements as well as existing or expected 
market conditions.  In general, the allocation has a

lower overall investment risk when a plan is in a 
stronger funded status position since there is less 
economic incentive to take risk to increase the 
expected returns on the plan assets.  As a result, the 
primary employee plan has a greater allocation to 
equity securities than the employee-agent plan.  The 
primary qualified employee plan comprises 81% of total 
plan assets and 86% of equity securities.  The pension 
plans’ asset exposure within each asset category is 
tracked against widely accepted established 
benchmarks for each asset class with limits on 
variation from the benchmark established in the 
investment policy.  Pension plan assets are regularly 
monitored for compliance with these limits and other 
risk limits specified in the investment policies.

(2)  The actual percentage of plan assets for equity securities include private equity investments that are subject to the limited 

partnership interests target allocation of 2% and 1% in 2017 and 2016, respectively, fixed income mutual funds that are subject to 
the fixed income securities target allocation of 3% for both 2017 and 2016 as well as 1% of equity exposure created through a

(3)  Securities lending collateral reinvestment of $202 million and $143 million is excluded from the table above in 2017 and 2016, 

respectively.

The target asset allocation for an asset category 

may be achieved either through direct investment 
holdings, through replication using derivative 
instruments (e.g., futures or swaps) or net of hedges 
using derivative instruments to reduce exposure to an 
asset category.  The net notional amount of derivatives 
used for replication and hedges is limited to 105% or 
115% of total plan assets depending on the plan.  
Market performance of the different asset categories 
may, from time to time, cause deviation from the target 

asset allocation.  The asset allocation mix is reviewed 
on a periodic basis and rebalanced to bring the 
allocation within the target ranges.

Outside the target asset allocation, the pension 
plans participate in a securities lending program to 
enhance returns.  As of December 31, 2017, U.S. 
government fixed income securities and U.S. equity 
securities are lent out and cash collateral is invested in 
short-term investments.

The expected long-term rate of return on plan 

assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected 
on plan assets.  The Company’s assumption for the 
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is 
reviewed annually giving consideration to appropriate 
financial data including, but not limited to, the plan 
asset allocation, forward-looking expected returns for 
the period over which benefits will be paid, historical 
returns on plan assets and other relevant market data.  
Given the long-term forward looking nature of this 
assumption, the actual returns in any one year do not 
immediately result in a change.  In giving consideration 
to the targeted plan asset allocation, the Company 
evaluated returns using the same sources it has used 
historically which include: historical average asset class 
returns from an independent nationally recognized 
vendor of this type of data blended together using the 
asset allocation policy weights for the Company’s 
pension plans; asset class return forecasts from a large 
global independent asset management firm that 
specializes in providing multi-asset class investment 
fund products which were blended together using the 
asset allocation policy weights; and expected portfolio 
returns from a proprietary simulation methodology of a 
widely recognized external investment consulting firm 
that performs asset allocation and actuarial services 
for corporate pension plan sponsors.  This same 
methodology has been applied on a consistent basis 
272

each year.  All of these were consistent with the 
Company’s weighted average long-term rate of return 
on plan assets assumption of 7.31% used for 2017 and 
7.32% that will be used for 2018.  The assumption for 
the primary qualified employee plan is 7.75% and the 
employee-agent plan is 5.75% for both years.  The 
employee-agent plan assumption is lower than the 
primary qualified employee plan assumption due to a 
lower investment allocation to equity securities and a 
higher allocation to fixed income securities.  As of the 
2017 measurement date, the arithmetic average of the 
annual actual return on plan assets for the most recent 
10 and 5 years was 6.8% and 9.9%, respectively.

Cash flows

There was no required cash contribution necessary 
to satisfy the minimum funding requirement under the 
Internal Revenue Code for the tax qualified pension 
plans as of December 31, 2017.  The Company currently 
plans to contribute $133 million to its pension plans in 
2018.

The Company contributed $23 million and $25 

million to the postretirement benefit plans in 2017 and 
2016, respectively.  Contributions by participants were 
$12 million and $16 million in 2017 and 2016, 
respectively.

Performance stock awards subsequently convert into

A total of 98.0 million shares of common stock 

were authorized to be used for awards under the plans, 
subject to adjustment in accordance with the plans’ 
terms.  As of December 31, 2017, 18.3 million shares 
were reserved and remained available for future 
issuance under these plans.  The Company uses its 
treasury shares for these issuances.

The fair value of each option grant is estimated on 

the date of grant using a binomial lattice model.  The 
Company uses historical data to estimate option 
exercise and employee termination within the valuation 
model.  In addition, separate groups of employees that 
have similar historical exercise behavior are considered 
separately for valuation purposes.  The expected term 
of options granted is derived from the output of the 
binominal lattice model and represents the period of 
time that options granted are expected to be 
outstanding.  The expected volatility of the price of the 
underlying shares is implied based on traded options 
and historical volatility of the Company’s common 
stock.  The expected dividends were based on the 
current dividend yield of the Company’s stock as of the 
date of the grant.  The risk-free rate for periods within 
the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. 
Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
The Allstate Corporation
Northbrook, Illinois 60062

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Financial Position of The Allstate Corporation and 
subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the related Consolidated Statements of Operations, 
Comprehensive Income, Shareholders’ Equity, and Cash Flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 
2017, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements").  We also have audited the Company’s 
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated 
Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission – (“COSO”).

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of 
the company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three 
years in the period ended December 31, 2017, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States 
of America.  Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial 
reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued 
by the COSO.

Basis for Opinions

The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over 
financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.  Our responsibility is 
to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting 
based on our audits.  We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United 
States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal 
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.  Those standards require that we plan and 

perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, 
whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material 
respects.  

Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the 

financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks.  Such procedures 
included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  Our audits 
also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating 
the overall presentation of the financial statements.  Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining 
an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing 
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.  Our audits also included 
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  We believe that our audits provide a 
reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the 
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles.  A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures 
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and 
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to 
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and 
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the 
company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or 
disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. 

Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become 
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may 
deteriorate.
