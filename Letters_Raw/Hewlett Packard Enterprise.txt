Dear Stockholders,

I am honored to write my first letter to you as CEO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise. As a 22-year Hewlett 
Packard veteran, I have a lot of pride in our company and people. I fundamentally believe HPE’s innovation 
will improve the world for our customers, partners, and employees.   

Transformation of HPE 

Our company’s strong position today was made possible by the work we did during the last several years. 
That work was led by my predecessor, Meg Whitman, who set up HPE for great success by strengthening 
our leadership team, reinvigorating our culture, and reigniting our innovation. During this time, we created 
tremendous shareholder value and put our long-term strategy in place. Without Meg’s vision and courage, 
HPE would not be where it is today—poised for a bright future.  

In 2017, we accelerated our progress by completing a number of strategic actions, including the spin-
mergers of our Enterprise Services business with CSC and our Software business with Micro Focus. These 
transactions created new industry-leading companies and delivered more than $20 billion of value to HPE. 
At the same time, we continued to strengthen our portfolio in key growth areas through acquisitions like 
these: 

 

 

 

 

• 

SGI, bolstering our industry-leading high-performance compute business

•  Nimble Storage, solidifying our leadership in all-flash storage

• 

SimpliVity, making us a leader in the fast growing hyper-converged market

•  Cloud Technology Partners, making us a global leader in cloud services  

Now, we have embarked on the next phase of our journey with a program we call HPE Next. This program 
will help us simplify the way we work, drive execution, and invest in innovation that will differentiate our 
solutions. Through HPE Next, we will create a purpose-built company for today and tomorrow’s competitive 
environment that will continue to lead in our markets for years to come. 

Our strategy and vision 

I believe HPE has the strongest portfolio in the industry today. We enable our customers to harvest, 
analyze, and store the critical data that improves customer experiences, drives new business models, and 
increases productivity. These capabilities are creating a new breed of data-driven enterprises. Our strategy 
is laser focused on enabling this enterprise transformation by helping our customers connect their data 
from the core, to the cloud, to the edge through three strategic pillars.   

First, as each customer embraces the unique mix of private and public cloud environments that best 
meet their needs, we are seeing an increasingly “hybrid” IT landscape—and we make Hybrid IT simple. 
We do that through offerings that help customers optimize their core IT environments with secure 
software-defined technologies that seamlessly integrate across traditional IT and multiple public and 

Hewlett Packard EnterpriseProxy Statement 2017 Annual Reportprivate clouds. Our solutions provide transparency and manageability for all of their applications and data, 
wherever they live.  

We continue to launch ground-breaking innovation in support of this vision. For example, in December we 
introduced Infosight, which is our new predictive AI technology across our storage portfolio, enabling the 
systems to predict and prevent problems before they happen. Leveraging advanced machine learning, this 
technology is an important step toward our vision for an autonomous data center.  

We also introduced OneSphere, a software management platform that lets customers deploy, operate, and 
optimize on-premises private cloud environments and public cloud capabilities through a simple, unified 
experience. I believe that no one else in the market can match the platform we have created.

The second pillar of our strategy is to power the Intelligent Edge. The “edge” is the world outside the 
data center. It is where enterprises interact with their customers, where employees congregate, and where 
companies manufacture their products. We are seeing a data-powered revolution happening at the edge as 
customers capture and analyze the unprecedented amount of data being created to drive their businesses.  

With Aruba, we have highly differentiated offerings in this area that allow customers to securely connect 
edge environments and drive new experiences and new revenue streams. Our Edgeline converged systems 
bring storage and compute directly to the source of the data that needs to be analyzed in a form factor 
optimized for the edge environments. And, our Universal IoT software platform seamlessly integrates data 
from disparate IoT systems at massive scale.  

These are all areas where we are well ahead of the market. And, the industry has taken notice. Late last 
year, Aruba was named a leader in Gartner’s Magic Quadrant for wired and wireless networking, and placed 
first for vision. That was the first time Cisco was displaced from this position.    

Third, services are more critical than ever. Increasingly, our business is driven by services expertise that 
helps customers navigate these incredible transformations, and our Pointnext services organization 
provides just that. We are also seeing growing interest in alternative consumption models that give 
customers financial flexibility through pay-per-use options. Our offering in this area, Flexible Capacity, is 
unique in the marketplace.

The time is now 

I am confident in our future. I truly believe we have built the best portfolio in the industry. We are a more 
focused and nimble company. And we have momentum. With all this in place, I believe we will continue to 
deliver significant shareholder value. 

It is such a great time to be a part of Hewlett Packard Enterprise. I could not be more proud and excited to 
lead this company.

Thank you for your continued support.

Best,

2018 PROXY STATEMENT

Patricia F. Russo
Chair of the Board

To our fellow Stockholders:

Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company
3000 Hanover Street
Palo Alto, CA 94304
www.hpe.com

This marks the end of an era and the beginning of the next for HPE. Nearly seven years ago, Meg Whitman
joined Hewlett-Packard Company with a bold, innovative turnaround plan designed to create a company with a
clear vision and the right assets through portfolio optimization and enterprise transformation. This fiscal year,
under the oversight of this Board of Directors, Meg led HPE through the culminating steps of that plan. Now,
HPE stands on the horizon of the next era with a crystal clear, long-term oriented strategy, an agile corporate
structure, a streamlined portfolio, and the challenge tested leadership of Antonio Neri. I am humbled to serve
as Board Chair through HPE’s transition from the era of transformation into our next chapter.

This journey has not been without its trying moments, but I can speak for every member of HPE’s Board of
Directors when I say that it has been exciting and fulfilling. We have deliberately and successfully established a
board that is optimally designed to deliver guidance tailored to HPE while maintaining a diversity of experience
and thought that is vital to our success. This Board is experienced. This Board is vigilant. This Board is
committed. Throughout this era of transformation, this Board has expanded its depth of oversight far beyond
traditional meetings and the traditional boardroom setting into active oversight, including one-on-one and small
group sessions with members of management, panel conversations at employee meetings, stockholder
engagement participation, continued education, and appearances at customer events. We have been and we
remain committed and excited to provide oversight and guidance to HPE’s management on the execution of
our strategy.

Sustainability and corporate citizenship are core values with Board level oversight at HPE and I want to take
this moment to note that, as HPE has undergone its era of transformation, society has faced an ever-changing
geopolitical landscape, a volatile economic framework, and an uncertain future. Now, more than ever,
corporations must adhere to sound corporate governance and maintain values that responsibly create
stockholder value. Our Board and our management team have maintained a best in class governance profile
and remain committed to applying the innovation engine of HPE to corporate governance and citizenship.

The annual meeting is a time for us to reflect on where we have been and where we are going. We are
pleased and excited to invite you to attend the third annual meeting of stockholders of HPE on Wednesday,
April 4, 2018 at 9:00 a.m., Pacific Time. This year’s annual meeting will again be a completely virtual meeting
of stockholders, conducted via live webcast. We are pleased to provide access to our proxy materials over the
Internet under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s ‘‘notice and access’’ rules. As a result, we are
mailing to many of our stockholders a notice of Internet availability instead of a paper copy of this proxy
statement and our 2017 Annual Report. The notice contains instructions on how to access those documents
over the Internet as well as how to receive a paper copy of our proxy materials. All stockholders who do not
receive a notice will receive a paper copy by mail unless they have previously requested delivery of proxy
materials electronically. Continuing to employ this distribution process will conserve natural resources and
reduce the costs of printing and distributing our proxy materials. Your vote is important to us and I do hope you
will vote as soon as possible.

In closing, I would like to convey sincere appreciation. First, to HPE’s employees: this company’s most
important capital truly is its human capital. On behalf of the entire Board of Directors, we recognize and
celebrate the dedication and ingenuity required to deliver this transformation. Second, to our customers, our
valued partners who are the reason driving everything we do. And finally, to you, our stockholders, we truly
appreciate your confidence and investment in HPE. As we accelerate into the next era, we are honored and
delighted that you have chosen to join us.

Sincerely,

20DEC201618424127

2018 PROXY STATEMENT

Proxy Statement Executive Summary

The following is a summary of proposals to be voted on at the annual meeting. This is only a summary, and it may not
contain all of the information that is important to you. For more complete information, please review the proxy statement
as well as our 2017 Annual Report, which includes our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
October 31, 2017. References to ‘‘Hewlett Packard Enterprise,’’ ‘‘HPE,’’ ‘‘the Company,’’ ‘‘we,’’ ‘‘us’’ or ‘‘our’’ refer to
Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company.

On November 1, 2015, HP Inc., formerly known as Hewlett-Packard Company (referred to in this proxy statement as
‘‘HP’’, ‘‘HPI’’, ‘‘HP Inc.’’, ‘‘HP Co.’’, ‘‘Parent’’, or ‘‘our former parent’’) spun-off Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company,
pursuant to a separation and distribution agreement. To effect the spin-off, HP Inc. distributed all of the shares of Hewlett
Packard Enterprise common stock owned by HP Inc. to its stockholders on November 1, 2015. Holders of HP Inc.
common stock received one share of Hewlett Packard Enterprise common stock for every share of HP Inc. stock held as
of the record date. As a result of the spin-off, we now operate as an independent, publicly-traded company.

STOCKHOLDER OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT
We maintain a dynamic, robust, and multi-faceted stockholder outreach program designed to provide
continuous and meaningful stockholder engagement and participation across our broad base of stockholders,
throughout the entire year. Rather than focusing on short term results, We maintain the goal of fostering strong
stockholder relationships leading to mutual understanding of issues and approaches, ultimately giving the
company insight into stockholder support as it designs and implements strategies for long-term growth.

The key elements of our stockholder outreach program are (i) the Securities Analyst Meeting, (ii) the Board
Outreach Program, and (iii) the Annual Stockholders Meeting. Our comprehensive stockholder engagement
program is supplemented by our year-round investor relations outreach program that includes post-earnings
communications, roadshows, bus tours, one-on-one conferences, group meetings, technology webcasts, and
general availability to respond to investor inquiries. The multi-faceted nature of this program allows us to

Corporate Governance (continued)

2018 PROXY STATEMENT

maintain meaningful engagement with a broad audience including large institutional investors, smaller to
mid-size institutions, pension funds, advisory firms, and individual investors.

We recognize that stockholders are the owners of the company and remain committed to stockholder outreach
programs that are truly a dialogue. We use every element of the outreach program to provide stockholders with
honest, candid information on relevant issues, sharing the rationale for our corporate strategy and the impact of
the Board’s oversight in key areas of the company, gathering stockholder views and feedback on each area, as
well as on the outreach program itself.

Securities Analyst Meeting
We lauch our stockholder outreach program in the fall with our annual Securities Analyst Meeting (SAM). At
SAM, our leadership team provides an update on strategy and the financial outlook, including detailed
information for each business unit, for the upcoming fiscal year. Although the event itself is geared toward the
analyst community, a primary purpose of SAM is to give stockholders direct insight into our business, strategy,
and outlook, providing those who plan to participate in the off-season engagement an informed basis to
formulate their views and questions. Accordingly, the entire event is publicly broadcast live, with the recorded
videos and transcripts also available on our investor relations website following the event.

Board Outreach Program
On the heels of SAM comes a cornerstone of our stockholder outreach—our innovative Board Outreach
Program. The program consists of focused, one-on-one meetings between stockholders and our directors over
a three-month period that are designed to give institutional stockholders an opportunity to better understand the
companies in which they invest. These meetings enable our stockholders to better fulfil their fiduciary duties
toward their investors and voice any concerns they have about HPE to our directors. This season, we extended
our extensive board outreach efforts to holders of nearly 47% of our stock, with holders of more than 42% of
our stock electing to participate.

We maintain clear structural goals for these meetings:

Provide direct stockholder access to the Board.

We believe it is important for stockholders to hear directly from our Board, just as it is important for directors
to hear stockholder’s concerns and perspectives unfiltered. Directors participating in the meetings include the
Board Chair, committee chairs, as well as other directors with whom stockholders may have a particular
interest in meeting. A limited number of members of management are also present, for the primary purpose
of facilitating the meetings as well as being available to answer more technical questions that may arise.

Achieve meaningful benefits.

In order to maximize the benefit of the engagement to both the investor and the company, we take the time
to conduct extensive research to understand each institutional stockholder’s voting policies and patterns,
salient issues and other areas of concern, and goals of engagement. Similarly, we understand institutional
governance teams work under time and resource constraints, and by inviting participants well in advance of
the meeting, and providing detailed updates of the company’s strategy and outlook during our Securities
Analysts Meeting and other investor and analyst events, we ensure stockholder participants will have
opportunity and information to prepare and engage in meaningful dialogue.

Comprehensive discussion.

We strive to ensure the stockholder meetings cover a comprehensive range of key topics including short-
and long-term strategy, capital allocation targets, governance and board oversight, Mergers and Acquisitions
activity, succession planning, and environmental and social concerns. Maintaining a disciplined approach to
the discussions, and allowing adequate meeting times, ensures matters important to stockholders are not
neglected in favor of addressing only current salient issues.

2017 Annual Meeting

Stockholder Question Composition

Virtual Stockholder Meeting
Our year-long stockholder outreach program culminates in our
annual stockholder meeting, which is conducted virtually through
a live webcast and online stockholder tools. We have created
and implemented the virtual annual meeting format in order to
facilitate stockholder attendance and participation by enabling
stockholders to participate fully, and equally, from any location
around the world, at no cost. We believe this is the right choice
for a company with a global footprint; not only bringing cost
savings to the company and stockholders, but also increasing
the ability to engage with all stockholders, regardless of size,
resources, or physical location. We remain very sensitive to
concerns regarding virtual meetings generally from investor
advisory groups and other stockholder rights advocates, who
have voiced concerns that virtual meetings may diminish
stockholder voice or reduce accountability. Accordingly, we have
designed this virtual format to enhance, rather than constrain,
Climate
stockholder access, participation and communication. For
Politics
example, the online format allows stockholders to communicate
2FEB201819255872
Other
with us in advance of, and during, the meeting so they can ask
any questions of our Board or management. During the live Q&A session of the meeting, we answer questions
as they come in and address those asked in advance, as time permits. We have committed to publishing and
answering each question received following the meeting. In 2017, this resulted in more than 200 stockholder
questions and comments communicated to, and answered by, our directors and management. Although the live
webcast is available only to stockholders at the time of the meeting, a replay of the meeting is made publicly
available on the company’s investor relations site. In additional to strong participation from individual
stockholders, we have continued to receive positive support from institutional stockholders who have indicated
the virtual format is beneficial and appropriate in the context of our broader direct outreach program.

CORPORATE CITIZENSHIP THROUGH LIVING PROGRESS
Sustainability and corporate citizenship are core values embedded in HPE at every level. To that end, we take
a thoughtful approach to our global citizenship efforts through our Living Progress program. This program is
overseen by the NGSR Committee which regularly reviews, assesses, reports and provides guidance to
management and the Board regarding HPE’s policies and programs relating to global citizenship and the
impact of HPE’s operations on employees, customers, suppliers, partners and communities worldwide. Our
commitment to corporate citizenship has been rewarded, earning us the distinction of Industry Mover in the
2017 Dow Jones Sustainability Index (‘‘DJSI’’). HPE holds the highest industry score globally in six DJSI
sections: Climate Strategy, Human Rights, Talent Attraction and Retention, Corporate Governance, Policy
Influence, and Privacy Protection. HPE also achieved the highest possible ranking from the Carbon Disclosure
Project for our carbon management and disclosure, ranking in the top 4% of companies evaluated. Detailed

2018 PROXY STATEMENT

Director Candidate Selection and Evaluation
Stockholder Recommendations
The policy of the NGSR Committee is to consider properly submitted stockholder recommendations of
candidates for membership on the Board as described below under ‘‘Identifying and Evaluating Candidates for
Directors.’’ In evaluating such recommendations, the NGSR Committee seeks to achieve a balance of
knowledge, experience and capability on the Board and to address the membership criteria set forth on
page 28 under ‘‘Proposals to be Voted on—Proposal No. 1 Election of Directors—Director Nominee Experience
and Qualifications.’’ Any stockholder recommendations submitted for consideration by the NGSR Committee
should include verification of the stockholder status of the person submitting the recommendation and the
recommended candidate’s name and qualifications for Board membership and should be addressed to:

Corporate Secretary

Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company

3000 Hanover Street MS 1050

Palo Alto, California 94304
bod-hpe@hpe.com
Email: 

Stockholder Nominations
In addition, our Bylaws permit stockholders to nominate directors for consideration at an annual stockholder
meeting and, under certain circumstances, to include their nominees in the Hewlett Packard Enterprise proxy
statement. For a description of the process for nominating directors in accordance with our Bylaws, see
‘‘Questions and Answers—Stockholder Proposals, Director Nominations and Related Bylaw Provisions—How
may I recommend individuals to serve as directors and what are the deadlines for a director nomination?’’ on
page 92.

Identifying and Evaluating Candidates for Directors
The NGSR Committee, in consultation with the Chair, assesses the appropriate size of the Board, as well as
the alignment of director skills with company strategy, and whether any vacancies on the Board are expected
due to retirement or otherwise, or whether the Board would benefit from the addition of a director with a
specific skillset. The NGSR Committee also considers board refreshment in its annual evaluation of the Board.
We balance our respect for historical knowledge of our company with our regard for fresh perspectives by
considering director tenure on a case-by-case basis, rather than imposing arbitrary term limits.

The NGSR Committee uses a variety of methods for identifying and evaluating nominees for director.
Candidates may come to the attention of the NGSR Committee through current Board members, professional
search firms, stockholders or other persons. Identified candidates are evaluated at regular or special meetings
of the NGSR Committee and may be considered at any point during the year. As described above, the NGSR
Committee considers properly submitted stockholder recommendations of candidates for the Board to be
included in our proxy statement. Following verification of the stockholder status of individuals proposing
candidates, recommendations are considered collectively by the NGSR Committee at a regularly scheduled
meeting. If any materials are provided by a stockholder in connection with the nomination of a director
candidate, such materials are forwarded to the NGSR Committee. The NGSR Committee also reviews
materials provided by professional search firms and other parties in connection with a nominee who is not
proposed by a stockholder. In evaluating such nominations, the NGSR Committee seeks to achieve a balance
of knowledge, experience and capability on the Board that will enable the Board to effectively oversee the
business. The NGSR Committee evaluates nominees recommended by stockholders using the same criteria as
it uses to evaluate all other candidates.

Corporate Governance (continued)

2018 PROXY STATEMENT

We engage a professional search firm on an ongoing basis to identify and assist the NGSR Committee in
identifying, evaluating and conducting due diligence on potential director nominees. In each instance, the
NGSR Committee considers the totality of the circumstances of each individual candidate.

Board and Committee Meetings and Attendance
Our Board has regularly scheduled meetings and an annual meeting of stockholders each year, in addition to
special meetings scheduled as appropriate. During fiscal 2017, our Board held 13 meetings. In addition, our
five committees held a total of 32 meetings, with the Audit Committee meeting nine times, the HRC Committee
meeting five times, and the NGSR Committee meeting three times. Each of the five regularly scheduled Board
meetings held during fiscal 2017 included an executive session, consisting of only non-management directors,
and one included a private session consisting of only independent directors. The Board expects that its
members will rigorously prepare for, attend and participate in all Board and applicable Committee meetings and
each annual meeting of stockholders. When directors are unable to attend a meeting, it is our practice to
provide all meeting materials to the director, and the Chair or the relevant committee chair consults with and
apprises the director of the meeting’s subject matter. In addition to participation at Board and committee
meetings, our directors discharged their responsibilities throughout the year through frequent one-on-one
meetings and other communications with our Chair, our Chief Executive Officer (‘‘CEO’’) and other members of
senior management regarding matters of interest.

Each of our incumbent directors who was a director during fiscal 2017 attended at least 75% of the total
number of meetings of the Board of Directors and the total number of meetings held by all committees of the
Board of Directors on which each such director served, during the period for which each such director served.

Directors are also encouraged to attend our annual meeting of stockholders. Last year, each of our directors
was in attendance.

Board Leadership Structure
The Board is currently led by an independent director, Patricia F. Russo, Chair of the Board. Our Bylaws and
Corporate Governance Guidelines permit the roles of Chair of the Board and Chief Executive Officer to be filled
by the same or different individuals, although the Corporate Governance Guidelines express a preference for
the separation of the two roles. This flexibility allows the Board to determine whether the two roles should be
combined or separated based upon our needs and the Board’s assessment of its leadership from time to time.
The Board believes that our stockholders are best served at this time by having an independent director serve
as Chair of the Board. Our Board believes this leadership structure effectively allocates authority, responsibility,
and oversight between management and the independent members of our Board. It gives primary responsibility
for the operational leadership and strategic direction of the Company to our CEO, while the Chair facilitates our
Board’s independent oversight of management, promotes communication between senior management and our
Board about issues such as management development and succession planning, executive compensation, and
company performance, engages with stockholders, and leads our Board’s consideration of key governance
matters.

• presides at all meetings of the Board, including executive sessions of the

independent directors,

• oversees the planning of the annual Board calendar, schedules and sets the
agenda for meetings of the Board in consultation with the other directors, and
leads the discussion at such meetings,

The Chair

• chairs the annual meeting of stockholders,

• is available in appropriate circumstances to speak on behalf of the Board,

and

• performs such other functions and responsibilities as set forth in our

Corporate Governance Guidelines or as requested by the Board from time to
time.

Board Risk Oversight
Given today’s ever-changing economic, social, and political landscape, structured, conscientious risk
management is more important than ever for every public company. Our Board, with the assistance of its
committees as discussed below, reviews and oversees our enterprise risk management (‘‘ERM’’) program,
which is an enterprise-wide program designed to enable effective and efficient identification of, and
management visibility into, critical enterprise risks and to facilitate the incorporation of risk considerations into
decision making. The ERM program was established to clearly define risk management roles and
responsibilities, bring together senior management to discuss risk, promote visibility and constructive dialogue
around risk at the senior management and Board levels and facilitate appropriate risk response strategies.

Under the ERM program, management develops a holistic portfolio of our enterprise risks by facilitating
business and function risk assessments, performing targeted risk assessments and incorporating information
regarding specific categories of risk gathered from various internal Hewlett Packard Enterprise organizations.
Management then develops risk response plans for risks categorized as needing management focus and
response and monitors other identified risk focus areas. Management provides reports on the risk portfolio and
risk response efforts to senior management and to the Audit Committee.

Corporate Governance (continued)

2018 PROXY STATEMENT

The Board oversees management’s implementation of the ERM program, including reviewing our enterprise risk
portfolio and evaluating management’s approach to addressing identified risks. Various Board committees also
have responsibilities for oversight of risk management that supplement the ERM program. For example, the
HRC Committee considers the risks associated with our compensation policies and practices as discussed
below, the Finance and Investment Committee is responsible for overseeing financial risks, and the NGSR
Committee oversees risks associated with our governance structure and processes. This structure allows
specialized attention to and oversight over key risk areas by aligning our carefully crafted committees with risk
oversight in their individual areas of expertise. The Board is kept informed of its committees’ risk oversight and
related activities primarily through reports of the committee chairs to the full Board. In addition, the Audit
Committee escalates issues relating to risk oversight to the full Board as appropriate to keep the Board
appropriately informed of developments that could affect our risk profile or other aspects of our business. The
Board also considers specific risk topics in connection with strategic planning and other matters.

Compensation Risk Assessment
During fiscal 2017, we undertook an annual review of our material compensation processes, policies and
programs for all employees and determined that our compensation programs and practices are not reasonably
likely to have material adverse effect on Hewlett Packard Enterprise. In conducting this assessment, we
reviewed our compensation risk infrastructure, including our material plans, our risk control systems and
governance structure, the design and oversight of our compensation programs and the developments,
improvements and other changes made to those programs, and we presented a summary of the findings to the
HRC Committee. Overall, we believe that our programs contain an appropriate balance of fixed and variable
features and short- and long-term incentives, as well as complementary metrics and reasonable, performance-
based goals with linear payout curves under most plans. We believe that these factors, combined with effective
Board and management oversight, operate to mitigate risk and reduce the likelihood of employees engaging in
excessive risk-taking behavior with respect to the compensation-related aspects of their jobs.

Succession Planning
Among the HRC Committee’s responsibilities described in its charter is to oversee succession planning and
leadership development. On an ongoing basis, the Board reviews succession plans for the CEO and other
senior executive positions. These reviews occur with input from the CEO and EVP, Human Resources and the
Board also reviews succession plans in executive session, with no members of management present.
Succession reviews for key executive roles, including the CEO position, consist of an assessment of internal
candidates as well as the review of external talent as identified by an executive search firm employed by the
Board.

In its deliberations around CEO succession that led to the appointment of Antonio Neri, the Board identified
several critical experiences, leadership attributes and business performance criteria essential for a successful
CEO at Hewlett Packard Enterprise. The Board was assisted in the process by engaging a leading executive
assessment firm over the course of several months. In addition, a separate executive search firm provided
potential external candidates for consideration based on the success criteria articulated by the Board. These
criteria and the assessment of both internal and external candidates led to a unanimous determination by the
Board to promote an internal candidate, Antonio Neri into the role. The Board determined that Mr. Neri had the
deep technical depth, strong customer and partner relationships, trusted leadership attributes and track record
of superior business performance to execute and realize the strategic vision of HPE.

In fiscal 2017, with the spin-off and merger of our Enterprise Services and Software segments, we engaged in
two robust organization design and talent selection processes to staff both companies, through which
management reviewed selection recommendations below the senior leadership level, considering skill sets,
performance, potential and diversity. Where the organizational changes altered our pre-existing succession
plans, new successors were identified and relevant talent development plans were implemented.

2018 PROXY STATEMENT

Director Evaluations
Our Board maintains a regular and robust evaluation process designed to continually assess its effectiveness.
The Board annually conducts a formal evaluation of the Board, each committee, and individual directors. The
process involves the NGSR Committee, working with the Board Chair, designing each year’s evaluation
process, selecting from a variety of elements including external evaluators, written evaluations, and group
discussions, based on the current dynamics of the Board and of the Company as well as the method of
previous annual evaluations. This year, evaluations were completed through individual interviews conducted by
the Board Chair, and were intended to gauge effectiveness in board composition and conduct, meeting
structure, materials, committee composition and effectiveness; strategic and succession planning; culture and
exercise of oversight as well as continued education and access to management.

Limits on Director Service on Other Public Company Boards
We have a highly effective and engaged Board, and we believe that our directors’ outside directorships enable
them to contribute valuable knowledge and experience to the HPE Board. Nonetheless, the Board is sensitive
to the external obligations of its directors and the potential for overboarding to compromise the ability of these
directors to effectively serve on the Board. HPE’s Corporate Governance Guidelines limit each director’s
service on other boards of public companies to a number that permits them, given their individual
circumstances, to perform responsibly all director duties and, in all events, this service may not exceed four
other public company boards. Further, the ability of each director to devote sufficient time and attention to
director duties is expressly considered as part of the annual board self-evaluation process, which aims to
evaluate the effectiveness and engagement of HPE’s directors, including in the context of their external
commitments.

While the Board considers its directors’ outside directorships during this evaluation process, the Board
recognizes that this is one of many outside obligations which could potentially impair a director’s capacity to
dedicate sufficient time and focus to their service on the HPE Board. As such, the Board evaluates many
factors when assessing the effectiveness and active involvement of each director. Such other factors include:

 The director’s attendance at Board and committee meetings.

 The director’s participation and level of engagement during these meetings.

 The role played by the director on the Board of HPE, as well as on his or her outside boards,

including committee membership and chairmanship.

 The experience and expertise of the director, including both relevant industry experience and service

on other (related) public company boards, which enables the director to serve on multiple boards
effectively.

We schedule our board and committee meetings up to two years in advance, to ensure director availability and
maximum participation. Directors serve for one-year terms; accordingly, there is an opportunity to evaluate
annually each director’s ability to serve.

Director Independence
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that a substantial majority of the Board will consist of
independent directors and that the Board can include no more than three directors who are not independent
directors. These standards are available on our website at 
director independence standards generally reflect the NYSE corporate governance listing standards. In addition,
each member of the Audit Committee and the HRC Committee meets the heightened independence standards
required for such committee members under the applicable listing standards.

(1) The director is, or has been within the last three years, an employee of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, or

an immediate family member of the director is, or has been within the last three years, an executive
officer of Hewlett Packard Enterprise.

(2) The director has been employed as an executive officer of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, its subsidiaries

or affiliates within the last five years.

(3) The director has received, or has an immediate family member who has received, during any 12-month

period within the last three years, more than $120,000 in direct compensation from Hewlett Packard
Enterprise, other than compensation for Board service, compensation received by a director’s immediate
family member for service as a non-executive employee of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, or pension or
other forms of deferred compensation for prior service with Hewlett Packard Enterprise that is not
contingent on continued service.

(4)

(A) The director or an immediate family member is a current partner of the firm that is our internal or
external auditor; (B) the director is a current employee of such a firm; (C) the director has an immediate
family member who is a current employee of such a firm and who participates in the firm’s audit,
assurance or tax compliance (but not tax planning) practice; or (D) the director or an immediate family
member was within the last three years (but is no longer) a partner or employee of such a firm and
personally worked on our audit within that time.

(5) The director or an immediate family member is, or has been in the past three years, employed as an

executive officer of another company where any of our present executive officers at the same time
serves or has served on that company’s compensation committee.

(6) The director is a current employee, or an immediate family member is a current executive officer, of a

company that has made payments to, or received payments from, Hewlett Packard Enterprise for
property or services in an amount which, in any of the last three fiscal years, exceeds the greater of
$1 million or 2% of such other company’s consolidated gross revenues.

(7) The director is affiliated with a charitable organization that receives significant contributions from Hewlett

Packard Enterprise.

(8) The director has a personal services contract with Hewlett Packard Enterprise or an executive officer of

For these purposes, an ‘‘immediate family member’’ includes a director’s spouse, parents, step-parents,
children, step-children, siblings, mother-in-law, father-in-law, sons-in-law, daughters-in-law, brothers-in-law,
sisters-in-law, and any person (other than tenants or employees) who shares the director’s home.

In determining independence, the Board reviews whether directors have any material relationship with Hewlett
Packard Enterprise. An independent director must not have any material relationship with Hewlett Packard
Enterprise, either directly or as a partner, stockholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with
Hewlett Packard Enterprise, nor any relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment
in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. In assessing the materiality of a director’s relationship to
Hewlett Packard Enterprise, the Board considers all relevant facts and circumstances, including consideration
of the issues from the director’s standpoint and from the perspective of the persons or organizations with which
the director has an affiliation, and is guided by the standards set forth above.

business with HP Inc. or Hewlett Packard Enterprise at some time during the past three fiscal years.
These business relationships were as a supplier or purchaser of goods or services in the ordinary course
of business.

As a result of this review, the Board has determined the transactions and relationships described above would
not interfere with the director’s exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a
director. The Board has also determined that, with the exception of Mr. Lane, Ms. Livermore, and
Ms. Whitman, each non-employee director during fiscal 2017, including Mr. Ammann, Mr. Andreessen,

with respect to current directors, has, no material relationship with Hewlett Packard Enterprise (either directly or
as a partner, stockholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with Hewlett Packard Enterprise)
and is independent within the meaning of both our and NYSE director independence standards. The Board has
determined that (i) Mr. Lane is independent within the meaning of NYSE director independence standards and
will be considered independent within the meaning of our more stringent director independence standards as of
April 4, 2018, (ii) Ms. Livermore is not independent under either standard because she was an employee of
Hewlett Packard Enterprise through October 31, 2016 and was an executive officer of our former parent within
the last five fiscal years, (iii) Mr. Neri is not independent under either standard because of his status as our
current President and CEO, and (iv) Ms. Whitman is not independent because she was an executive officer of
Hewlett Packard Enterprise through February 1, 2018.

2018 PROXY STATEMENT

Director Compensation and Stock Ownership Guidelines
Non-employee director compensation is determined by the independent members of our Board, acting on the
recommendation of the HRC Committee. On an annual basis when determining compensation, the HRC
Committee considers market data for our peer group, which is the same peer group used for HPE’s executive
compensation benchmarking (see ‘‘Fiscal 2017 Peer Companies’’ in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis
section) and input from Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc. (‘‘FW Cook’’), the third-party compensation consultant
retained by the HRC Committee regarding market practices for director compensation. Directors who are
employees of the Company or its affiliates do not receive separate compensation for their board activities.

The HRC Committee intends to set director compensation levels at or near the market median relative to
directors at companies of comparable size, industry, and scope of operations in order to ensure directors are
paid competitively for their time commitment and responsibilities. Providing a competitive compensation
package is important because it enables us to attract and retain highly qualified directors who are critical to our
long-term success. As noted above, during fiscal 2017, FW Cook conducted a review of director compensation
levels relative to our peer group. Results of their review indicated that, as a result of an increase to the median
total director compensation relative to last year’s study, the value of HPE’s then-current program was below our
peer-group median. To continue to align with HPE’s practice of setting director compensation levels at or near
the market median, the HRC Committee recommended, and the full Board approved, an annual increase of
$40,000 delivered in the form of an increased annual equity retainer. The HRC Committee intends to continue
to conduct director compensation reviews annually.

During fiscal 2017, non-employee directors were compensated for their service as shown in the chart below:

• Shares held by the director, directly or

indirectly, and deferred vested RSUs are
included in the stock ownership calculation
• Must be met within five years of election to

the Board

(1)

For purposes of determining director compensation, we use a compensation year that generally commences with the month in which
the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting is held, and ends one day prior to the following year’s Annual Stockholder Meeting date. However,
this does not coincide with our November through October fiscal year. Therefore, the pay components for the director compensation
program for fiscal 2017 reflect program guidelines during both the 2016 and 2017 board years. The 2016 board year began in March
2016 and ended March 2017. The 2017 board year began in March 2017 and will continue until April 2018.

(2) Annual cash retainer is paid in quarterly installments.
(3) Annual cash retainer and chairman or committee chair fees received in shares of HPE stock in lieu of cash, are delivered quarterly in

four equal grants. Meeting fees received in shares of HPE stock are delivered at the end of the board year.

(4) Deferral elections are made in December, and effective for the following calendar year. For calendar year 2017, directors were

permitted to elect to defer all or a portion of any compensation received in the form of RSUs or shares of HPE stock.

(5) RSUs generally vest on the earlier of the date of the Annual Stockholder Meeting in the following year, or after one year from the

date of grant. Directors receive dividend equivalent units with respect to RSUs.

(1) Cash amounts included in the table above represent the cash portion of the annual retainers, committee chair fees, lead independent
director fees, if applicable, chairman of the board fees, and additional meeting fees earned with respect to service during fiscal 2017.
See ‘‘Additional Information about Fees Earned or Paid in Cash in Fiscal 2017’’ below. Any amounts elected to be received as HPE
stock in lieu of cash are reflected in the Stock Awards column.
The amounts in this column reflect the grant date fair value of the annual equity retainer in the amount of $215,116, granted in the
form of RSUs in fiscal 2017, as well as the following compensation voluntarily elected to be received in shares of HPE stock in lieu of
cash during fiscal 2017: Ms. Russo received $133,293, Mr. Andreessen received $102,417, Mr. Brun received $9,997, Mr. Kleinfeld
received $34,707, Mr. Lane received $111,969, Mr. Reiner received $124,944, and Mr. Tan received $105,974 in shares of HPE
stock. The number of shares of HPE stock granted in lieu of cash is determined using the closing stock price on the last day of the
board quarter (rounded down to the nearest share). All or a portion of the stock awards may have been deferred based on the
director’s compensation election.

(3) Represents the grant date fair value of the annual equity retainer granted in fiscal 2017, calculated in accordance with applicable
accounting standards relating to share-based payment awards. For awards of RSUs, that amount is calculated by multiplying the
closing price of HPE’s stock on the date of grant by the number of units awarded. For information on the assumptions used to
calculate the value of the stock awards, refer to Note 7 to our ‘‘Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements’’ in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2017, as filed with the SEC on December 15, 2017. See ‘‘Additional
Information about Non-Employee Director Equity Awards’’ below.

(4) Mr. Kleinfeld forfeited his full unvested RSU equity retainer upon resignation from the Board effective April 24, 2017.
(5) Ms. Whitman served as CEO of HPE throughout fiscal 2017. Accordingly, she did not receive any compensation for her board

service. Please see the ‘‘Executive Compensation’’ section for details regarding Ms. Whitman’s fiscal 2017 compensation.

The dollar amounts shown include annual cash retainers earned during fiscal 2017. This includes amounts earned for the last four
months of the 2016 board compensation year, and the first eight months of the 2017 board compensation year. The amount reflected
for Mr. Kleinfeld is prorated due to his resignation from the Board effective April 24, 2017. Ms. Livermore became a non-employee
director effective November 1, 2016 (mid-third quarter of board year 2016), and therefore her quarterly cash retainer was prorated.

(2) Committee chair fees are calculated based on service during each board compensation year. The dollar amounts shown include such
fees earned in the last four months of the 2016 board compensation year, and the first eight months of the 2017 board compensation
year.

(3) Additional meeting fees are calculated based on the number of designated board meetings and committee meetings attended during

each board compensation year. The dollar amounts shown include additional meeting fees earned in fiscal 2017 for meetings
attended during the 2016 board compensation year. As of the end of fiscal 2017, no additional meeting fees for meetings attended
during the first eight months of the 2017 board compensation year had been earned.
Total excludes compensation voluntarily elected to be received in shares of HPE stock in lieu of cash during fiscal 2017 as described
in footnote three in the ‘‘Fiscal 2017 Director Compensation’’ table above.

Non-employee Director Stock Ownership Guidelines
Under our stock ownership guidelines, non-employee directors are required to accumulate, within five years of
their election to the Board, shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise stock equal in value to at least five times the
amount of their annual cash retainer. Service on the HP Co. Board of Directors immediately prior to the
separation of HPE from HP Co. on November 1, 2015, is recognized for purposes of such five-year period.
Shares counted toward these guidelines include any shares held by the director directly or indirectly, including
deferred vested awards.

All non-employee directors with more than five years of service have met our stock ownership guidelines and
all non-employee directors with less than five years of service have either met, or are on track to meet, our
stock ownership guidelines within the required time based on the trading price of HPE’s stock as of
October 31, 2017.

Corporate Governance (continued)
Anti-hedging/Pledging Policy
HPE has a policy prohibiting directors from engaging in any form of hedging transaction (derivatives, equity
swaps, forwards, etc.) in HPE stock, including, among other things, short sales and transactions involving
publicly traded options. In addition, with limited exceptions, HPE’s directors are prohibited from holding HPE
stock in margin accounts and from pledging HPE stock as collateral for loans. We believe that these policies
further align directors’ interests with those of our stockholders.

STOCK OWNERSHIP INFORMATION
Common Stock Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management
The following table sets forth information as of December 31, 2017 concerning beneficial ownership by:

• holders of more than 5% of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s outstanding shares of common stock;

• our directors and nominees;

• each of the named executive officers listed in the Summary Compensation Table on page 67; and

• all of our directors and executive officers as a group.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, requires our directors, executive officers and holders of more than 10% of
Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s stock to file reports with the SEC regarding their ownership and changes in
ownership of our securities. Based upon our examination of the copies of Forms 3, 4, and 5, and amendments
thereto furnished to us and the written representations of our directors, executive officers and 10%
stockholders, we believe that, during fiscal 2017, our directors, executive officers and 10% stockholders
complied with all Section 16(a) filing requirements.

RELATED PERSONS TRANSACTIONS POLICIES AND PROCEDURES
We have adopted a written policy for approval of transactions between us and our directors, director nominees,
executive officers, beneficial owners of more than five percent (5%) of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s stock, and
their respective immediate family members where the amount involved in the transaction exceeds or is
expected to exceed $120,000 in a single 12-month period and such ‘‘related persons’’ have or will have a
direct or indirect material interest (other than solely as a result of being a director or a less than ten percent
(10%) beneficial owner of another entity).

The policy provides that the NGSR Committee reviews certain transactions subject to the policy and decides
whether or not to approve or ratify those transactions. In doing so, the NGSR Committee determines whether
the transaction is in the best interests of Hewlett Packard Enterprise. In making that determination, the NGSR
Committee takes into account, among other factors it deems appropriate:

• the extent of the related person’s interest in the transaction;

• whether the transaction is on terms generally available to an unaffiliated third party under the same or

similar circumstances;

• the benefits to Hewlett Packard Enterprise;

• the impact or potential impact on a director’s independence in the event the related party is a director, an

immediate family member of a director or an entity in which a director is a partner, 10% stockholder or
executive officer;

2018 PROXY STATEMENT

• the availability of other sources for comparable products or services; and

• the terms of the transaction.

The NGSR Committee has delegated authority to the chair of the NGSR Committee to pre-approve or ratify
transactions where the aggregate amount involved is expected to be less than $1 million. A summary of any
new transactions pre-approved by the chair is provided to the full NGSR Committee for its review at each of
the NGSR Committee’s regularly scheduled meetings.

The NGSR Committee has adopted standing pre-approvals under the policy for limited transactions with related
persons.

Pre-approved transactions include:

1.

2.

3.

4.

compensation of executive officers that is excluded from reporting under SEC rules where the HRC
Committee approved (or recommended that the Board approve) such compensation;

director compensation;

transactions with another company with a value that does not exceed the greater of $1 million or 2% of
the other company’s annual revenues, where the related person has an interest only as an employee
(other than executive officer), director or beneficial holder of less than 10% of the other company’s
shares;

contributions to a charity in an amount that does not exceed $1 million or 2% of the charity’s annual
receipts, where the related person has an interest only as an employee (other than executive officer) or
director; and

5.

transactions where all stockholders receive proportional benefits.

A summary of new transactions covered by the standing pre-approvals described in paragraphs 3 and 4 above
is provided to the NGSR Committee for its review in connection with that committee’s regularly scheduled
meetings.

Fiscal 2017 Related Person Transactions
We enter into commercial transactions with many entities for which our executive officers or directors serve as
directors and/or executive officers in the ordinary course of our business. All of those transactions were
pre-approved transactions as defined above or were approved or ratified by the NGSR Committee or our
Former Parent’s NGSR Committee. Hewlett Packard Enterprise considers all pre-approved or ratified
transactions to have been at arm’s-length and does not believe that any of our executive officers or directors
had a material direct or indirect interest in any of such commercial transactions. In addition, during a portion of
fiscal 2017, Mr. Lane’s daughter, Kristi Rawlinson, served as a non-executive employee of Hewlett Packard
Enterprise. Prior to becoming an employee in 2013, Ms. Rawlinson previously served as a consultant to
ArcSight Inc. and, subsequently, HP Inc. (and thereafter HPE), following its acquisition of ArcSight. Following
the sale of HPE’s Software business to Micro Focus in September 2017, Ms. Rawlinson joined Micro Focus
and her employment with HPE terminated. The amount received by Ms. Rawlinson in her role at Hewlett
Packard Enterprise totaled approximately $142,284 in fiscal 2017.

Proposal

No. 1:

Election of Directors

On the recommendation of the NGSR Committee, the Board has nominated the 13 persons named below for
election as directors this year, each to serve for a one-year term or until the director’s successor is elected and
qualified.

DIRECTOR NOMINEE EXPERIENCE AND QUALIFICATIONS
The Board annually reviews the appropriate skills and characteristics required of directors in the context of the
current composition of the Board, our operating requirements, and the long-term interests of our stockholders.
The Board believes that its members should possess a variety of skills, professional experience and
backgrounds in order to effectively oversee our business. In addition, the Board believes that each director
should possess certain attributes, as reflected in the Board membership criteria described below.

Our Corporate Governance Guidelines contain the current Board membership criteria that apply to nominees
recommended for a position on the Board. Under those criteria, members of the Board should have the highest
professional and personal ethics and values, consistent with our long-standing values and standards. They
should have broad experience at the policy-making level in business, government, education, technology or
public service. They should be committed to enhancing stockholder value and should have sufficient time to
carry out their duties and to provide insight and practical wisdom based on experience. In addition, the NGSR
Committee takes into account a potential director’s ability to contribute to the diversity of background and
experience represented on the Board, and it reviews its effectiveness in balancing these considerations when
assessing the composition of the Board. Directors’ service on other boards of public companies should be
limited to a number that permits them, given their individual circumstances, to perform responsibly all director
duties. Each director must represent the interests of all of our stockholders. Although the Board uses these and
other criteria as appropriate to evaluate potential nominees, it has no stated minimum criteria for nominees.

The Board believes that all the nominees named below are highly qualified and have the skills and experience
required for effective service on the Board. The nominees’ individual biographies below contain information
about their experience, qualifications and skills that led the Board to nominate them.

All of the nominees have indicated to us that they will be available to serve as directors. In the event that any
nominee should become unavailable, the proxy holders, Antonio F. Neri, Timothy C. Stonesifer and Rishi
Varma, will vote for a nominee or nominees designated by the Board, or the Board may decrease the size of
the Board.

There are no family relationships among our executive officers and directors.

Proposal

No. 3:

Advisory Vote to Approve Executive

Compensation

Our Board and HRC Committee are committed to excellence in corporate governance and to executive
compensation programs that align the interests of our executives with those of our stockholders. To fulfill this
mission, we have a pay-for-performance philosophy that forms the foundation for all decisions regarding
compensation. Our compensation programs have been structured to balance near-term results with long-term
success, and enable us to attract, retain, focus, and reward our executive team for delivering stockholder value.
Below is a summary of key elements of our fiscal compensation programs relative to this philosophy.

PAY-FOR-PERFORMANCE

• The majority of compensation for executives is performance based and delivered in the form of equity, in

order to align management and stockholder interests

• Total direct compensation is generally targeted within a competitive range of the market median, with

differentiation by executive, as appropriate, based on individual factors such as tenure, criticality of the role
and proficiency in the role, sustained performance over time, and importance to our leadership succession
plans

• Actual realized total direct compensation is designed to fluctuate with, and be commensurate with, actual

annual and long-term performance, and changes in stockholder value over time

• Incentive awards are heavily dependent upon achievement of critical operating goals and our stock

performance, and are primarily measured against objective metrics that we believe link directly to the
creation of sustainable value for our stockholders

• We balance growth objectives, top and bottom line objectives, and short- and long-term objectives to
reward for overall performance that creates balance and does not overemphasize a singular focus

• A significant portion of our long-term incentives are delivered in the form of performance-based equity,

which measures internal and external metrics, ultimately aimed at driving stockholder value

• We validate our pay-for-performance relationship annually, through an analysis conducted for the HRC

Committee by its independent compensation consultant

STOCKHOLDER PROPOSAL

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE

AGAINST THE FOLLOWING STOCKHOLDER PROPOSAL

Proposal [4]—Right to Act by Written Consent

Resolved, Shareholders request that our board of directors undertake such steps as may be necessary to
permit written consent by shareholders entitled to cast the minimum number of votes that would be necessary
to authorize the action at a meeting at which all shareholders entitled to vote thereon were present and voting.
This written consent is to be consistent with applicable law and consistent with giving shareholders the fullest
power to act by written consent with applicable law. This includes shareholder ability to initiate any topic for
written consent consistent with applicable law.

Hundreds of major companies enable shareholder action by written consent. Taking action by written consent
in lieu of a meeting is a means shareholders can use to raise important matters outside the normal annual
meeting cycle.

Dozens of Fortune 500 companies provide for both shareholder rights—to act by written consent and to call a
special meeting. Our higher 25% threshold for shareholders to call a special meeting is one more reason that
we should have the right to act by written consent.

It is especially important to gain a shareholder right, such as written consent, to make up for our management
abruptly taking away an important shareholder right—the right to an in-person annual meeting. For decades
shareholders had a once-a-year opportunity to ask our $10 million CEO and directors questions in person. Now
our directors can casually flip their phones to mute during the annual shareholder meeting.

This includes Lip-Bu Tan, a distracted director (serving on 5 boards), who got 37% in negative voted and Marc
Andreessen who got 18% in negative votes. Plus the distracted Mr. Tan is one of only 2 directors on our
Nomination Committee.

Our management is now free to run a make-believe meeting with Investor Relations devising softball questions
in advance while tossing out other questions. Then our $10 million CEO can simply read the scripted IR
answers to a camera—no opportunity for audience feedback.

The lack of an in-person annual meeting means that a board meeting can be scheduled months after the
virtual meeting—by which time any serious issues successfully raised by shareholders under these onerous
conditions will be long forgotten by the directors. Plus a virtual meeting guarantees that there will be no media
coverage for the benefit of shareholders.

A virtual meeting is an evil disincentive plan for our directors and top management. Top management has no
incentive to avoid making mistakes for 365 days of the year out of concern that there will be an in-person
account at the annual meeting.

Please vote to give us a shareholder right to help make up for our top management stripping away one of our
important rights:

Proposals To Be Voted On (continued)

2018 PROXY STATEMENT

Board of Directors’ Statement in Opposition

The Board has carefully considered the proposal for stockholders to act by written consent without a meeting
(the ‘‘Proposal’’) and, for the reasons outlined below, the Board believes that it is not in the best interests of
HPE and its stockholders. Therefore, the Board unanimously recommends that stockholders vote ‘‘AGAINST’’
this Proposal.

Stockholder meetings offer important protections and advantages that are absent from the written
consent process under this Proposal

The Board is committed to robust corporate governance and believes in maintaining policies and practices that
serve the interests of all stockholders. The Board understands that corporate governance is not static—and
continually monitors trends and developments in corporate governance and compares and evaluates them
against our current practices. The Board recognizes that some stockholders may view the ability to act by
written consent as an important right. However, the Board believes that HPE’s existing Bylaw provision that
provides stockholders with the right to call special meetings offers a more transparent and equitable
mechanism for stockholders to raise matters for consideration by the Company.

HPE’s stockholders have the right to call a special meeting at a 25% threshold, which is the most common
threshold among S&P 500 companies that provide their stockholders with that right. This right to call a special
meeting, along with our established stockholder communication and engagement practices, provides
stockholders with opportunities to raise important matters and propose actions for stockholder consideration
outside the annual meeting process. The protections and advantages of stockholder meetings include:

• The meeting and the stockholder vote take place in a transparent manner on a specified date that is

publicly announced well in advance, giving all interested stockholders a chance to express their views and
cast their votes.

• The meeting provides stockholders with a forum for open discussion and consideration of the proposed

stockholder action.

• Accurate and complete information about the proposed stockholder action is widely distributed in a proxy
statement before the meeting, which promotes a well-informed discussion and consideration of the merits
of the proposed action.

• All communications with respect to the proposed stockholder action are governed by SEC rules that

require fair disclosure to all stockholders through amendments to a proxy statement and/or public releases
of all solicitation material.

• The Board is able to analyze and provide a recommendation with respect to actions proposed to be taken

at a stockholder meeting.

In contrast, the written consent process does not promote transparent decision making and could
disenfranchise stockholders

The Board recommends that stockholders vote against this Proposal because it believes the transparency and
fairness of the annual or special meeting process better serve stockholder’s interests. Proposing action by
written consent deprives stockholders of a forum for discussion or opportunity to have a meaningful and
structured exchange of views with the Board and other stockholders before acting. For example, in an attempt
at persuasion, the proponent of this Proposal has included several factually incorrect statements (such as the
number of directors on our Nominating, Governance and Social Responsibility Committee). Unlike written
consents, taking action at annual or special meetings allows for accurate and complete information about the
proposed stockholder action to be widely distributed, ensuring well-informed discussion and consideration of
the merits of the proposed action.

HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE

18NOV201618585199

Proposals To Be Voted On (continued)

2018 PROXY STATEMENT

Matters that are so important as to require stockholder approval should be communicated in advance so they
can be properly considered and voted upon by all stockholders. In contrast, this Proposal would allow holders
of a bare majority of shares to approve critical actions on their own, without notice to other stockholders or to
the Company and without an opportunity for discussion at a stockholder meeting. This Proposal, if adopted,
could therefore disenfranchise many stockholders and may deprive them of these rights, while enabling a small
group of stockholders (including special interest investors and those who accumulate a short-term voting
position through the borrowing of shares), with no fiduciary duties to the other stockholders, to approve their
own proposed actions. Accordingly, stockholder action by written consent could be used by a group of
stockholders—no matter how small of an ownership position they represent—to pursue individual agendas or
significant corporate actions that are not in the best interests of all stockholders.

Additionally, the written consent process has the potential to create confusion because multiple groups of
stockholders would be able to solicit written consents at any time and as frequently as they choose on a range
of issues, some of which may be duplicative or conflicting. Addressing such actions could impose significant
administrative and financial burdens on the Company with no corresponding benefit to stockholders. The Board
believes that these possible outcomes are contrary to principles of stockholder democracy, fair and accurate
disclosure, and good corporate governance.

HPE’s stockholder-friendly corporate governance practices empower stockholders and promote Board
accountability

The Board believes the Company’s existing strong corporate governance practices make adoption of this
Proposal unnecessary. In addition to the right of stockholders to call special meetings at a 25% threshold as
mentioned above, the following corporate governance provisions empower stockholders to express their views
or take action and enhance Board accountability:

• Annual Election of Board of Directors—All HPE directors are elected annually by the stockholders, and

stockholders can remove directors with or without cause.

• Majority Voting for Election of Board of Directors—HPE has adopted a majority voting standard for the

election of directors in uncontested elections.

• Proxy Access for Director Nominations—HPE has adopted a proxy access Bylaw provision that allows an

eligible stockholder or group of stockholders to nominate candidates for election to the Board that are
included in HPE’s proxy statement and ballot.

• Majority Voting for Charter and Bylaw Amendments—HPE’s charter and Bylaw provisions do not have

supermajority voting provisions—stockholders can approve binding charter and Bylaw amendments with a
majority vote.

• No Stockholder Rights Plan—HPE does not have a stockholder rights plan (also known as a ‘‘poison pill’’).

• Independent Board Leadership—HPE has separated the roles of Chair of the Board and CEO. The

Chairman of the Board is an independent director—as are all of the chairs of the committees of the Board.

• Stockholder Engagement—Stockholders can communicate directly with the Board and/or individual

directors. In addition, management and members of the Board regularly engage with stockholders to solicit
their views on important issues such as executive compensation and corporate governance.

Summary

The Board believes that the implementation of this Proposal is not in the best interests of stockholders or the
Company and is unnecessary, given the ability of stockholders to call special meetings and the Company’s

Executive Compensation
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Executive Summary

HPE is an industry-leading technology company. Our
technology and services help customers around the
world deliver business outcomes due to our deep
and comprehensive portfolio, spanning the cloud to
the data center to the intelligent edge. Our legacy
dates back to a partnership founded in 1939 by
William R. Hewlett and David Packard, and we strive
every day to uphold and enhance that legacy
through our dedication to providing innovative
technological solutions to our customers.

On November 1, 2015, HPE became an
independent, publicly traded company through a pro
rata stock distribution by HP Inc., formerly known as
HP. The separation has allowed HPE to focus on,
and more effectively pursue, our own distinct
operating priorities and strategies. This has led to
greater flexibility to invest capital in our own
businesses, a more simplified organizational
structure, enhanced efficiency in our operations, and
most importantly, improved focus on the unique
needs of our customers.

During fiscal 2017, we continued to execute our
long-term strategy to become a more nimble and
focused organization. On April 1, 2017, we
completed the separation and merger of our
Enterprise Services (‘‘ES’’) business with Computer
Sciences Corporation (‘‘CSC’’) to form DXC
Technology Company (‘‘DXC’’). Also, on
September 1, 2017, we completed the separation
and merger of our Software (‘‘SW’’) business
segment with Micro Focus International plc (‘‘Micro
Focus’’).

We made a number of strategic acquisitions in fiscal
2017 to strengthen our portfolio including, SimpliVity,
Silicon Graphics International Corp. (‘‘SGI’’), Nimble
Storage, Inc. (‘‘Nimble Storage’’), Niara, Inc.
(‘‘Niara’’), Cloud Cruiser, and Cloud Technology
Partners. We believe each of these additions are
highly complementary to our core business and
operate in high-growth markets with strong margins.
HPE also continues to invest organically in
introducing exciting new products, such as Synergy,
the industry’s first composable infrastructure, and
new service offerings, like our Flex Capacity.

During the third quarter of fiscal 2017, we launched
HPE Next, an initiative to improve our ability to
compete in the rapidly evolving technology industry.
Through this initiative, which is expected to be
implemented through fiscal 2020, we will simplify our
operating model, streamline our offerings and
business processes to improve our execution, and
more importantly, continue to shift our investments in
innovation toward high growth and higher margin
solutions and services. In addition to the reshaping
of our business portfolio, the HPE Next initiative is
expected to achieve annual run-rate net cost savings
of approximately $800 million exiting fiscal 2020.

On February 1, 2018, Ms. Whitman, retired as CEO,
and remains a director on HPE’s Board. Mr. Neri, a
22-year veteran of the Company, who most recently
served as the President of HPE and former
Executive Vice President of the Enterprise Group
business, is Ms. Whitman’s successor. Ms. Whitman
and the rest of the Board are confident that Mr. Neri
is the right leader to continue to execute HPE’s
strategy and deliver value for our stockholders due
to his deep understanding of technology, our
products and service offerings along with their
applications, as well as his experience, and his
passion for our customers, partners, employees, and
culture.

All of these efforts, initiatives, and changes help to
position HPE to successfully deliver on our vision
and the three key pillars of our strategy:

• Make Hybrid IT simple through secure, software-
defined offerings that enable customers to move
data seamlessly across their on-premises data
centers, private cloud, managed cloud, and
public cloud environments;

• Power the intelligent edge that runs campus,

branch, and Internet of Things (IoT) applications;
and

• Provide world-class expertise and flexible

consumption models to help customers
transform their IT environments.

Executive Compensation — Compensation Discussion and Analysis (continued)
Below is a summary of HPE’s financial and strategic highlights, as well as their corresponding impact to
compensation for fiscal 2017.

Summary of Fiscal 2017 Business Highlights(1)

Fiscal 2017 Compensation Impact

FINANCIAL
HIGHLIGHTS

• Net revenue of $28.9 billion, down 5% from the prior

year and up 1% when adjusted for divestitures and
currency.

• GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.21, above

the previously provided investor guidance of ($0.11) to
($0.07) per share, but below initial fiscal 2017 guidance.

• Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.41,

above the previously provided investor guidance of
$1.36 to $1.40 per share, but below initial fiscal 2017
guidance.

• Cash flow from operations of $0.9 billion, down from

$5.0 billion in the prior year driven by our spin-merge
transactions and lower net earnings.

• Returned $3.0 billion to stockholders in the form of

share repurchases and dividends.

• The calculated Annual Incentive achievement as a

percent of target for corporate NEOs, ranged between
54% and 76%, and between 44% and 100% for
Business Leader NEOs. However, due to the
underperformance of HPE’s overall financial
achievement, and to align with HPE’s pay-for
performance philosophy, the HR and Compensation
Committee of our Board of Directors (the ‘‘HRC
Committee’’) exercised its authority to apply negative
discretion and determined that no annual incentive
awards would be paid to the NEOs or other
Section 16 Officers for fiscal 2017 (see details in the
‘‘Fiscal 2017 PfR Program Annual Incentive Payout’’
table).

• Fiscal 2015 Performance-contingent Stock Options

(‘‘PCSOs’’), granted on December 10, 2014, were
forfeited because the associated stock price
performance goals were not met by December 10,
2017.

Portfolio Optimization

Long-term Incentive Program

STRATEGIC
HIGHLIGHTS

• Completed the ES/CSC spin-merge, creating DXC, a

pure-play, global IT service market leader; delivering
approximately $13.5 billion in value to HPE and our
stockholders, which included an equity stake in DXC
valued at approximately $9.5 billion, a $3.0 billion cash
dividend to HPE, and DXC’s assumption of certain HPE
debt and other liabilities.

• Completed the SW/Micro Focus spin-merge, creating

one of the world’s largest pure-play software
companies; delivering approximately $8.8 billion in
value to HPE and our stockholders, which included a
cash payment of $2.5 billion to HPE and an equity
stake in Micro Focus valued at approximately
$6.3 billion.

Targeted Acquisitions

• Hybrid IT

– SimpliVity - a leading provider of software-defined,

hyper-converged infrastructure

– SGI - a global leader in high performance solutions
for compute, data analytics and data management

– Nimble Storage - a provider of predictive all-flash

and hybrid-flash storage solutions

– Cloud Cruiser - a leading provider of cloud
consumption analytics software that enables
customers to manage and optimize public, private,
and hybrid cloud usage and spend

– Cloud Technology Partners - a leading advisory

company focused on cloud migration and cloud app
development

• Intelligent Edge

– Niara - a leader in the emerging User and Entity

Behavior Analytics (UEBA) security market segment

• We designed the fiscal 2017 LTI program to include
time-vested RSUs, and PCSOs with vesting tied to
achievement of specified stock price targets and
continued employment. We used this approach due to
the difficulty in forecasting multi-year financial
performance in light of the spin-merge transactions, as
well as the uncertainty that these portfolio restructuring
activities would have on our operating results.

• Following the completion of the portfolio restructuring

activities in fiscal 2017, and our ability to better forecast
multi-year financial performance, Performance-
adjusted Restricted Stock Units (‘‘PARSUs’’) have
been reintroduced for fiscal 2018. The fiscal 2018
PARSU design vests based on two- and three-year
performance periods, and measures Corporate Net
Income and relative Total Stockholder Return
(‘‘TSR’’) performance.

Annual Incentive Program

• We designed annual incentive goals to ensure that HPE
and ES/SW leadership teams were held accountable for
business performance prior to the closing of the
spin-merge transactions.

• To account for the impact of the SGI and Nimble

Storage acquisitions, annual incentive performance
goals were adjusted in a precise and formulaic manner
according to the pre-determined adjustment guidelines
set by the HRC Committee at the beginning of the
performance period.

Financial results, including the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation, are reflected as reported in HPE’s fourth quarter fiscal 2017
earnings press release.

2018 PROXY STATEMENT

Executive Compensation — Compensation Discussion and Analysis (continued)

Executive Compensation Pay-For-Performance Philosophy
Our executive compensation program, practices, and policies have been structured to reflect our commitment
to reward short- and long-term performance that aligns with, and drives, stockholder value. The tables below
summarize the key elements of the compensation programs applicable to our NEOs in fiscal 2017 relative to
HPE’s pay-for-performance philosophy.

PAY-FOR-PERFORMANCE

• The majority of compensation for executives is performance based and delivered in the form of equity, in order to align

management and stockholder interests

• Total direct compensation is generally targeted within a competitive range of the market median, with differentiation by executive, as

appropriate, based on individual factors such as tenure, criticality of the role and proficiency in the role, sustained performance over
time, and importance to our leadership succession plans

• Actual realized total direct compensation is designed to fluctuate with, and be commensurate with, actual annual and long-term

performance, and changes in stockholder value over time

• Incentive awards are heavily dependent upon achievement of critical operating goals and our stock performance, and are primarily

measured against objective metrics that we believe link directly to the creation of sustainable value for our stockholders

• We balance growth objectives, top and bottom line objectives, and short- and long-term objectives to reward for overall performance

that creates balance and does not overemphasize a singular focus

• A significant portion of our long-term incentives are delivered in the form of performance-based equity, which measures internal and

external metrics, ultimately aimed at driving stockholder value

• We validate our pay-for-performance relationship annually, through an analysis conducted for the HRC Committee by its independent

compensation consultant

In addition, the Company has adopted a number of policies and practices, listed below, to support its
compensation philosophy and drive performance that aligns executives’ and stockholders’ interests.

What We Do

What We Don’t Do

✘ Enter into individual executive compensation

agreements

✘ Provide tax gross-ups for executive perquisites
✘ Pay share-dividend equivalents in our long-term

incentive program before vesting of the underlying
shares occurs

✘ Provide supplemental defined benefit pension plans

(except in the case of international transfers)

Executive Compensation — Compensation Discussion and Analysis (continued)

Oversight and Authority Over Executive Compensation

ROLE OF THE HRC COMMITTEE AND
ITS ADVISORS
The HRC Committee oversees and provides
strategic direction to management regarding all
aspects of HPE’s pay program for senior executives.
It makes recommendations regarding the
compensation of the CEO to the independent
members of the Board for approval, and it reviews
and approves the compensation of the remaining
Section 16 Officers. Each HRC Committee member
is an independent non-employee director with
significant experience in executive compensation
matters. Our independent Chair of the Board also
attends most HRC Committee meetings in a
non-voting, advisory role. The HRC Committee
engages its own independent compensation
consultant as well as its own independent legal
counsel.

The HRC Committee continued to retain FW Cook
as its independent compensation consultant in fiscal
2017. The HRC Committee continued to retain
Dentons US LLP (‘‘Dentons’’) as its independent
legal counsel through July 2017, and then later,
upon the retirement of Dentons’ lead attorney, the
HRC Committee engaged Vedder Price, P.C.
(‘‘Vedder Price’’) as its independent legal counsel.

FW Cook provided analyses, market comparator
benchmarking, and recommendations that informed
the HRC Committee’s decisions. All modifications to
the compensation programs were assessed by FW
Cook on behalf of the HRC Committee, and were
discussed and approved by the HRC Committee.
Pursuant to SEC rules, the HRC Committee
assessed the independence of all its advisors, and
concluded each is independent and that no conflict
of interest exists that would prevent FW Cook,
Dentons, or Vedder Price from independently
providing service to the HRC Committee.

Neither FW Cook nor Vedder Price performs other
services for the Company, and neither will do so
without the prior consent of the HRC Committee
chair. Both Vedder Price and FW Cook meet with
the HRC Committee chair and the HRC Committee
outside the presence of management.

The HRC Committee met five times in fiscal 2017.
The HRC Committee’s independent advisors
participated in most of the meetings, as well as
preparatory meetings and executive sessions.

ROLE OF MANAGEMENT AND THE CEO
IN SETTING EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Management leads the development of our
compensation programs and considers market
competitiveness, business results, experience, and
individual performance in evaluating NEO and other
Section 16 Officer compensation. The Executive Vice
President of Human Resources and other members
of our human resources organization, together with
members of our finance and legal organizations,
work with the CEO to design and develop
compensation programs and implement the
decisions of the HRC Committee. Management also
recommends changes to existing plans and
programs applicable to NEOs and other senior
executives, as well as financial and other targets to
be achieved under those programs, and prepares
analyses of financial data, peer comparisons, and
other briefing materials to assist the HRC Committee
in making its decisions. During fiscal 2017,
management continued to engage Meridian
Compensation Partners, LLC (‘‘Meridian’’) as its
compensation consultant. Because Meridian is
engaged by management, the HRC Committee has
determined that they are not independent. This was
taken into consideration when any information or
analyses were provided by Meridian, all of which
were also reviewed by FW Cook on behalf of the
HRC Committee.

For fiscal 2017, Ms. Whitman provided input to the
HRC Committee regarding performance metrics and
the setting of appropriate Company-wide and
business-specific performance targets. Ms. Whitman
also recommended target qualitative goals
(Management by Objectives, or ‘‘MBOs’’) for the
NEOs and the other senior executives who reported
directly to her. Ms. Whitman was not involved in
deliberations regarding her own compensation. She
was subject to the same financial performance goals
as the executives who led global functions, and
Ms. Whitman’s MBOs and compensation were
approved by the independent members of the Board
upon the recommendation of the HRC Committee,
which was determined in executive session.

Process for Setting and Awarding Fiscal 2017 Executive Compensation

The Board and the HRC Committee regularly
explore ways to improve our executive compensation
program. Fiscal 2017 target compensation levels for
HPE executives were determined by the HRC
Committee. In making changes for fiscal 2017, the
HRC Committee considered the evolution of HPE’s
business and business needs, as well as appropriate
levels of compensation in comparison to HPE’s post
spin-merge peer companies. The objectives were to
encourage strong performance, pay commensurately
with performance, and align the interests of HPE’s
executives with those of HPE’s stockholders.

The HRC Committee and the Board considered a
broad range of facts and circumstances in setting

our overall executive compensation levels. Among
the factors considered for our executives generally,
and for the NEOs in particular, were market
competitiveness, internal equity, and individual
performance. The weight given to each factor may
differ from year to year, is not formulaic, and may
differ among individual NEOs in any given year. For
example, when we recruit externally, market
competitiveness, experience, and the circumstances
unique to a particular candidate may weigh more
heavily when determining compensation levels. In
contrast, when determining year-over-year
compensation for current NEOs, internal equity and
individual performance may weigh more heavily in
the analysis.

18NOV201618585199

2018 PROXY STATEMENT

Executive Compensation — Compensation Discussion and Analysis (continued)

Because such a large percentage of NEO pay is
performance based, the HRC Committee spent
significant time determining the appropriate metrics
and goals for HPE’s annual and long-term incentive
pay plans. In general, for fiscal 2017 compensation,
management made an initial recommendation of
goals, which were assessed by FW Cook, and then
were discussed and approved by the HRC
Committee. Major factors considered in setting goals
for each fiscal year include business results from the
most recently completed fiscal year, business-
specific strategic plans, macroeconomic factors,
competitive performance results and goals,
conditions or goals specific to a particular business,
and strategic initiatives.

In addition, the HRC Committee considered
feedback from our stockholders and the results of
our most current Say on Pay vote. Our fiscal 2016
Say on Pay vote reflected 83.3% support from our
stockholders. The HRC Committee believes this
indicates that our stockholders support the

philosophy, strategy, and objectives of our executive
compensation programs.

In setting incentive compensation for the NEOs, the
HRC Committee generally did not consider the effect
of past changes in stock price, expected payouts, or
earnings under other programs. In addition, incentive
compensation decisions were made without regard
to length of service or awards in prior years.

Following the close of fiscal 2017, the HRC
Committee reviewed actual financial results and
MBO performance against the goals under our
incentive compensation programs for the year.
Actual payouts were determined by reference to
performance against the established goals, and the
HRC Committee’s authority to exercise negative
discretion. In addition, the HRC Committee met in
executive session without members of management
present, to review the MBO results for Ms. Whitman,
which were then approved by the independent
members of the Board.

Determination of Fiscal 2017 Executive Compensation
FISCAL 2017 BASE SALARY
Consistent with a philosophy of linking pay to performance, our executives received a small percentage of their
target total direct compensation in the form of base salary. The NEOs are paid an amount of base salary
sufficient to attract qualified executive talent and maintain a stable management team. The HRC Committee
targeted executive base salaries to be at or near the market median for comparable positions at our peer
companies, and to generally comprise approximately 10% to 15% of the NEOs’ overall target total direct
compensation, which is consistent with the practice of peer-group companies.

For fiscal 2017, the Board maintained Ms. Whitman’s salary at $1.5 million, unchanged since fiscal 2014. As
part of HPE’s annual compensation-management process, Ms. Whitman recommended, and the HRC
Committee reviewed and approved, the following fiscal 2017 base salary increases to more closely align other
NEOs with similar executives of HPE peer companies. In addition, the HRC Committee approved a 10% salary
increase for Mr. Neri as a result of his promotion to President of HPE in June 2017.

FISCAL 2017 ANNUAL INCENTIVES
Pay-for-Results (‘‘PfR’’) Program Design

The NEOs are eligible to earn an annual incentive under our 2015 Stock Incentive Plan. The target annual
incentive awards for fiscal 2017 were set at 200% of salary for Ms. Whitman, and 125% of salary for the other
NEOs.

The performance metrics approved by the HRC Committee aligned with HPE’s intention to focus business
leaders more directly on the financial performance of their own business segments. The fiscal 2017 annual
incentive program consisted of three core financial metrics: net revenue, net/operating profit, free cash flow as
a percentage of revenue (‘‘FCF’’) and, as a fourth metric, individual MBOs. With the exception of NEOs aligned
with the Software business, each metric was weighted equally at 25% of the target award value. The applicable
net revenue, net profit, and FCF targets for business leaders relate to their respective business segments. For
others, those metrics relate to overall corporate performance.

Free cash flow payout is capped at 150% of
target if net profit is below target, and is capped
at 100% of target if net profit is below threshold

Revenue payout is capped at 100% of target;
to the extent both revenue and profit
performance are above target, the profit metric
becomes weighted 50%, and the revenue
metric becomes weighted 0%

2FEB201821300555

(1) Annual incentive design for Software was based on 25% revenue, 50% managed operating profit, and 25% MBOs

The specific metrics, their linkage to corporate or business results, as applicable, and the weighting that was
placed on each, were chosen because the HRC Committee believed:

• performance against these metrics enhances
value for stockholders, capturing both the top
and bottom line, as well as cash and capital
efficiency;

• requiring both revenue and profitability to be

above target in order to achieve an above-target
payout on these two measures encourages the
pursuit of profitable revenue;

• a linkage to business-segment results for

business leaders strengthens line of sight and
drives accountability;

• a balanced weighting and various caps limit the

likelihood of rewarding executives for taking
excessive risk;

• using different measures avoids paying for the

same performance twice; and

• individual MBOs enhance focus on business

objectives, such as operational objectives,
strategic initiatives, succession planning, and
talent development, which are important to the
long-term success of the Company.

GAAP or non-GAAP, may be further adjusted as permitted by those plans and approved by the HRC Committee. The HRC
Committee reviewed GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments and any other adjustments to ensure performance took into account the way
the goals were set and executive accountability for performance. These metrics and the related performance targets are relevant only
to HPE’s executive compensation program and should not be used or applied in other contexts.

(2)

Fiscal 2017 non-GAAP net earnings exclude after-tax costs related to the amortization of intangible assets, restructuring charges,
acquisition and other-related charges, separation costs, transformation costs, disaster charges, defined benefit plan settlement
charges and remeasurement benefit, an adjustment to loss from equity interests, tax indemnification adjustments and valuation
allowances, net and separation taxes. HPE’s management used non-GAAP net earnings to evaluate and forecast HPE’s performance
before gains, losses, or other charges that were considered by HPE’s management to be outside of HPE’s core business segment
operating results. We believe that presenting non-GAAP net earnings provides investors with greater visibility to the information used
by HPE’s management in its financial and operational decision making. We further believe that providing this additional non-GAAP
information helps management to evaluate and measure performance. This additional non-GAAP information is not intended to be
considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP net earnings.

In consideration of HPE’s continued business
transformation and the considerable impact of
foreign exchange rates, the HRC Committee
approved plan mechanics in the beginning of the
performance period to non-discretionarily revise any
internal financial goals for business transformation
transactions that have a material impact to HPE’s

revenue, and to limit foreign exchange impact on
actual performance results to no more than +/ⳮ 5%.
The HRC Committee continues to have negative
discretion to the extent it decides against revising
the performance goals, and can review and approve
adjustments below the initially set guidelines in
special cases.

Executive Compensation — Compensation Discussion and Analysis (continued)

Design Changes for Fiscal 2017

The terms of the fiscal 2017 annual incentive
program remained largely consistent with those of
the program from the prior year, but there were two
changes made to better align executives’ interests to
the interests of our stockholders:

• For business-segment level NEOs, the capital

management financial metric was changed from
‘‘HPE FCF as a percentage of revenue’’ to
‘‘Business FCF as a percentage of revenue,’’ to

Fiscal 2017 Financial Results

better hold the leaders of each business accountable
for their results.

• The profit metric for the leader of the Software
business segment was changed from ‘‘business
net profit’’ to ‘‘managed operating profit,’’ to
better hold the leader accountable for results
that they control and influence, including global
function allocations and the unallocated
corporate items directly managed by them.

Shortly after the completion of the fiscal year, the HRC Committee reviewed and determined performance
against the corporate financial metrics as follows:

were held accountable for business performance prior to the closing of the spin-merge transactions.

(2) Corporate targets are only disclosed after the end of the performance period. The Company does not disclose the targets pertaining
to its business segments because this information is not otherwise publicly disclosed by the Company, and the Company believes it
would cause competitive harm to do so in this proxy statement. Consistent with financial targets that are communicated to
stockholders, business-segment targets were set at levels necessary to drive stockholder value.

(3) Consistent with the HRC Committee’s guidance previously described, financial metric goals were revised due to the SGI and Nimble
Storage acquisitions, each of which were greater than the pre-determined threshold set at the beginning of the performance period.

(4) Consistent with the HRC Committee’s guidance previously described, corporate free cash flow results have been adjusted to reduce

the impact of foreign currency fluctuations based on pre-determined levels approved at the time the initial program performance goals
were set.

DETAILED DISCUSSION OF MBOs

With respect to performance against the MBOs, the
independent members of the Board evaluated
Ms. Whitman’s performance during an executive
session held shortly following the end of the fiscal
year. The evaluation included an analysis of
Ms. Whitman’s performance against all of her
individual MBOs, which included, but were not
limited to: ensuring the successful and timely closure
of both the ES/CSC and SW/Micro Focus
spin-merge transactions, delivering on HPE’s
strategy and improving growth and operating
margins for the remaining HPE portfolio, and
regaining revenue growth momentum by even

greater direct engagement with customers, partners,
and large scale service providers/integrators.

After conducting a thorough review of Ms. Whitman’s
performance, the independent members of the HPE
Board determined that Ms. Whitman’s MBO
performance had been achieved above target.
Ms. Whitman’s accomplishments included:

• successfully executing the ES/CSC and SW/Micro
Focus spin-merge transactions, in a timely manner
and under budget, while unlocking $13.5 billion
and $8.8 billion in stockholder value, respectively;

58

58

HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE

18NOV201618585199

2018 PROXY STATEMENT

Executive Compensation — Compensation Discussion and Analysis (continued)

• executing HPE’s business strategy by leading a

high level of M&A activity, including the
acquisitions of SimpliVity, SGI, Nimble Storage,
Niara, Cloud Cruiser, and Cloud Technology
Partners, most of which were performing at or
better than financially planned as of fiscal
year-end;

• generating significant business by resetting
HPE’s relationship with key customers, and
achieving a number of high profile sales wins;
and

• engineering HPE Next, a transformative set of

initiatives to optimize HPE’s current portfolio into
a higher performing business model that will
create improved stockholder returns over the
next three years and beyond.

As the former CEO, Ms. Whitman evaluated the
performance of other Section 16 Officers and
presented her recommendations based on those
evaluations to the HRC Committee shortly following
the end of the fiscal year. The evaluations included
an analysis of each officer’s performance against
their individual MBOs, which are intended to be
differentiated performance metrics. After discussion,
the HRC Committee determined the degree of
attainment of the MBOs. The results of these
evaluations and selected MBOs for the other NEOs
are summarized below:

Mr. Stonesifer. The HRC Committee determined
that Mr. Stonesifer’s MBO performance had been
achieved at target. HPE achieved earnings per share
in line with expectations at year-end, and also
delivered on its commitments of share repurchases
and dividends. Mr. Stonesifer’s oversight of complex
spin-merge agreements, acquisition integration, and
financial performance following the transactions were
noteworthy in ensuring HPE met or exceeded
investment plans.

Mr. Neri. The HRC Committee determined that
Mr. Neri’s MBO performance had been achieved
above target. While the Enterprise Group business
underperformed in a highly challenging year due to
intense pricing actions by scale competitors and
commodity inflation, Mr. Neri played a key role in
strengthening HPE’s portfolio though several
successful acquisitions, most of which performed at

or better than financially planned as of the end of
fiscal 2017. In addition, Mr. Neri’s performance
excelled as he pivoted from his prior role as
Executive Vice President of the Enterprise Group to
a more strategic role as President of HPE. He
successfully collaborated with Ms. Whitman and the
Board to craft the go-forward HPE strategy and
financial architecture and ultimately assumed
leadership of HPE Next, the primary planning and
operational vehicle for a highly transformative set of
strategic shifts in product positioning, go-to-market
focus, and business process improvements designed
to deliver the 2018-20 business plan.

Mr. Schultz. The HRC Committee determined that
Mr. Schultz’s MBO performance had been achieved
above target. He continues to be a leader among
corporate General Counsels and he drove a
significant increase in productivity across the Office
of the General Counsel. Through his intensive
personal effort and deep expertise, both highly
complex spin-merge transactions closed on time and
under budget. Mr. Schultz continued to excel, not
only in his traditional role as General Counsel, but
also as a driving force for a number of key strategic
HPE initiatives.

Mr. Gomez. The HRC Committee determined that
Mr. Gomez’s MBO performance had been achieved
above target. He delivered world class marketing
and communications support across the organization
in fiscal 2017, despite significant changes in the
product portfolio due to complex spin-merge activity,
six acquisitions, and considerable external market
headwinds. His leadership helped improve HPE
sales performance and maintain brand relevance. In
addition, Mr. Gomez made significant contributions to
the HPE Next initiative, including extensive and
complex communications efforts.

Mr. Hsu. The HRC Committee determined that
Mr. Hsu’s MBO performance had been achieved
above target. He successfully executed the on-time
and under-budget closure of both the ES/CSC and
SW/ Micro Focus spin-merge transactions,
generating significant stockholder value. Mr. Hsu
simultaneously drove a major turnaround in the
Software business, resulting in substantial operating
profit improvement year-over-year. Following the
closure of the Software spin-merge transaction,
Mr. Hsu transitioned to CEO of Micro Focus.

Executive Compensation — Compensation Discussion and Analysis (continued)

Based on the findings of these performance evaluations, the HRC Committee (and, in the case of
Ms. Whitman, the independent members of the Board) evaluated performance against the non-financial metrics
for the NEOs to determine the overall level of achievement in the table below. HPE does not disclose detailed

Based on the fiscal 2017 financial and non-financial level of performance described above, the calculated
annual incentive results for the NEOs under the PfR program ranged between 44% and 100% of target.
However, due to the underachievement of HPE’s financial performance overall, the HRC Committee (and the
independent members of the Board, in the case of Ms. Whitman) applied negative discretion and determined
that no annual incentive awards would be paid to the NEOs, or other Section 16 Officers for fiscal 2017. The
calculated annual incentive awards prior to the HRC Committee’s application of negative discretion are
reflected in the table below.

target annual incentive amounts have been prorated based on his 10 months of fiscal 2017 HPE employment.

(2)

Due to HPE’s financial achievement overall, and to align with HPE’s pay-for-performance philosophy, the HRC Committee exercised its authority to apply
negative discretion and did not approve any annual incentive payouts for fiscal 2017.

Within the first 90 days of fiscal 2017, the HRC
Committee established an ‘‘umbrella’’ pool under
which a maximum bonus was determined in order to
permit awards to be eligible to be considered
qualified performance-based compensation under

Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the ‘‘Code’’). Under the umbrella
formula, each Section 16 Officer was allocated a pro
rata share of 1.0% of net earnings based on his or
her target annual incentive award, subject to a

maximum bonus of 200% of each NEO’s target
bonus, and the maximum $10 million cap under the
PfR program. After certifying the size of the pool and
the individual allocations, which were each in excess
of the maximum potential bonus for the Covered
Officers, the HRC Committee determined actual
payouts through the exercise of negative discretion
based upon financial metrics and MBOs established
by the HRC Committee for Section 16 Officers and
by the independent members of the Board for
Ms. Whitman, as described above.

LONG-TERM INCENTIVES

Fiscal 2017 Award Mix

The HRC Committee established a streamlined LTI
design for our NEOs that consisted of two vehicles
in preparation for the ES/CSC and SW/Micro Focus
spin-merge transactions completed in fiscal 2017.
The equity award types and value-based mix were
considered appropriate for fiscal 2017 given the
difficulty in forecasting multi-year financial
performance in light of the spin-merge transactions.

The fiscal 2017 LTI award value-based vehicle mix
for the NEOs is shown in the following chart:

• PCSOs support stockholder alignment as these
options only create value for the recipient to the
extent that our stock achieves rigorous
pre-established stock price performance goals.
As a result, we believe performance-contingent
stock options encourage executives to focus on
driving stock price appreciation and stockholder
value. This grant vests ratably over three years
to the extent performance conditions are
achieved.

• RSUs support retention and are linked to

stockholder value and ownership, which are also
important goals of HPE’s executive
compensation program. This grant vests ratably
over three years from the date of grant.

Fiscal 2017 LTI Grant Values

The HRC Committee, and in the case of
Ms. Whitman, the independent members of the
Board, approved the value of fiscal 2017 annual LTI
awards for the NEOs based on factors such as:
competitive market data, internal equity, individual
performance, and the executives’ potential future
contributions.

the impact of one-time accounting costs resulting
from the conversion of equity awards following the
close of the ES/CSC spin-merge transaction.

For more information on NEO grants of PCSOs and
RSUs during fiscal 2017, see ‘‘Grants of Plan-Based
Awards in Fiscal 2017’’ table.

Fiscal 2017 PCSOs

The PCSOs were structured to have both ratable
time-based vesting requirements and performance
conditions in the form of pre-established stock price
performance goals. Each of the three vesting
tranches risk forfeiture unless the stock price
performance goals are met within two, four, and five
years respectively. In setting the stock price
performance goals required for the PCSOs to vest,
the HRC Committee considered not only the stock
price itself, but also the underlying compound annual
growth rate required both to achieve vesting in the
targeted three years, as well as to avoid forfeiture by
meeting stock price performance goals in later years.

The annual PCSOs were granted to the NEOs on
December 7, 2016, with a grant price of $14.67. As
of the end of fiscal 2017, each of the three stock
price performance goals were unmet.

spin-merge transactions based on the conversion ratio determined by dividing the close price immediately prior to each transaction by

Design Changes for Fiscal 2017

Management recommended, and the HRC Committee approved, certain changes to the equity vehicle
weighting for our fiscal 2017 grant. The fiscal 2017 annual equity awards were granted fifty percent in PCSOs
and fifty percent in RSUs to acknowledge the goal-setting challenges in fiscal 2017 due to the expected
spin-merge transactions and to further support stability and stockholder alignment. As noted previously, given
the difficulty in forecasting multi-year financial performance in light of the spin-merge transactions, this value-
based equity mix was considered appropriate for fiscal 2017. PARSUs have been reintroduced in fiscal 2018
which is further discussed in the ‘‘Fiscal 2018 Compensation Program’’ section.

BENEFITS
Our NEOs receive health and welfare benefits
(including retiree medical benefits if eligibility
conditions are met) under the same programs and
subject to the same eligibility requirements that apply
to our U.S. employees generally. We do not provide
our executives, including the NEOs, with special or
supplemental U.S. defined benefit pension or health
benefits.

The NEOs, along with other executives who earn
base pay or annual incentives in excess of certain
limits under the Code, were eligible in fiscal 2017 to
participate in the HPE Executive

Deferred Compensation Plan (the ‘‘EDCP’’). This
plan was maintained to permit executives to defer a
portion of their compensation and related taxation on
such amounts. This is a standard benefit plan also
offered by the majority of our peer-group companies,
and is more fully described in the ‘‘Narrative to the
Fiscal 2017 Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation
Table’’ section. Amounts deferred or matched under
the EDCP are credited with notional investment
earnings based on investment options selected by
the participant from among mutual and proprietary
funds available to employees under the HPE 401(k)
Plan. No amounts in EDCP earn above-market
returns.

Executive Compensation — Compensation Discussion and Analysis (continued)

PERQUISITES
Consistent with the practices of our peer-group
companies, we provide a limited number of
perquisites to our senior executives, including the
NEOs, as discussed below.

We provide our NEOs with financial counseling
services to assist them in obtaining professional
financial advice, which is a common benefit among
our peer-group companies. This helps increase the
understanding and effectiveness of our executive
compensation program, and also increase
productivity by limiting distractions from Company
responsibilities to attend to personal financial
matters. The value of these services is taxable to
our executives.

The CEO may use company aircraft for personal
purposes in their own discretion and, at times, is

advised to use company aircraft for personal travel
for security reasons. The other NEOs may use
company aircraft for personal purposes under certain
limited circumstances, if available and approved in
advance by the CEO. The NEOs, including the CEO,
are taxed on the value of this personal usage
according to applicable tax rules. There is no tax
gross-up paid on the income attributable to this
value. In fiscal 2012, Ms. Whitman entered into a
‘‘time-sharing’’ agreement, which was renewed each
year since and, under which she reimbursed the
Company for costs incurred in connection with
certain personal travel on corporate aircraft above a
certain amount in a given fiscal year.

For details on perquisites received during fiscal
2017, see the ‘‘Summary Compensation Table’’
below.

Other Compensation-Related Matters
USE OF COMPARATIVE COMPENSATION DATA AND COMPENSATION PHILOSOPHY
The HRC Committee reviewed Section 16 Officer compensation and compared it to that of executives in similar
positions with HPE’s peer-group companies for purposes of benchmarking target pay levels. In light of the
significance of the Enterprise Services business spin-merge transaction, the HRC Committee asked FW Cook
to conduct a review of, and propose potential changes to, HPE’s peer group to reflect its smaller size and
scope of operations. As a result of that review, seven large companies were removed (Amazon, Apple,
Caterpillar, General Electric, Google, Microsoft and United Technologies), and six companies were added
(Cognizant, HP Inc., Micron Technology, Seagate Technology, Texas Instruments and Western Digital). The
HRC Committee reviewed and approved the following peer group, which informed decision making for fiscal
2017 target pay levels:

Technology

Fiscal 2017 Peer Companies

• Accenture
• ADP
• Cisco Systems, Inc.
• Cognizant
• Computer Sciences Corporation
• EMC Corporation
• HP Inc.
• IBM

• Intel Corporation
• Micron Technology
• Oracle Corporation
• Qualcomm
• Seagate Technology
• Texas Instruments
• Xerox
• Western Digital

• The Boeing Company

Non-technology

• Honeywell

For fiscal 2017, FW Cook used the following
screening criteria to develop a pool of potential
peers:

• Industry—companies operating in similar or

comparable industry space

• Size—companies within a range of 1/3rd to three

times HPE’s projected post-spin revenue and
1/5th to five times HPE’s projected post-spin
market capitalization

18NOV201618585199

2018 PROXY STATEMENT

Executive Compensation — Compensation Discussion and Analysis (continued)

HPE is positioned in a reasonable range around
peer median on several size characteristics
(e.g., revenue, operating income, and total assets).
The Company was around the 60th percentile for
revenue and around the 30th percentile for market
capitalization, despite the removal of several large
companies from its prior peer group. FW Cook’s
industry- and size-based analysis did not identify
additional suitable peers that would leave positioning
on other important size elements at appropriate
levels, while materially changing HPE’s relative
positioning on market capitalization.

In reviewing comparative pay data from these
companies against pay for our Section 16 Officers,
the HRC Committee evaluated data, using
regression analysis where necessary, to adjust for
size differences between HPE and the peer-group
companies. Exclusions were made for particular data
points of certain companies if they were anomalous
and not representative of market practices. The HRC
Committee continued to set target total direct
compensation levels for fiscal 2017 that were
generally at or near the market median, although in
some cases higher for attraction and retention
purposes.

The HRC Committee has and will continue to review
HPE’s peer group annually to assess the
appropriateness for competitive benchmarking of
executive pay and compensation design.

EXECUTIVE STOCK OWNERSHIP
GUIDELINES
HPE has stock ownership guidelines designed to
align executives’ interests more closely with those of
stockholders, and mitigate the potential for taking
excessive risk that could affect the value of HPE
stock. Under the guidelines, within five years of
assuming a designated position, the CEO should
attain and hold an investment position in our stock
equal to seven times their base salary, and all other
Section 16 EVPs should attain and hold an
investment position equal to five times their
respective base salaries. Shares counted toward
these guidelines include any shares held by the
executive directly or through a broker, shares held
through the HPE 401(k) Plan, shares held as
restricted stock, shares underlying time-vested
RSUs, and shares underlying vested but unexercised
stock options (fifty percent of the in-the-money value
of such options is used for this calculation). All

NEOs held the required investment position in HPE’s
stock as of the end of fiscal 2017.

ANTI-HEDGING/PLEDGING POLICY
We have a policy prohibiting HPE’s executive
officers from engaging in any form of hedging
transaction (derivatives, equity swaps, forwards, etc.)
in HPE stock, including, among other things, short
sales and transactions involving publicly traded
options. In addition, with limited exceptions, HPE’s
executive officers are prohibited from holding HPE
stock in margin accounts and from pledging HPE
stock as collateral for loans. We believe that these
policies further align executives’ interests with those
of our stockholders.

POLICY ON RECOVERY IN EVENT OF
FINANCIAL RESTATEMENT
HPE has adopted a ‘‘clawback’’ policy that permits
the Company to recover certain annual and
long-term incentives from senior executives whose
fraud or misconduct resulted in a significant
restatement of financial results. The policy allows for
the recovery of incentives paid at or above target
from those senior executives whose fraud or
misconduct resulted in the restatement where the
incentives would have been lower absent the fraud
or misconduct, as determined by the Board. In
addition, HPE’s equity grant agreements clarify that
awards are subject to the clawback policy.

FISCAL 2018 COMPENSATION
PROGRAM
With HPE successfully completing its primary
portfolio restructuring activities in fiscal 2017, and
therefore, its improving ability to better forecast
multi-year financial performance, the HRC
Committee approved a fiscal 2018 compensation
structure that aligns more closely with market best
practice and continues to support stockholder
interests.

• The long-term incentive program continues to be
highly performance based, aligns our NEOs with
stockholder interests, and strongly protects
against undesirable attrition. The fiscal 2018
equity award was granted fifty percent in
PARSUs and fifty percent in RSUs. The
reintroduction of a PARSU design balances
absolute and relative performance and focuses

2018 PROXY STATEMENT

Executive Compensation — Compensation Discussion and Analysis (continued)

on both operating and stock price performance.
The PARSU grant vests based on two- and
three-year performance periods, measuring
Corporate Net Income and relative TSR
performance.

• The annual incentive PfR program performance
metrics for Corporate-level Section 16 Officers
will continue to be measured at the Corporate
level, and the MBOs will become a modifier of
financial results rather than an equally weighted
measure.

In fiscal 2018, the HRC Committee will continue its
ongoing evaluation of the overall compensation
system to ensure that it strongly supports the
Company’s talent needs, rewards management for
the successful execution of operating goals and the
long-term vision associated with the recently
completed portfolio restructuring, and aligns pay with
stockholder interests and strong governance
standards.

HPE’S FISCAL 2018 CEO TRANSITION
Ms. Whitman and the Board mutually agreed that
her retirement date would be effective as of
February 1, 2018, and that she would continue to be
a director on HPE’s Board. Ms. Whitman’s fiscal
2018 base salary remained unchanged for the
duration of her tenure as the CEO. Additionally,
Ms. Whitman did not receive a fiscal 2018 annual
equity grant, and will not be eligible for a prorated
annual incentive for fiscal 2018.

In conjunction with the equity modifications that were
approved in May 2016 by the independent members
of the Board, all unvested, outstanding equity held
by Ms. Whitman as of May 24, 2016, vested in full
upon her retirement. Based on HPE’s standard
retirement treatment of equity awards,
Ms. Whitman’s RSUs granted after May 24, 2016,
will continue to vest in full based on their original
vesting schedule. Ms. Whitman’s PCSOs granted
after May 24, 2016 will receive pro rata vesting
treatment only to the extent that performance
conditions are met prior to the forfeiture dates as
described in the ‘‘Fiscal 2017 PCSO Design’’ table.
See the ‘‘Potential Payments Upon Termination or
Change in Control’’ table for details.

Mr. Neri was appointed CEO effective February 1,
2018. His fiscal 2018 base salary and target annual
incentive as President remained unchanged. Upon
his appointment to President and CEO, Mr. Neri’s
base salary increased to $1,000,000 with a target
annual incentive of 150%. Mr. Neri’s fiscal 2018
annual equity award, in the amount of $9,000,000,
reflected his appointment to President and CEO.

Mr. Gomez was granted a $1 million strategic
retention award, which is subject to certain
conditions including performance criteria and
continued employment with the Company as of
June 1, 2018, in order to ensure continuity of critical
marketing and communications support for
organizational and product portfolio transformations
in connection with the HPE Next initiative.

CHANGES TO RETIREMENT
PROVISIONS FOR EQUITY AWARDS IN
FISCAL 2018
United States employees are eligible for favorable
vesting treatment of equity awards held at the time
of retirement, contingent on compliance with
restrictive covenants. Retirement is defined as
55 years of age or more, with age plus years of
service totaling at least 70 at the time of termination.

Under HPE’s prior policy, an employee was entitled
to full accelerated vesting of all unvested PARSUs
upon termination following the attainment of
retirement eligibility. To align with the retirement
treatment of time-vested RSUs and options, effective
for all PARSUs granted on or after December 7,
2017, the HRC Committee approved a change to the
vesting treatment so that, upon retirement three
months or more after the grant date, the awards will
continue vesting on the original vesting schedule,
subject to actual performance. To the extent that
retirement occurs within three months after the grant
date, the awards will be immediately forfeited.

ACCOUNTING AND TAX EFFECTS
The impact of accounting treatment is considered in
developing and implementing our compensation
programs, including the accounting treatment as it
applies to amounts awarded or paid to our
executives.

The impact of federal tax laws on our compensation
programs is also considered, including the
deductibility of compensation paid to the NEOs, as
limited by Section 162(m) of the Code. Our
compensation program is designed with the intention
that compensation paid in various forms may be
eligible to qualify for deductibility under
Section 162(m) of the Code, but there have been
and may be other exceptions for administrative or
other reasons. In addition, the recent elimination of
the performance-based compensation exception
under Section 162(m) of the Code as a result of the
recent enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of
2017 will have an effect on our future compensation
programs. However, based on the text of that law,
HPE should have the benefit of the performance-
based exception for fiscal 2018 compensation.

The grant date fair value of all stock awards has been calculated in
accordance with applicable accounting standards. For information
on the assumptions used to calculate the fair value of the awards,
refer to Note 7 to our ‘‘Consolidated and Combined Financial
Statements’’ in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended October 31, 2017, as filed with the SEC on December 15,
2017. In the case of RSUs, the value is determined by multiplying
the number of units granted by the closing price of HPE’s stock on
the grant date.

In connection with both the ES/CSC and SW/Micro Focus
spin-merge transactions, outstanding HPE equity awards were
converted using ratios that preserved the intrinsic value of the
awards as of the conversion dates. One-time incremental
accounting costs were incurred with respect to the ES/CSC
spin-merge, and are included in the table below. Accounting costs

2018 PROXY STATEMENT

Executive Compensation — Compensation Discussion and Analysis (continued)

(5) Amounts shown represent payouts under the PfR program.
Such amounts were earned during the applicable fiscal year
but paid after the end of that fiscal year.

(6) Amounts shown represent the increase in actuarial present
value of NEO pension benefits during the applicable fiscal
year, as described in more detail under ‘‘Narrative to the
Fiscal 2017 Pension Benefits Table’’ below. Pension benefits
have ceased accruing for all NEOs, and NEOs hired after
the accrual cessation date for a pension plan are not eligible
to participate in the plan. The amounts reported for the
NEOs do not reflect additional accruals, but reflect the
passage of one more year from the prior present value
calculation and changes in other actuarial assumptions. In
fiscal 2017, there was an increase to the discount rate that

resulted in a decrease to the actuarial present value of
Mr. Neri’s pension benefit. The assumptions used in
calculating the changes in pension benefits are described in
footnote (3) to the ‘‘Fiscal 2017 Pension Benefits Table’’
below.

(7)

The amounts shown are detailed in the ‘‘Fiscal 2017 All
Other Compensation Table’’ below.

(8) Effective August 31, 2017, Mr. Hsu separated from HPE to

become CEO of the newly combined Software and Micro
Focus Company. However, since his compensation
exceeded that of the next most highly compensated
executive officer, he is reported as an NEO in this proxy
statement.

2017 under the HPE EDCP with respect to contributions
made in November through December 2016. No NEO
earned matching contributions beginning in January 2017.

(3) Represents benefits provided under our standard company

relocation program.

(4) Represents home security services provided to

Ms. Whitman. Consistent with SEC guidance, the expense is
reported here as a perquisite because there is an incidental
personal benefit.

(6)

(5)

For purposes of reporting the value of such personal usage
in this table, we use data provided by an outside firm to
calculate the hourly cost of operating each type of aircraft.
These costs include the cost of fuel, maintenance, landing
and parking fees, crew, catering, and supplies. For trips by
NEOs that involve mixed personal and business usage, we
include the incremental cost of such personal usage
(i.e., the excess of the cost of the actual trip over the cost of
a hypothetical trip without the personal usage). Personal

usage is imputed as income to the executives under the
applicable tax rules and no tax gross-ups are provided for
this imputed income. In addition, in fiscal 2017, Ms. Whitman
entered into a renewal of a ‘‘time-sharing agreement,’’ under
which she reimbursed the Company for those costs
permitted to be charged under federal regulations incurred in
connection with certain personal travel on corporate aircraft
above a certain amount. Ms. Whitman reimbursed the
Company $112,906 related to her and her passengers’
personal use of corporate aircraft during fiscal 2017 reported
under the timeshare agreement.

Includes amounts paid either directly to the executives or on
their behalf for financial counseling, as follows:
Ms. Whitman: $18,000; Mr. Schultz: $18,000; and Mr. Hsu:
$16,521. In addition, values include an employer charitable
donation match of $1,000 for Ms. Whitman, $20,500 for
Mr. Stonesifer, $20,000 for Mr. Schultz, and $8,000 for
Mr. Hsu. Also, includes $25,650 for Ms. Whitman and
$3,719 for Mr. Stonesifer of imputed income with respect to
attendance at HPE events by personal guests.
Ms. Whitman’s value also includes a benefits-excess credit
in the amount of $3,225 for underutilization of HPE benefits.

RSUs vest as to one third of the units on each of the first three
anniversaries of the grant date, subject to continued service.
The transaction accounting costs shown as ‘‘ES/CSC’’ NQ and PCSO do
not represent new grants. Instead, the values represent the number of
target units associated with the incremental compensation cost of
transaction-related changes in the accounting value of outstanding
options. In connection with the Enterprise Services spin-merge
transaction, outstanding HPE equity awards were converted using a ratio
that preserved the intrinsic value of the awards as of the conversion
date. Accounting costs for the Software spin-merge were determined to
be immaterial.

(6)

The number of shares and option exercise prices (representing the fair
market value of HPE stock on the grant date) were converted as a result
of both the ES/CSC and SW/Micro Focus spin-merge transactions using
ratios that preserved the intrinsic value of the award as of the conversion
date.

See footnotes two and four to the ‘‘Summary Compensation Table’’ for a
description of the method used to determine the grant date fair value of
stock awards. This value may differ from the value represented in the

The number of shares and option exercise prices (representing the
fair market value of HPE stock on the grant date) were previously
converted in connection with the separation from HP Inc., and in
fiscal 2017, were converted as a result of both the ES/CSC and
SW/Micro Focus spin-merge transactions using ratios that preserved
the intrinsic value of the award as of the conversion date.

(2) Option awards in this column vest with continued service on each of

the first, second, and third anniversaries of the date of grant. In
conjunction with equity award modifications approved in May 2016,

the final tranche of the November 2, 2015, and December 9, 2015
option awards are expected to vest in June 2018.

(3) Option awards in this column vest upon satisfaction of certain stock
price performance conditions and subject to continued service as to
one third of the shares on each of the first, second, and third
anniversaries of the date of grant, or upon later satisfaction of
certain stock price performance conditions. The stock price
performance goals for the fiscal 2015 PCSOs, granted on
December 10, 2014, were not met by December 10, 2017, and
therefore the shares were forfeited.

(1) Ms. Whitman and Messrs. Stonesifer, Schultz, Gomez, and

Hsu are not eligible to receive benefits under any HPE
defined benefit pension plan because HPE did not retain
sponsorship of the pension plan (if any) in which they
participated, when it separated from HP.

(2)

The ‘‘Nederland Plan’’ refers to the Stichting Pensioenfonds
Hewlett Packard Nederland, a multiple employer pension
under which HPE currently participates. The ‘‘IRG’’ refers to
the International Retirement Guarantee.

(3) Because the change in the pension table amounts from
those for the prior fiscal year determine the increase in
pension value, both the current assumptions as of
October 31, 2017 and for the prior fiscal year as of
October 31, 2016 have been included in the following
description. Mr. Neri participated in an HP pension plan
while employed in the Netherlands. As of October 31, 2017,
the present value for this plan benefit is based on a discount

rate of 1.92% and mortality in accordance with the AG
forecast table 2016. As of October 31, 2016, the
assumptions included a discount rate of 1.50% and mortality
in accordance with the AG forecast table 2016. The earliest
unreduced retirement age in the Dutch pension plan is
age 67. Due to his transfer from the Netherlands to the U.S.
at the request of the Company, Mr. Neri is also covered
under the IRG. As of October 31, 2017, the present value of
IRG benefits is based on a discount rate of 3.34%, lump
sum interest rates of 1.96% for the first five years, 3.58% for
the next 15 years and 4.35% thereafter, and applicable
mortality. As of October 31, 2016, the assumptions included
a discount rate of 3.15%, lump sum interest rates of 1.47%
for the first five years, 3.34% for the next 15 years and
4.30% thereafter, and applicable mortality. The earliest
unreduced retirement age for the IRG based on Mr. Neri’s
employment history is age 65.

NARRATIVE TO THE FISCAL 2017 PENSION BENEFITS TABLE
HPE does not sponsor any qualified U.S. defined benefit pension plans and only participates in one
nonqualified U.S. defined benefit retirement plan for selected international transfers. As a result, no NEO
currently accrues a benefit under any U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan. Benefits previously accrued
by an NEO under non-U.S. HPE pension plans are payable to them following termination of employment,
subject to the terms of the applicable plan. Mr. Neri who is a participant in the nonqualified U.S. plan for
international transfers has the potential to accrue a benefit under the IRG, but only in the event that HPE
requires him to change the country of his employment.

TERMS OF THE NETHERLANDS PENSION PROGRAM
Mr. Neri earned a pension benefit under a Netherlands pension program based on his final pay and years of
service while employed by HP in the Netherlands. The pension plan considers a pensionable base which is
salary less an offset; the offset reflects the Dutch social security benefits which do not vary with pay levels. The
annual accrual that was provided when Mr. Neri participated was 1.75% of his final pensionable base. There is
also a 70% spouse’s benefit provided upon his death while receiving retirement payments. The benefit under
the Dutch pension plan is subject to an annual conditional indexation. In 2014, with Dutch law changes to

extend unreduced retirement ages, all previously accrued benefits were converted to a pension commencing at
age 67.

TERMS OF THE INTERNATIONAL RETIREMENT GUARANTEE
Employees who transferred internationally at HP’s request prior to 2000 were put into an international umbrella
plan. This plan determines the country of guarantee which is generally the country in which an employee has
spent the longest portion of his HP or HPE career. For Mr. Neri, the country of guarantee is currently the U.S.
The IRG determines the present value of a full career benefit for Mr. Neri under the HP sponsored retirement
benefit plans that applied to employees working in the US prior to separation of HPE from HP, and to the HPE
401(k) Plan after separation, and U.S. Social Security (since the U.S. is his country of guarantee) then offsets
the present value of the retirement benefits from plans and social insurance systems in the countries in which
he earned retirement benefits for his total period of HP and HPE employment. The net benefit value is payable
as a single sum as soon as practicable after termination or retirement. This is a nonqualified retirement plan.

We do not sponsor any other supplemental defined benefit pension plans or special retiree medical benefit
plans for executive officers.

The amounts reported here as ‘‘Executive Contributions’’
and ‘‘Registrant Contributions’’ are reported as
compensation to such NEO in the ‘‘Summary Compensation
Table’’ above.

The contributions reported here as ‘‘Registrant
Contributions’’ were made in fiscal 2017 with respect to
November and December 2016 participant base pay

deferrals. Beginning January 2017, the NEOs did not
participate in base pay deferral and did not earn matching
contributions.

(3)

Following the closure of the Software spin-merge, Mr. Hsu’s
deferred compensation balance of $400,271 was transferred
to Micro Focus.

NARRATIVE TO THE FISCAL 2017 NON-QUALIFIED DEFERRED
COMPENSATION TABLE
The amounts reported in the Fiscal 2017 Non-qualified Deferred Compensation Table were provided under the
EDCP, a non-qualified deferred compensation plan that permits eligible U.S. employees to defer base pay in
excess of the amount taken into account under the qualified HPE 401(k) Plan and bonus amounts of up to
95% of the annual incentive bonus payable under the PfR program. In addition, a matching contribution is
available under the plan to eligible employees. The matching contribution applies to base pay deferrals on
compensation above the Code limit that applies to the qualified HPE 401(k) Plan up to a maximum of two
times that compensation limit (for fiscal 2017 matching contributions were available on calendar year 2016
base pay from $265,000 to $530,000). Beginning in January 2017, the NEOs were eligible for a matching

contribution up to 3% on base pay contributions in excess of the Code limit up to a maximum of two times that
limit. In effect, the EDCP permits these executives and all eligible employees to receive a 401(k)-type matching
contribution on a portion of base pay deferrals in excess of Code limits.

Upon becoming eligible for participation, employees must specify the amount of base pay and/or the
percentage of annual incentives to be deferred, as well as the time and form of payment. If termination of
employment occurs before retirement (defined under the EDCP as at least age 55 with 15 years of service),
distribution is made in the form of a lump sum in January of the year following the year of termination, subject
to any delay required under Section 409A of the Code. At retirement (or earlier, if properly elected), benefits
are paid according to the distribution election made by the participant at the time of the deferral election subject
to any delay required under Section 409A of the Code. No withdrawals are permitted prior to the previously
elected distribution date, other than hardship withdrawals as permitted by applicable law.

Amounts deferred or credited under the EDCP are credited with notional investment earnings based on
participant investment elections made from among the investment options available under the HPE 401(k) Plan.
Accounts maintained for participants under the EDCP are not held in trust, and all such accounts are subject to
the claims of general creditors of HPE. No amounts are credited with above-market earnings.

The total excludes amounts earned, or benefits accumulated,
due to continued service by each NEO through October 31,
2017, including vested stock options, PCSOs, RSUs, PARSUs,
accrued retirement benefits, and vested balances in the EDCP,
as those amounts are detailed in the preceding tables. The total
also excludes amounts each NEO was eligible to receive under
the annual PfR program with respect to fiscal 2017
performance. For Mr. Neri, the total excludes amounts payable
from the Netherlands pension programs in which he
participates, as those are fully described in the ‘‘Fiscal 2017
Pension Benefits Table’’ above.

(2)

For Ms. Whitman, the amounts reported represent the cash
benefits payable under the SPEO (as defined below) pursuant
to Ms. Whitman’s employment offer letter, which provides that
Ms. Whitman was entitled to receive severance benefits

payable under the SPEO at the rate applicable to an EVP
rather than the rate applicable to the CEO (i.e., using a 1.5x
multiple of base pay plus the three-year average of annual
incentive payments, rather than the 2.0x multiplier otherwise
applicable to the CEO under the SPEO). For the other NEOs,
the amounts reported are the cash benefits payable in the
event of a qualifying termination under the SPEO.

(3) All outstanding equity held by HPE employees as of May 24,

2016 vest in full upon the termination of the employee’s
employment by the Company without cause (as defined in the
SPEO). This includes termination due to disability, death, and
change in control. PCSOs held as of May 24, 2016, will vest in
full without regard to whether the stock price component or
other performance-based requirements of the award have been
met.

2016 by the independent members of the Board, and as further
described in the ‘‘HPE’s Fiscal 2018 CEO Transition’’ section,
the total estimated value of Ms. Whitman’s unvested equity
upon her retirement was $23,638,324 (based on the $13.92
closing price of HPE stock on October 31, 2017). This

consisted of stock options in the amount of $7,371,342, RSUs
in the amount of $10,078,247, and PARSUs in the amount of
$6,188,735.

(6) Represents the value of Mr. Hsu’s equity that vested as a result

of his separation from HPE to become the CEO of the newly
combined Software and Micro Focus Company. Value
calculated based on the $14.13 opening price of HPE stock on
September 1, 2017 following the Software spin-merge
transaction.

NARRATIVE TO THE POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR
CHANGE IN CONTROL TABLE
This narrative reflects plans and provisions in effect as of October 31, 2017. In fiscal 2017, Section 16 Officers
(including all of the NEOs) were covered by our Severance and Long-Term Incentive Change in Control Plan for
Executive Officers (‘‘SPEO’’), which was intended to protect HPE and its stockholders, and provide a level of
transition assistance in the event of an involuntary termination of employment. Under the SPEO, participants who
incur an involuntary termination, not for cause, and who execute a full release of claims following such termination,
which release has not been revoked or attempted to be revoked, are eligible to receive severance benefits in an
amount determined as a multiple of the sum of base pay and the average of the actual annual incentives paid for
the preceding three years. In the case of the NEOs other than the CEO, the multiplier is 1.5. In the case of the
CEO, the multiplier is 2.0, although Ms. Whitman elected to be eligible for the same multiplier as the other NEOs. In
all cases, the SPEO benefit will not exceed 2.99 times the sum of the executive’s base pay plus target annual
incentive as in effect immediately prior to the termination of employment.

In addition to the cash benefit, the participants in the SPEO were eligible to receive (1) a pro rata annual incentive
award for the year of termination based on actual performance results, (2) pro rata vesting of unvested equity
awards if any applicable performance conditions have been satisfied, and (3) a lump-sum health-benefit stipend in
an amount equal to 18 months’ COBRA premiums for continued group medical coverage for the executive and his
or her eligible dependents, to the extent those premiums exceed 18 times the monthly premiums for active
employees in the same plan with the same level of coverage as of the date of termination.

VOLUNTARY OR FOR ‘‘CAUSE’’ TERMINATION
In general, an NEO who remained employed through October 31, 2017, (the last day of the fiscal year), but
voluntarily terminated employment immediately thereafter, or was terminated immediately thereafter in a for ‘‘cause’’
termination, would be eligible to (1) receive his or her annual incentive amount earned for fiscal 2017 under the PfR
program (subject to any discretionary downward adjustment or elimination by the HRC Committee prior to actual
payment, and to any applicable clawback policy), (2) exercise his or her vested stock options up to three months
following termination, (3) receive a distribution of vested amounts deferred or credited under the EDCP, and
(4) receive a distribution of his or her vested benefits, if any, under the HPE 401(k) Plan (and Mr. Neri would also be
entitled to his pensions that are payable under the IRG and the pension programs available in the Netherlands). An
NEO who terminated employment before October 31, 2017, either voluntarily or in a for ‘‘cause’’ termination, would
generally not have been eligible to receive any amount under the PfR program with respect to the fiscal year in
which the termination occurred, except that the HRC Committee has the discretion to make payment of prorated
bonus amounts to individuals on leave of absence or in non-pay status, as well as in connection with certain
voluntary severance incentives, workforce reductions, and similar programs.

NOT FOR ‘‘CAUSE’’ TERMINATION
A not for ‘‘cause’’ termination of an NEO who remained employed through October 31, 2017 and was terminated
immediately thereafter would qualify the NEO for the amounts described above under a ‘‘voluntary’’ termination in
addition to benefits under the SPEO if the NEO signs the required release of claims in favor of HPE. In addition to

HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE

Executive Compensation — Compensation Discussion and Analysis (continued)

the cash severance benefits and pro rata equity awards payable under the SPEO, the NEO would be eligible to
exercise vested stock options up to one year after termination. The NEO’s equity awards that were subject to
modification on May 24, 2016, would also be subject to full accelerated vesting.

TERMINATION FOLLOWING A CHANGE IN CONTROL
The SPEO provides for full accelerated vesting of outstanding stock options, RSUs, and PCSOs upon involuntary
termination not for cause or voluntary termination for good reason (as defined in the SPEO) within 24 months after a
change in control in which HPE is the survivor or the survivor assumes or replaces the equity awards (‘‘double
trigger’’), with PARSUs vesting based on target performance. In situations where HPE is not the survivor and equity
awards are not assumed by the surviving corporation, vesting will be automatically accelerated upon the change in
control, with PARSUs vesting based upon the greater of the number of PARSUs that would vest based on actual
performance and the number of PARSUs that would vest pro rata based upon target performance. In addition, the
equity awards granted to NEOs that were subject to modification on May 24, 2016, would be subject to full
accelerated vesting.

DEATH OR DISABILITY TERMINATIONS
An NEO who continued employment through October 31, 2017 and whose employment was terminated immediately
thereafter due to death or disability would be eligible to (1) receive his or her full annual incentive amount earned for
fiscal 2017 determined by HPE in its sole discretion, (2) receive a distribution of vested amounts deferred or credited
under the EDCP, and (3) receive a distribution of his or her vested benefits under the HPE 401(k) Plan and any
HP Inc. pension plans.

Upon termination due to death or disability, stock options, RSUs, and PCSOs held by the NEO would vest in full
without regard to the satisfaction of applicable performance conditions. PARSUs held by the NEO will vest in full at
the target amount. If the termination was due to disability, stock options and PCSOs must be exercised within three
years of termination or by the original expiration date, if earlier. If the termination was due to death, stock options
and PCSOs must be exercised within one year of termination or by the original expiration date, if earlier.

HPE RETIREMENT ARRANGEMENTS
Upon retirement on or after age 55, with age plus years of service totaling at least 70 at the time of termination,
HPE employees in the United States are entitled to the benefits described below. For equity awards granted prior to
November 1, 2016, HPE employees in the United States receive full vesting of time-vested options and time-vested
RSUs granted under our stock plans with a three-year post-termination exercise period in the case of options.
PCSOs will receive prorated vesting if the stock price appreciation conditions are met and may vest on a prorated
basis following termination until the end of the performance period, subject to satisfaction of stock price appreciation
conditions and certain post-employment restrictions. For equity awards granted after November 1, 2016, if retirement
occurs three months or more after the grant date, employees receive full vesting of time-vested options and
time-vested RSUs. These awards will continue vesting on the original vesting schedule. To the extent that retirement
occurs within three months after the grant date, such awards will be immediately forfeited. PCSOs are subject to pro
rata vesting on retirement, subject to attaining the stock price performance goals. PARSUs (whether granted as units
or stock), if any, are paid on a prorated basis to retired participants at the end of the performance period based on
actual results, and bonuses, if any, under the annual incentive program may be paid in prorated amounts at the
discretion of the HRC Committee based on actual results. If required in accordance with Section 409A of the Code,
certain amounts payable upon retirement (or other termination of employment) of the NEOs and other key
employees will not be paid out for at least six months following termination of employment.

The HPE-sponsored U.S. retiree medical program, for which our NEOs may be eligible, provides eligible retirees
with access to coverage at group rates only, with no direct subsidy provided by HPE. All NEOs could be eligible for
this program if they retire from HPE on or after age 55 with at least ten years of qualifying service or a combination
of age plus years of service totaling at least 80. In addition, beginning at age 45, eligible U.S. employees may

participate in the HPE Retirement Medical Savings Account Plan (the ‘‘RMSA’’), under which participants are eligible
to receive HPE matching credits of up to $1,200 per year, beginning at age 45, and provided that the employee’s
most recent hire date with HP was prior to August 1, 2008, up to a lifetime maximum of $12,000, which can be used
to cover the cost of such retiree medical coverage (or other qualifying medical expenses) if the employee retires
from HPE on or after age 55 with at least ten years of qualifying service or a combination of age plus years of
service totaling at least 80. Mr. Neri is the only NEO currently eligible for the HPE matching credits under the RMSA.
HPE continues to sponsor this program for its employees after the separation from HP.

Audit-Related Matters (continued)
Audit Committee Composition
The Audit Committee of Hewlett Packard Enterprise is composed of four directors, Michael J. Angelakis,
Leslie A. Brun, Pamela L. Carter, and Mary Agnes Wilderotter. Ms. Wilderotter serves as the Chair of the Audit
Committee. Every member of the Audit Committee is independent and three, including the Chair, are audit
experts.

Audit Committee Oversight
The purpose of the Audit Committee is to represent and assist the Board of Directors in fulfilling its
responsibilities for generally overseeing our financial reporting process and financial statements, as well as
compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, the independent registered public accounting firm’s
qualifications and independence, the performance of our internal audit function and independent registered
public accounting firm, and risk assessment and risk management. The Audit Committee, in its discretion, may
request a review of any issue it deems necessary to ensure the integrity of the Company’s financial
statements, adherence to regulatory requirements, or adherence with the Company’s ERM program. The Audit
Committee has the authority to obtain advice and assistance from outside legal, accounting or other advisors
as the Audit Committee deems necessary to carry out its duties and receives appropriate funding, as
determined by the Audit Committee, from Hewlett Packard Enterprise for such advice and assistance.

A more expansive listing of the Audit Committee’s duties and responsibilities can be found in the Audit
Committee Charter, which is reviewed annually by the NGSR Committee and available at:
http://investors.hpe.com/~/media/Files/H/HP-Enterprise-IR/documents/committees/audit-committee-charter-
october2015.pdf

.

Selection and Oversight of External Auditor
The Audit Committee appoints, compensates, oversees, and manages Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s
relationship with its independent registered public accounting firm (which reports directly to the Audit
Committee). Ernst & Young LLP, has served as Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s independent registered public
accounting firm since the company’s inception in 2015.

In reviewing and approving audit and non-audit service fees, the Audit Committee considers a number of
factors including scope and quality of work, as well as an assessment of impact on auditor independence of
non-audit fees and services.

In selecting HPE’s independent registered public accounting firm, the Audit Committee conducts an
assessment of the firm’s qualifications and performance; the quality and candor of their communications with
the Audit Committee and the Company; and our auditor’s independence, objectivity, and professionalism.

Committee Meetings
The Audit Committee disposes of its duties through a series of regularly-scheduled meetings, including
dedicated meetings to review quarterly earnings releases and financial filings with the SEC, and regular
communications from the Company on material risk oversight matters. At least six Audit Committee meetings
are held each year. During fiscal 2017, the Audit Committee met a total of 9 times. The Audit Committee
reviews and discusses a number of different topics and items of business in meetings including, but not limited
to, annual risk management overviews, cyber security, internal audit matters, Sarbanes-Oxley 404 plan matters,
ethics and compliance trends and matters, earnings releases, auditor updates, required disclosures, and
business segment specific risk reviews. Management, internal audit, and EY are invited to attend committee
meetings and present on these topics as well as internal and external audit plans and budget forecasts.

account, you may receive a separate notice, a
separate e-mail or a separate voting instruction
card for each brokerage account in which you
hold shares. If you are a stockholder of record
and your shares are registered in more than one
name, you may receive more than one notice,
more than one e-mail or more than one proxy
card. To vote all of your shares by proxy, you
must complete, sign, date and return each proxy
card and voting instruction card that you receive
and vote over the Internet the shares represented
by each notice and e-mail that you receive
(unless you have requested and received a proxy
card or voting instruction card for the shares
represented by one or more of those notices or
e-mails).

Questions and Answers (continued)

14. What is the difference between holding shares
as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial
owner?
Most of our stockholders hold their shares
through a broker, trustee or other nominee rather
than directly in their own name. As summarized
below, there are some distinctions between
shares held of record and those owned
beneficially.
• Stockholder of Record—If your shares are

registered directly in your name with our
transfer agent, you are considered, with
respect to those shares, the ‘‘stockholder of
record.’’ As the stockholder of record, you have
the right to grant your voting proxy directly to
Hewlett Packard Enterprise or to a third party,
or to vote your shares during the meeting.

• Beneficial Owner—If your shares are held in a

brokerage account, by a trustee or by another
nominee (that is, in ‘‘street name’’), you are
considered the ‘‘beneficial owner’’ of those
shares. As the beneficial owner of those
shares, you have the right to direct your
broker, trustee or nominee how to vote, or to
vote your shares during the annual meeting
(other than shares held in the Hewlett Packard
Enterprise Company Plan (the ‘‘Hewlett
Packard Enterprise 401(k) Plan’’), which must
be voted prior to the annual meeting).

15. Who is entitled to vote and how many shares

can I vote?
Each holder of shares of Hewlett Packard
Enterprise common stock issued and outstanding
as of the close of business on February 5, 2018,
the record date for the annual meeting, is entitled
to cast one vote per share on all items being
voted upon at the annual meeting. You may vote
all shares owned by you as of this time, including
(1) shares held directly in your name as the
stockholder of record, including shares purchased
through our dividend reinvestment program and
employee stock purchase plans, and shares held
through our Direct Registration Service; and
(2) shares held for you as the beneficial owner
through a broker, trustee or other nominee.
On the record date, Hewlett Packard Enterprise
Company had approximately 1,566,561,631
shares of common stock issued and outstanding.

2018 PROXY STATEMENT

16. How can I vote my shares during the annual

meeting?
This year’s annual meeting will be held entirely
online to allow greater participation. Stockholders
may participate in the annual meeting by visiting
the following website:

HPE.onlineshareholdermeeting.com

To participate in the annual meeting, you will
need the 16-digit control number included on
your notice of Internet availability of the proxy
materials, on your proxy card or on the
instructions that accompanied your proxy
materials.
Shares held in your name as the stockholder of
record may be voted electronically during the
annual meeting. Shares for which you are the
beneficial owner but not the stockholder of record
also may be voted electronically during the
annual meeting, except that shares held in the
Hewlett Packard Enterprise 401(k) Plan cannot
be voted electronically during the annual meeting.
If you hold shares in the Hewlett Packard
Enterprise 401(k) Plan, your voting instructions
must be received by 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time,
on March 30, 2018 for the trustee to vote your
shares. However, holders of shares in the
Hewlett Packard Enterprise 401(k) Plan will still
be able to view the annual meeting webcast and
ask questions during the annual meeting.
Even if you plan to participate in the annual
meeting online, we recommend that you also
vote by proxy as described below so that your
vote will be counted if you later decide not to
participate in the annual meeting.

17. How can I vote my shares without

participating in the annual meeting?
Whether you hold shares directly as the
stockholder of record or through a broker, trustee
or other nominee as the beneficial owner, you
may direct how your shares are voted without
participating in the annual meeting. There are
three ways to vote by proxy:
• By Internet—Stockholders who have received
a notice of the Internet availability of the proxy
materials by mail may submit proxies over the
Internet by following the instructions on the
notice. Stockholders who have received notice
of the Internet availability of the proxy materials
by e-mail may submit proxies over the Internet
by following the instructions included in the

88

HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE

18NOV201618585199

Questions and Answers (continued)

e-mail. Stockholders who have received a
paper copy of a proxy card or voting instruction
card by mail may submit proxies over the
Internet by following the instructions on the
proxy card or voting instruction card.

• By Telephone—Stockholders of record who

live in the United States or Canada may submit
proxies by telephone by calling 1-800-690-6903
and following the instructions. Stockholders of
record who have received a notice of the
Internet availability of the proxy materials by
mail must have the control number that
appears on their notice available when voting.
Stockholders of record who received notice of
the Internet availability of the proxy materials
by e-mail must have the control number
included in the e-mail available when voting.
Stockholders of record who have received a
proxy card by mail must have the control
number that appears on their proxy card
available when voting. Most stockholders who
are beneficial owners of their shares living in
the United States or Canada and who have
received a voting instruction card by mail may
vote by phone by calling the number specified
on the voting instruction card provided by their
broker, trustee or nominee. Those stockholders
should check the voting instruction card for
telephone voting availability.

• By Mail—Stockholders who have received a

paper copy of a proxy card or voting instruction
card by mail may submit proxies by
completing, signing and dating their proxy card
or voting instruction card and mailing it in the
accompanying pre-addressed envelope.

20.

18. What is the deadline for voting my shares?
If you hold shares as the stockholder of record,
or through the Hewlett Packard Enterprise
Company 2016 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
(the ‘‘ESPP’’), your vote by proxy must be
received before the polls close during the annual
meeting.
If you hold shares in the Hewlett Packard
Enterprise Company 401(k) Plan, your voting
instructions must be received by 11:59 p.m.,
Eastern Time, on March 30, 2018 for the trustee
to vote your shares.
If you are the beneficial owner of shares held
through a broker, trustee or other nominee,

2018 PROXY STATEMENT

please follow the voting instructions provided by
your broker, trustee or nominee.

19. May I change my vote or revoke my proxy?

You may change your vote or revoke your proxy
at any time prior to the vote during the annual
meeting, except that any change to your voting
instructions for shares held in the Hewlett
Packard Enterprise Company 401(k) Plan must
be provided by 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on
March 30, 2018 as described above.
If you are the stockholder of record, you may
change your vote by: (1) granting a new proxy
bearing a later date (which automatically revokes
the earlier proxy); (2) providing a written notice of
revocation to the Corporate Secretary at the
address below in Question 34 prior to your
shares being voted; or (3) voting your shares
electronically during the annual meeting.
Participation in the annual meeting will not cause
your previously granted proxy to be revoked
unless you specifically make that request. For
shares you hold beneficially in the name of a
broker, trustee or other nominee, you may
change your vote by submitting new voting
instructions to your broker, trustee or nominee, or
by participating in the meeting and electronically
voting your shares during the meeting (except
that shares held in the Hewlett Packard
Enterprise 401(k) Plan cannot be voted
electronically at the annual meeting).

Is my vote confidential?
Proxy instructions, ballots and voting tabulations
that identify individual stockholders are handled in
a manner that protects your voting privacy. Your
vote will not be disclosed, either within Hewlett
Packard Enterprise or to third parties, except:
(1) as necessary to meet applicable legal
requirements; (2) to allow for the tabulation of
votes and certification of the vote; and (3) to
facilitate a successful proxy solicitation.
Occasionally, stockholders provide written
comments on their proxy card, which are then
forwarded to management.

21. How are votes counted, and what effect do

abstentions and broker non-votes have on the
proposals?
In the election of directors, you may vote ‘‘FOR,’’
‘‘AGAINST’’ or ‘‘ABSTAIN’’ with respect to each

HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE

89

|

89

18NOV201618585199

Questions and Answers (continued)

2018 PROXY STATEMENT

of the nominees. If you elect to abstain in the
election of directors, the abstention will not
impact the election of directors. In tabulating the
voting results for the election of directors, only
‘‘FOR’’ and ‘‘AGAINST’’ votes are counted.
For all items of business, you may vote ‘‘FOR,’’
‘‘AGAINST’’ or ‘‘ABSTAIN.’’ If you elect to
abstain, the abstention will have the same effect
as an ‘‘AGAINST’’ vote.
If you are the beneficial owner of shares held in
the name of a broker, trustee or other nominee
and do not provide that broker, trustee or other
nominee with voting instructions, your shares
may constitute ‘‘broker non-votes.’’ Generally,
broker non-votes occur on a matter when a
broker is not permitted to vote on that matter
without instructions from the beneficial owner and
instructions are not given. Under the NYSE rules,
brokers, trustees or other nominees may
generally vote on routine matters but cannot vote
on non-routine matters. Only Proposal No. 2
(ratifying the appointment of the independent
registered public accounting firm) is considered a
routine matter. The other proposals are not
considered routine matters, and without your
instructions, your broker cannot vote your shares.
In tabulating the voting results for any particular
proposal, shares that constitute broker non-votes
are not considered, votes cast or entitled to vote
on that proposal. Thus, broker non-votes will not
affect the outcome of any matter being voted on
at the meeting.
If you provide specific instructions with regard to
certain items, your shares will be voted as you
instruct on such items. If you vote by proxy card
or voting instruction card and sign the card
without giving specific instructions, your shares
will be voted in accordance with the
recommendations of the Board (FOR all of our
nominees to the Board, FOR ratification of the
appointment of our independent registered public
accounting firm, FOR the approval of the
compensation of our named executive officers,
and AGAINST the stockholder proposal related to
action by written consent of stockholders.
For any shares you hold in the Hewlett Packard
Enterprise 401(k) Plan, if your voting instructions

are not received by 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on
March 30, 2018, your shares will be voted in
proportion to the way the shares held by the
other Hewlett Packard Enterprise 401(k) Plan
participants are voted, except as may be
otherwise required by law.

22. What is the voting requirement to approve

each of the proposals?
In the election of directors, each director will be
elected by the vote of the majority of votes cast
with respect to that director nominee. A majority
of votes cast means that the number of votes
cast for a nominee’s election must exceed the
number of votes cast against such nominee’s
election. Each nominee receiving more votes
‘‘FOR’’ his or her election than votes ‘‘AGAINST’’
his or her election will be elected. Approval of
each of the other proposals requires the
affirmative vote of a majority of the shares
present, in person or represented by proxy, and
entitled to vote on that proposal at the annual
meeting.

23. What if I have questions for our transfer

agent?
Please contact our transfer agent, at the phone

STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS,
DIRECTOR NOMINATIONS AND
RELATED BYLAW PROVISIONS
34. What is the deadline to propose actions

(other than director nominations) for
consideration at next year’s annual meeting of
stockholders?
You may submit proposals for consideration at
future stockholder meetings. For a stockholder
proposal to be considered for inclusion in our
proxy statement for the annual meeting next
year, the Corporate Secretary must receive the
written proposal at our principal executive offices
no later than October 16, 2018. Such proposals
also must comply with SEC regulations under

2018 PROXY STATEMENT

Rule 14a-8 regarding the inclusion of stockholder
proposals in company-sponsored proxy materials.
Proposals should be addressed to:

Corporate Secretary

Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company

3000 Hanover Street MS 1050

Palo Alto, California 94304

Fax: (650) 857-4837
bod-hpe@hpe.com

For a stockholder proposal that is not intended to
be included in our proxy statement for next year’s
annual meeting under Rule 14a-8, the
stockholder must provide the information required
by our Bylaws and give timely notice to the
Corporate Secretary in accordance with our
Bylaws, which, in general, require that the notice
be received by the Corporate Secretary:
• not earlier than the close of business on

December 5, 2018; and

• not later than the close of business on

January 4, 2019.

If the date of the stockholder meeting is moved
more than 30 days before or 60 days after the
anniversary of our annual meeting for the prior
year, then notice of a stockholder proposal that is
not intended to be included in our proxy
statement under Rule 14a-8 must be received no
earlier than the close of business 120 days prior
to the meeting and not later than the close of
business on the later of the following two dates:
• 90 days prior to the meeting; and
• 10 days after public announcement of the

meeting date.

Deadlines for the nomination of director
candidates are discussed in Question 36 below.

35. How may I recommend individuals to serve as

directors and what is the deadline for a
director recommendation?
You may recommend director candidates for
consideration by the NGSR Committee. Any such
recommendations should include verification of
the stockholder status of the person submitting
the recommendation and the nominee’s name
and qualifications for Board membership and
should be directed to the Corporate Secretary at
the address of our principal executive offices set
forth in Question 34 above. See ‘‘Proposal
No. 1—Election of Directors—Director Nominee
Experience and Qualifications’’ for more

92

Questions and Answers (continued)

information regarding our Board membership
criteria.
A stockholder may send a recommended director
candidate’s name and information to the Board at
any time. Generally, such proposed candidates
are considered at the first or second Board
meeting prior to the issuance of the proxy
statement for our annual meeting.

36. How may I nominate individuals to serve as

directors and what are the deadlines for a
director nomination?
Our Bylaws permit stockholders to nominate
directors for consideration at an annual meeting.
To nominate a director for consideration at an
annual meeting (but not for inclusion in our proxy
statement), a nominating stockholder must
provide the information required by our Bylaws
and give timely notice of the nomination to the
Corporate Secretary in accordance with our
Bylaws, and each nominee must meet the
qualifications required by our Bylaws. To
nominate a director for consideration at next
year’s annual meeting, in general the notice must
be received by the Corporate Secretary between
the close of business on December 5, 2018 and
the close of business on January 4, 2019, unless
the annual meeting is moved by more than
30 days before or 60 days after the anniversary
of the prior year’s annual meeting, in which case
the deadline will be as described in Question 34
above.
In addition, our Bylaws provide that under certain
circumstances, a stockholder or group of
stockholders may include director candidates that
they have nominated in our annual meeting proxy
statement. These proxy access provisions of our
Bylaws provide, among other things, that a
stockholder or group of up to twenty stockholders
seeking to include director candidates in our
annual meeting proxy statement must own 3% or
more of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s outstanding
common stock continuously for at least the
previous three years. The number of stockholder-
nominated candidates appearing in any annual
meeting proxy statement cannot exceed 20% of

2018 PROXY STATEMENT

the number of directors then serving on the
Board. If 20% is not a whole number, the
maximum number of stockholder-nominated
candidates would be the closest whole number
below 20%. Based on the current Board size of
13 directors, the maximum number of proxy
access candidates that we would be required to
include in our proxy materials for an annual
meeting is two. Nominees submitted under the
proxy access procedures that are later withdrawn
or are included in the proxy materials as Board-
nominated candidates will be counted in
determining whether the 20% maximum has been
reached. If the number of stockholder-nominated
candidates exceeds 20%, each nominating
stockholder or group of stockholders may select
one nominee for inclusion in our proxy materials
until the maximum number is reached. The order
of selection would be determined by the amount
(largest to smallest) of shares of Hewlett Packard
Enterprise common stock held by each
nominating stockholder or group of stockholders.
The nominating stockholder or group of
stockholders also must deliver the information
required by our Bylaws, and each nominee must
meet the qualifications required by our Bylaws.
Requests to include stockholder-nominated
candidates in our proxy materials for next year’s
annual meeting must be received by the
Corporate Secretary:
• not earlier than the close of business on

December 5, 2018; and

• not later than the close of business on

January 4, 2019.

37. How may I obtain a copy of the provisions of
our Bylaws regarding stockholder proposals
and director nominations?
You may contact the Corporate Secretary at our
principal executive offices for a copy of the
relevant Bylaws provisions regarding the
requirements for making stockholder proposals
and nominating director candidates. Our Bylaws
also are available on our website at
investors.hpe.com/governance/

ITEM 1. Business

PART I

We are an industry leading technology company that enables customers to go further, faster. With a deep
and comprehensive portfolio, spanning the cloud to the data center to the intelligent edge, our technology and
services help customers around the world deliver business outcomes. Our legacy dates back to a partnership
founded in 1939 by William R. Hewlett and David Packard, and we strive every day to uphold and enhance
that legacy through our dedication to providing innovative technological solutions to our customers.

On November 1, 2015, HP Inc. (‘‘former Parent’’), formerly known as Hewlett-Packard Company

(‘‘HP Co.’’), spun-off Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (‘‘we’’, ‘‘us’’, ‘‘our’’, ‘‘Hewlett Packard Enterprise’’,
‘‘HPE’’, or ‘‘the Company’’), pursuant to a separation agreement (the ‘‘Separation and Distribution Agreement’’)
(collectively, the ‘‘Separation’’). To effect the spin-off, HP Inc. distributed all of the shares of Hewlett Packard
Enterprise common stock owned by HP Inc. to its shareholders on November 1, 2015. Holders of HP Inc.
common stock received one share of Hewlett Packard Enterprise stock for every share of HP Inc. stock held as
of the record date. As a result of the spin-off, we now operate as an independent, publicly traded company.

Enterprise Services Separation Transaction

On April 1, 2017, we completed the separation and merger of our Enterprise Services business with

Computer Sciences Corporation (‘‘CSC’’) (collectively, the ‘‘Everett Transaction’’). The Everett Transaction was
accomplished by a series of transactions among CSC, HPE, Everett SpinCo, Inc. (a wholly-owned subsidiary of
HPE) (‘‘Everett’’), and New Everett Merger Sub Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Everett (‘‘Merger Sub’’). We
transferred our Enterprise Services business to Everett and distributed all of the shares of Everett to HPE
stockholders. HPE stockholders received 0.085904 shares of common stock in the new company for every one
share of HPE common stock held at the close of business on the record date. Following the distribution, the
Merger Sub merged with and into CSC, which became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Everett. At the time of the
merger, Everett changed its name to DXC Technology Company (‘‘DXC’’).

Software Segment Separation Transaction

On September 1, 2017, we completed the separation and merger of our Software business segment with
Micro Focus International plc (‘‘Micro Focus’’) (collectively, the ‘‘Seattle Transaction’’). The Seattle Transaction
was accomplished by a series of transactions among HPE, Micro Focus, Seattle SpinCo, Inc. (a wholly-owned
subsidiary of HPE) (‘‘Seattle’’), and Seattle MergerSub, Inc., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Micro Focus
(‘‘Merger Sub’’). We transferred our Software business segment to Seattle and distributed all of the shares of
Seattle to HPE stockholders. HPE stockholders received 0.13732611 American Depository Shares (‘‘Micro
Focus ADSs’’) in the new company, each of which represents one ordinary share of Micro Focus, for every one
share of HPE common stock held at the close of business on the record date. Following the share distribution,
the Merger Sub merged with and into Seattle which became an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Micro
Focus.

With the completion of the Everett and Seattle Transactions, we have reclassified the historical financial

results of our former Enterprise Services segment (‘‘former ES segment’’) and our former Software segment to
Net loss from discontinued operations in our Consolidated and Combined Statements of Earnings, and to
assets and liabilities of discontinued operations in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

HPE Next

During the third quarter of fiscal 2017, we launched an initiative called HPE Next, through which we will

architect a purpose-built company designed to compete and win in the markets where we participate. Through
this initiative, we will simplify our operating model and the way we work. We will streamline our offerings and
business processes to improve our execution. More importantly, we will continue to shift our investments in
innovation towards high growth and higher margin solutions and services.

This initiative includes consolidating our manufacturing and support services locations, streamlining our

business systems and reducing the number of countries in which we have a direct sales presence, while
simultaneously migrating to a channel-only model in the remaining countries.

HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE

The HPE Next initiative is expected to be implemented through fiscal 2020. During this time, we expect to

incur expenses for workforce reductions, to upgrade and simplify our IT infrastructure, and for other non-labor
actions. These costs will be partially offset by proceeds received from real estate sales.

We expect to achieve gross cost savings of $1.5 billion exiting fiscal 2020. After investing approximately

$700 million of the gross savings back into the business, we expect to achieve annual run-rate net cost savings
of approximately $800 million exiting fiscal 2020.

Our Strategy

HPE’s strategy is based on three key pillars:

First, we make Hybrid IT simple through secure, software-defined offerings that enable customers to move

data seamlessly across their on-premises data centers, private cloud, managed cloud and public cloud
environments. HPE has a deep portfolio of technology solutions to enable the right mix of Hybrid IT to drive the
business outcomes our customers are looking for. Our portfolio includes industry standard servers,
hyperconverged offerings, high performance compute, composable infrastructure, all-flash storage, networking,
private cloud and multi-cloud management software. Equally important to enabling the right mix of Hybrid IT are
our partnerships with other leading technology companies.

Second, we power the intelligent edge that runs campus, branch and Internet of Things (‘‘IoT’’)

applications. We provide the technology that enables deeply connected digital workplaces, intelligently
monitored operations and transformative customer experiences for our enterprise customers. Our market-
leading portfolio includes software-defined, secure, wireless and wired networking technology and innovative
converged systems that combine compute, control, data acquisition, and iLO systems management, specifically
designed for industrial IoT environments.

Third, we provide world-class expertise and flexible consumption models to help customers transform their

IT environments. HPE’s Pointnext technology services organization provides the expertise and financial
services support customers need. Pointnext draws on the expertise of more than 25,000 specialists worldwide
to support customers across Advisory and Transformation Services, Professional Services and Operational
Services. These teams collaborate with businesses worldwide to speed their adoption of emerging
technologies, including cloud computing and hybrid IT, big data and analytics, the Intelligent Edge, and IoT.

Our Strengths

We believe that we possess a number of competitive advantages that distinguish us from our competitors,

including:

Strong solutions portfolio for the data center, cloud and intelligent edge. We combine our software-

defined infrastructure and services capabilities to provide what we believe is the strongest portfolio of enterprise
solutions in the IT industry. Our ability to deliver a comprehensive IT strategy, from the cloud to the data center
to the intelligent edge, through our high-quality products and high-value consulting and support services in a
single package is one of our principal differentiators.

Multiyear innovation roadmap. We have been in the technology and innovation business for over

75 years. Our vast intellectual property portfolio and global research and development capabilities are part of a
broader innovation roadmap designed to help organizations take advantage of the expanding amount of data

HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE

available and leverage the latest technology developments like cloud, artificial intelligence, and cyber security
to drive business outcomes now and in the future.

Global distribution and partner ecosystem. We are experts in delivering innovative technological

solutions to our customers in complex multi-country, multi-vendor and/or multi-language environments. We have
one of the largest go-to-market capabilities in our industry, including a large ecosystem of channel partners,
which enables us to market and deliver our product offerings to customers located virtually anywhere in the
world.

Custom financial solutions. We have developed innovative financing solutions and IT consumption

models to facilitate the delivery of our products and services to our customers. We deliver flexible investment
solutions and expertise that help customers and other partners create unique technology deployments based
on specific business needs.

Experienced leadership team with track record of successful performance. Our management team has

an extensive track record of performance and execution. We are led by our Chief Executive Officer,
Margaret C. Whitman and our President, Antonio Neri, who have proven experience in developing
transformative business models, building global brands and driving sustained growth and expansion in the
technology industry. Ms. Whitman’s experience includes her leadership of HP Co. for four years prior to the
Separation and her prior ten years as Chief Executive Officer of eBay Inc. Mr. Neri’s experience includes over
20 years combined at HPE and HP Co., in various leadership positions. Our senior management team has
over 100 collective years of experience in our industry and possesses extensive knowledge of and experience
in the enterprise IT business and the markets in which we compete. Moreover, we have a deep bench of
management and technology talent that we believe provides us with an unparalleled pipeline of future leaders
and innovators.

Sales, Marketing and Distribution

We manage our business and report our financial results based on the segments described above. Our

customers are organized by commercial and large enterprise groups, including business and public sector
enterprises, and purchases of our products, solutions and services may be fulfilled directly by us or indirectly
through a variety of partners, including:

•

•

•

•

•

•

resellers that sell our products and services, frequently with their own value-added products or
services, to targeted customer groups;

distribution partners that supply our solutions to resellers;

original equipment manufacturers (‘‘OEMs’’) that integrate our products and services with their own
products and services, and sell the integrated solution;

independent software vendors that provide their clients with specialized software products and often
assist us in selling our products and services to clients purchasing their products;

systems integrators that provide expertise in designing and implementing custom IT solutions and
often partner with us to extend their expertise or influence the sale of our products and services; and

advisory firms that provide various levels of management and IT consulting, including some systems
integration work, and typically partner with us on client solutions that require our unique products
and services.

The mix of our business conducted by direct sales or channel differs substantially by business and region.
We believe that customer buying patterns and different regional market conditions require us to tailor our sales,
marketing and distribution efforts accordingly. We are focused on driving the depth and breadth of our
coverage, in addition to identifying efficiencies and productivity gains, in both our direct and indirect businesses.
For example, through our HPE Next initiative, we will reduce the number of countries in which we have a direct
sales presence, while simultaneously migrating to a channel-only model in the remaining countries. We typically
assign an account manager to manage relationships across our business with large enterprise customers. The
account manager is supported by a team of specialists with product and services expertise. For other
customers and for consumers, our businesses collaborate to manage relationships with commercial resellers
targeting SMBs where appropriate.

Manufacturing and Materials

We utilize a significant number of outsourced manufacturers around the world to manufacture products

that we design. The use of outsourced manufacturers is intended to generate cost efficiencies and reduce time
to market for our products as well as maintain flexibility in our supply chain and manufacturing processes. In
some circumstances, third-party OEMs produce products that we purchase and resell under our brand. In
addition to our use of outsourced manufacturers, we currently manufacture a limited number of finished
products from components and subassemblies that we acquire from a wide range of vendors. To generate
further cost efficiencies, through our HPE Next initiative, we will reduce the number of our manufacturing
locations.

Historically, we have utilized two primary methods of fulfilling demand for products: building products to
order and configuring products to order. We build products to order to maximize manufacturing and logistics
efficiencies by producing high volumes of basic product configurations. Alternatively, configuring products to
order enables units to match a customer’s particular hardware and software customization requirements. To
streamline and simplify our operations and reduce our costs to serve our customers, we will reduce the number
of active configurations through our HPE Next initiative. Our inventory management and distribution practices in
both building products to order and configuring products to order seek to minimize inventory holding periods by
taking delivery of the inventory and manufacturing shortly before the sale or distribution of products to our
customers.

We purchase materials, supplies and product subassemblies from a substantial number of vendors. For

most of our products, we have existing alternate sources of supply or such alternate sources of supply are
readily available. However, we do rely on sole sources for certain customized parts (although some of these
sources have operations in multiple locations in the event of a disruption). We are dependent upon Intel and
AMD as suppliers of x86 processors; however, we believe that disruptions with these suppliers would result in
industry-wide dislocations and therefore would not disproportionately disadvantage us relative to our
competitors.

Like other participants in the IT industry, we ordinarily acquire materials and components through a
combination of blanket and scheduled purchase orders to support our demand requirements for periods
averaging 90 to 120 days. From time to time, we may experience significant price volatility or supply
constraints for certain components that are not available from multiple sources or where our suppliers are
geographically concentrated. When necessary, we are often able to obtain scarce components for somewhat
higher prices on the open market, which may have an impact on our gross margin, but does not generally
disrupt production. We may also acquire component inventory in anticipation of supply constraints, or enter into
longer-term pricing commitments with vendors to improve the priority, price and availability of supply. See ‘‘Risk
Factors—We depend on third-party suppliers, and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage our
suppliers properly.’’

International

Our products and services are available worldwide. We believe geographic diversity allows us to meet

demand on a worldwide basis for our customers, draws on business and technical expertise from a worldwide
workforce, provides stability to our operations, provides revenue streams that may offset geographic economic
trends, and offers us an opportunity to access new markets for maturing products.

A summary of our domestic and international results is set forth in Note 3, ‘‘Segment Information’’, to our

Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II. Approximately 66% of our overall net
revenue in fiscal 2017 came from outside the United States.

For a discussion of certain risks attendant to our international operations, see ‘‘Risk Factors—Due to the

international nature of our business, political or economic changes or other factors could harm our future
revenue, costs and expenses, and financial condition,’’ and ‘‘—We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign
currency exchange rates’’ in Item 1A, ‘‘Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk’’ in Item 7A
and Note 14, ‘‘Financial Instruments’’, to our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in Item 8 of
Part II, which are incorporated herein by reference.

HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE

Research and Development

Innovation is a key element of our culture and critical to our success. Our research and development
efforts are focused on designing and developing products, services and solutions that anticipate customers’
changing needs and desires and emerging technological trends. Our efforts also are focused on identifying the
areas where we believe we can make a unique contribution and where partnering with other leading technology
companies will leverage our cost structure and maximize our customers’ experiences.

Expenditures for research and development were $1.5 billion in fiscal 2017, $1.7 billion in fiscal 2016 and

$1.7 billion in fiscal 2015. We anticipate that we will continue to have significant research and development
expenditures in the future to support the design and development of innovative, high-quality products, services
and solutions to maintain and enhance our competitive position. For a discussion of risks attendant to our
research and development activities, see ‘‘Risk Factors—If we cannot successfully execute our go-to-market
strategy and continue to develop, manufacture and market innovative products, services and solutions, our
business and financial performance may suffer’’ in Item 1A.

Patents

Our general policy is to seek patent protection for those inventions likely to be incorporated into our
products and services or where obtaining such proprietary rights will improve our competitive position. At
present, our worldwide patent portfolio includes approximately 11,000 patents.

Patents generally have a term of up to 20 years from the date they are filed. As our patent portfolio has
been built over time, the remaining terms of the individual patents across our patent portfolio vary. We believe
that our patents and patent applications are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our
products and services, enhancing our freedom of action to sell our products and services in markets in which
we choose to participate, and maximizing our return on research and development investments. No single
patent is in itself essential to our company as a whole or to any of our business segments.

In addition to developing our patent portfolio, we license intellectual property from third parties as we

deem appropriate. We have also granted and continue to grant to others licenses and other rights under our
patents when we consider these arrangements to be in our interest. These license arrangements include a
number of cross-licenses with third parties.

For a discussion of risks attendant to intellectual property rights, see ‘‘Risk Factors—Our financial

performance may suffer if we cannot continue to develop, license or enforce the intellectual property rights on
which our businesses depend’’ and ‘‘—Our products and services depend in part on intellectual property and
technology licensed from third parties’’ in Item 1A.

Backlog

We believe that our backlog is not a meaningful indicator of our future business prospects due to our

diverse product and service portfolio, including the large volume of products delivered from finished goods or
channel partner inventories and the shortening of product life cycles. Therefore, we believe that backlog
information is not material to an understanding of our overall business.

Seasonality

General economic conditions have an impact on our business and financial results. From time to time, the

markets in which we sell our products, services and solutions experience weak economic conditions that may
negatively affect sales. We experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products and services. For
example, European sales are often weaker in the summer months. See Item 1A, ‘‘Risk Factors—Our uneven
sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable.’’

Competition

We have a broad technology portfolio of enterprise IT infrastructure products, solutions and services. We

encounter strong competition in all areas of our business. We compete primarily on the basis of technology,
innovation, performance, price, quality, reliability, brand, reputation, distribution, range of products and services,
ease of use of our products, account relationships, customer training, service and support, security, and the
availability of our IT infrastructure offerings.

The markets in which we compete are characterized by strong competition among major corporations with

long-established positions and a large number of new and rapidly growing firms. Most product life cycles are
relatively short, and to remain competitive we must develop new products and services, periodically enhance
our existing products and services and compete effectively on the basis of the factors listed above, among
others. In addition, we compete with many of our current and potential partners, including OEMs that design,
manufacture and market their products under their own brand names. Our successful management of these
competitive partner relationships is critical to our future success. Moreover, we anticipate that we will have to
continue to adjust prices on many of our products and services to stay competitive.

The competitive environments in which each segment operates are described below:

Enterprise Group. EG operates in the highly competitive enterprise technology infrastructure market,

which is characterized by rapid and ongoing technological innovation and price competition. Our primary
competitors include technology vendors such as Dell Technologies Inc., Cisco Systems, Inc., NetApp, Inc.,
Lenovo Group Ltd., International Business Machines Corporation, Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd.,
Amazon.com, Inc., Oracle Corporation, Fujitsu Limited, Juniper Networks, Inc., Inspur Co., Ltd., Hitachi Ltd.,
Extreme Networks, Inc., Pure Storage, Inc., VMware, Nutanix, Inc., Google Inc., and Rackspace Inc. In certain
regions, we also experience competition from local companies and from generically branded or ‘‘white-box’’
manufacturers. Our strategy is to deliver superior products, high-value technology support services and
differentiated integrated solutions that combine our infrastructure, software and services capabilities. Our
competitive advantages include our broad end-to-end solutions portfolio, supported by our strong intellectual
property portfolio and research and development capabilities, coupled with our global reach and partner
ecosystem.

Financial Services.

In our financing business, our competitors are captive financing companies, mainly
IBM Global Financing, as well as banks and other financial institutions. We believe our competitive advantage
over banks and other financial institutions in our financing business is our ability to deliver flexible investment
solutions and expertise that help customers and other partners create unique technology deployments based
on specific business needs.

For a discussion of certain risks attendant to these competitive environments, see ‘‘Risk Factors—We

operate in an intensely competitive industry and competitive pressures could harm our business and financial
performance’’ in Item 1A.

Environment

Our operations are subject to regulation under various federal, state, local, and foreign laws concerning

the environment, including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management
and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the clean-up of contaminated sites. We could incur
substantial costs, including clean-up costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions and third-party damage or
personal injury claims, if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws.

Many of our products are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws governing chemical
substances in products and their safe use, including laws restricting the presence of certain substances in
electronics products and in some cases, laws regulating the manufacture and distribution of chemical
substances. Some of our products and services also are, or may in the future be, subject to requirements
applicable to their energy consumption. In addition, we face increasing complexity in our product design and
procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the chemical and materials
composition of our products, their safe use and their energy efficiency, including requirements relating to
climate change. We are also subject to legislation in an increasing number of jurisdictions that makes

HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE

producers of electrical goods, including servers and networking equipment, financially responsible for specified
collection, recycling, treatment, and disposal of past and future covered products (sometimes referred to as
‘‘product take-back legislation’’). In the event our products become non-compliant with these laws, our products
could be restricted from entering certain jurisdictions and we could face other sanctions, including fines.

Our operations, services and ultimately our products are expected to become increasingly subject to

federal, state, local, and foreign laws, regulations and international treaties relating to climate change. As these
laws, regulations, treaties, and similar initiatives and programs are adopted and implemented throughout the
world, we will be required to comply or potentially face market access limitations or other sanctions, including
fines. However, we believe that technology will be fundamental to finding solutions to achieve compliance with
and manage those requirements, and we are collaborating with industry, business groups and governments to
find and promote ways that our technology can be used to address climate change and to facilitate compliance
with related laws, regulations and treaties.

We are committed to maintaining compliance with all environmental laws applicable to our operations,

products and services, and to reducing our environmental impact across all aspects of our business. We meet
this commitment with a comprehensive environmental, health and safety policy, strict environmental
management of our operations and worldwide environmental programs and services.

Environmental costs and accruals are presently not material to our operations, cash flows or financial

position. Although there is no assurance that existing or future environmental laws applicable to our operations,
services or products will not have a material adverse effect on our operations, cash flows or financial condition,
we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities.

Employees

We had approximately 66,000 employees as of October 31, 2017.

ITEM 1A. Risk Factors.

You should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this Form 10-K in evaluating
Hewlett Packard Enterprise and its common stock. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely
affect our results of operations or financial condition. The following risk factors should be read in conjunction
with Part II, Item 7, ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation’’
and the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8, ‘‘Financial
Statements and Supplemental Data’’ of this Form 10-K.

Risks Related to Our Business

If we cannot successfully execute our go-to-market strategy and continue to develop, manufacture and
market innovative products, services and solutions, our business and financial performance may suffer.

Our long-term strategy is focused on leveraging our existing portfolio of hardware, software and services

as we deliver Hybrid IT solutions to our customers and power the intelligent edge that runs campus, branch
and Internet of Things applications. To successfully execute this strategy, we must address business model
shifts and optimize go-to-market execution by improving cost structure, aligning sales coverage with strategic
goals, improving channel execution and strengthening our capabilities in our areas of strategic focus, while
continuing to pursue new product innovation that builds on our strategic capabilities in areas such as cloud and
data center computing, software-defined networking, converged storage, high-performance compute, and
wireless networking. Any failure to successfully execute this strategy, including any failure to invest sufficiently
in strategic growth areas, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

The process of developing new high-technology products, software, services and solutions and enhancing

existing hardware and software products, services and solutions is complex, costly and uncertain, and any
failure by us to anticipate customers’ changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could
significantly harm our market share, results of operations and financial condition. For example, as the transition
to an environment characterized by cloud-based computing and software being delivered as a service
progresses, we must continue to successfully develop and deploy cloud-based solutions for our customers. We
must make long-term investments, develop or obtain and protect appropriate intellectual property, and commit
significant research and development and other resources before knowing whether our predictions will
accurately reflect customer demand for our products, services and solutions. Any failure to accurately predict
technological and business trends, control research and development costs or execute our innovation strategy
could harm our business and financial performance. Our research and development initiatives may not be
successful in whole or in part, including research and development projects which we have prioritized with
respect to funding and/or personnel.

After we develop a product, we must be able to manufacture appropriate volumes quickly while also

managing costs and preserving margins. To accomplish this, we must accurately forecast volumes, mixes of
products and configurations that meet customer requirements, and we may not succeed at doing so within a
given product’s life cycle or at all. Any delay in the development, production or marketing of a new product,
service or solution could result in us not being among the first to market, which could further harm our
competitive position.

We operate in an intensely competitive industry and competitive pressures could harm our business
and financial performance.

We encounter aggressive competition from numerous and varied competitors in all areas of our business,

and our competitors have targeted and are expected to continue targeting our key market segments. We
compete primarily on the basis of our technology, innovation, performance, price, quality, reliability, brand,
reputation, distribution, range of products and services, ease of use of our products, account relationships,
customer training, service and support, security, and the availability of our offerings. If our products, services,
support and cost structure do not enable us to compete successfully based on any of those criteria, our results
of operations and business prospects could be harmed.

We have a large portfolio of products and services and must allocate our financial, personnel and other

resources across all of our products and services while competing with companies that have smaller portfolios
or specialize in one or more of our product or service lines. As a result, we may invest less in certain areas of

|12

10-K

12

HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE

our business than our competitors do, and our competitors may have greater financial, technical and marketing
resources available to them compared to the resources allocated to our products and services that compete
against their products and services. Industry consolidation may also affect competition by creating larger, more
homogeneous and potentially stronger competitors in the markets in which we operate. Additionally, our
competitors may affect our business by entering into exclusive arrangements with our existing or potential
customers or suppliers.

Companies with whom we have alliances in certain areas may be or become our competitors in other

areas. In addition, companies with whom we have alliances also may acquire or form alliances with our
competitors, which could reduce their business with us. If we are unable to effectively manage these
complicated relationships with alliance partners, our business and results of operations could be adversely
affected.

We face aggressive price competition and may have to continue lowering the prices of many of our

products and services to stay competitive, while simultaneously seeking to maintain or improve our revenue
and gross margin. In addition, competitors who have a greater presence in some of the lower-cost markets in
which we compete, or who can obtain better pricing, more favorable contractual terms and conditions or more
favorable allocations of products and components during periods of limited supply may be able to offer lower
prices than we are able to offer. Our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely
affected by these and other industry-wide pricing pressures.

Because our business model is based on providing innovative and high-quality products, we may spend a
proportionately greater amount of our revenues on research and development than some of our competitors. If
we cannot proportionately decrease our cost structure (apart from research and development expenses) on a
timely basis in response to competitive price pressures, our gross margin and, therefore, our profitability could
be adversely affected. In addition, if our pricing and other facets of our offerings are not sufficiently competitive,
or if there is an adverse reaction to our product decisions, we may lose market share in certain areas, which
could adversely affect our financial performance and business prospects.

Even if we are able to maintain or increase market share for a particular product, its financial performance

could decline because the product is in a maturing industry or market segment or contains technology that is
becoming obsolete. For example, our Storage business unit is experiencing the effects of a market transition
towards converged products and solutions, which has led to a decline in demand for our traditional storage
products. Financial performance could decline due to increased competition from other types of products. For
example, the development of cloud-based solutions has reduced demand for some of our existing hardware
products.

If we cannot continue to produce quality products and services, our reputation, business and financial
performance may suffer.

In the course of conducting our business, we must adequately address quality issues associated with our
products, services and solutions, including defects in our engineering, design and manufacturing processes and
unsatisfactory performance under service contracts, as well as defects in third-party components included in
our products and unsatisfactory performance or even malicious acts by third-party contractors or subcontractors
or their employees. In order to address quality issues, we work extensively with our customers and suppliers
and engage in product testing to determine the causes of problems and to develop and implement appropriate
solutions. However, the products, services and solutions that we offer are complex, and our regular testing and
quality control efforts may not be effective in controlling or detecting all quality issues or errors, particularly with
respect to faulty components manufactured by third parties. If we are unable to determine the cause, find an
appropriate solution or offer a temporary fix (or ‘‘patch’’) to address quality issues with our products, we may
delay shipment to customers, which could delay revenue recognition and receipt of customer payments and
could adversely affect our revenue, cash flows and profitability. In addition, after products are delivered, quality
issues may require us to repair or replace such products. Addressing quality issues can be expensive and may
result in additional warranty, repair, replacement and other costs, adversely affecting our financial performance.
If new or existing customers have difficulty operating our products or are dissatisfied with our services or
solutions, our results of operations could be adversely affected, and we could face possible claims if we fail to
meet our customers’ expectations. In addition, quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing

HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE

13

10-K 13

|

customers and adversely affect our brand and reputation, which could, in turn, adversely affect our results of
operations.

If we fail to manage the distribution of our products and services properly, our business and financial
performance could suffer.

We use a variety of distribution methods to sell our products and services around the world, including

third-party resellers and distributors and both direct and indirect sales to enterprise accounts and consumers.
Successfully managing the interaction of our direct and indirect channel efforts to reach various potential
customer segments for our products and services is a complex process. Moreover, since each distribution
method has distinct risks and gross margins, our failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the
delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenue and gross margins and
therefore our profitability.

Our financial results could be materially adversely affected due to distribution channel conflicts or if the

financial conditions of our channel partners were to weaken. Our results of operations may be adversely
affected by any conflicts that might arise between our various distribution channels or the loss or deterioration
of any alliance or distribution arrangement. Moreover, some of our wholesale distributors may have insufficient
financial resources and may not be able to withstand changes in business conditions, including economic
weakness, industry consolidation and market trends. Many of our significant distributors operate on narrow
margins and have been negatively affected by business pressures in the past. Considerable trade receivables
that are not covered by collateral or credit insurance are outstanding with our distribution channel partners.
Revenue from indirect sales could suffer, and we could experience disruptions in distribution, if our distributors’
financial conditions, abilities to borrow funds in the credit markets or operations weaken.

Our inventory management is complex, as we continue to sell a significant mix of products through

distributors. We must manage both owned and channel inventory effectively, particularly with respect to sales
to distributors, which involves forecasting demand and pricing challenges. Distributors may increase orders
during periods of product shortages, cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of
new products. Distributors also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the
products of our competitors and seasonal fluctuations in end-user demand. Our reliance upon indirect
distribution methods may reduce our visibility into demand and pricing trends and issues, and therefore make
forecasting more difficult. If we have excess or obsolete inventory, we may have to reduce our prices and write
down inventory. Moreover, our use of indirect distribution channels may limit our willingness or ability to adjust
prices quickly and otherwise to respond to pricing changes by competitors. We also may have limited ability to
estimate future product rebate redemptions in order to price our products effectively.

Due to the international nature of our business, political or economic changes or other factors could
harm our future revenue, costs and expenses, and financial condition.

Our business and financial performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions and the

demand for technology hardware, software and services in the markets in which we compete. Economic
weakness and uncertainty may adversely affect demand for our products, services and solutions, may result in
increased expenses due to higher allowances for doubtful accounts and potential goodwill and asset
impairment charges, and may make it more difficult for us to manage inventory and make accurate forecasts of
revenue, gross margin, cash flows and expenses.

Economic weakness and uncertainty could cause our expenses to vary materially from our expectations.

Any financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets or any significant financial services
institution failures could negatively impact our treasury operations, as the financial condition of such parties
may deteriorate rapidly and without notice in times of market volatility and disruption. Poor financial
performance of asset markets combined with lower interest rates and the adverse effects of fluctuating
currency exchange rates could lead to higher pension and post-retirement benefit expenses. Interest and other
expenses could vary materially from expectations depending on changes in interest rates, borrowing costs,
currency exchange rates, costs of hedging activities and the fair value of derivative instruments. Economic
downturns also may lead to restructuring actions and associated expenses. Further, ongoing U.S. federal
government spending limits may limit demand for our products, services and solutions from organizations that

|14

10-K

14

HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE

receive funding from the U.S. government, and could negatively affect macroeconomic conditions in the United
States, which could further reduce demand for our products, services and solutions.

Sales outside the United States constituted approximately 66% of our net revenue in fiscal 2017. Our

future business and financial performance could suffer due to a variety of international factors, including:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

ongoing instability or changes in a country’s or region’s economic or political conditions, including
inflation, recession, interest rate fluctuations and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts,
including uncertainties and instability in economic and market conditions caused by the United
Kingdom’s vote to exit the European Union;

longer collection cycles and financial instability among customers;

trade regulations and procedures and actions affecting production, pricing and marketing of products,
including policies adopted by countries that may champion or otherwise favor domestic companies
and technologies over foreign competitors, or federal and state tax reforms;

local labor conditions and regulations, including local labor issues faced by specific suppliers and
original equipment manufacturers (‘‘OEMs’’), or changes to immigration and labor law policies which
may adversely impact our access to technical and professional talent;

managing our geographically dispersed workforce;

changes in the international, national or local regulatory and legal environments;

differing technology standards or customer requirements;

import, export or other business licensing requirements or requirements relating to making foreign
direct investments, which could increase our cost of doing business in certain jurisdictions, prevent
us from shipping products to particular countries or markets, affect our ability to obtain favorable
terms for components, increase our operating costs or lead to penalties or restrictions;

difficulties associated with repatriating earnings generated or held abroad in a tax-efficient manner,
and changes in tax laws; and

fluctuations in freight costs, limitations on shipping and receiving capacity, and other disruptions in
the transportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for our
products and shipments.

The factors described above also could disrupt our product and component manufacturing and key

suppliers located outside of the United States. For example, we rely on suppliers in Asia for product assembly
and manufacture.

In many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, there are companies that

engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the ‘‘FCPA’’). Although we implement policies, procedures and training
designed to facilitate compliance with these laws, our employees, contractors and agents, as well as those of
the companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, may take actions in violation of our
policies. Any such violation, even if prohibited by our policies, could have an adverse effect on our business
and reputation.

We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

Currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the euro, the British pound, Chinese yuan (renminbi) and

the Japanese yen, can have an impact on our results as expressed in U.S. dollars. Currency volatility
contributes to variations in our sales of products and services in impacted jurisdictions. Fluctuations in foreign
currency exchange rates, most notably the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro, could adversely
affect our revenue growth in future periods. In addition, currency variations can adversely affect margins on
sales of our products in countries outside of the United States and margins on sales of products that include
components obtained from suppliers located outside of the United States.

From time to time, we may use forward contracts and options designated as cash flow hedges to protect

against foreign currency exchange rate risks. The effectiveness of our hedges depends on our ability to

HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE

15

10-K 15

|

accurately forecast future cash flows, which is particularly difficult during periods of uncertain demand for our
products and services and highly volatile exchange rates. We may incur significant losses from our hedging
activities due to factors such as demand volatility and currency variations. In addition, certain or all of our
hedging activities may be ineffective, may expire and not be renewed or may not offset any or more than a
portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations. Losses associated with hedging
activities also may impact our revenue and to a lesser extent our cost of sales and financial condition.

The revenue and profitability of our operations have historically varied, which makes our future
financial results less predictable.

Our revenue, gross margin and profit vary among our diverse products and services, customer groups
and geographic markets and therefore will likely be different in future periods than our historical results. Our
revenue depends on the overall demand for our products and services. Delays or reductions in IT spending by
our customers or potential customers could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and
services, which could result in a significant decline in revenue. In addition, revenue declines in some of our
businesses, may affect revenue in our other businesses as we may lose cross-selling opportunities. Overall
gross margins and profitability in any given period are dependent partially on the product, service, customer
and geographic mix reflected in that period’s net revenue. Competition, lawsuits, investigations, increases in
component and manufacturing costs that we are unable to pass on to our customers, component supply
disruptions and other risks affecting those businesses therefore may have a significant impact on our overall
gross margin and profitability. Variations in fixed cost structure and gross margins across business units and
product portfolios may lead to significant operating profit volatility on a quarterly or annual basis. In addition,
newer geographic markets may be relatively less profitable due to our investments associated with entering
those markets and local pricing pressures, and we may have difficulty establishing and maintaining the
operating infrastructure necessary to support the high growth rate associated with some of those markets.
Market trends, industry shifts, competitive pressures, commoditization of products, increased component or
shipping costs, regulatory impacts and other factors may result in reductions in revenue or pressure on gross
margins of certain segments in a given period, which may lead to adjustments to our operations. Moreover, our
efforts to address the challenges facing our business could increase the level of variability in our financial
results because the rate at which we are able to realize the benefits from those efforts may vary from period to
period

We depend on third-party suppliers, and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage our
suppliers properly.

Our operations depend on our ability to anticipate our needs for components, products and services, as

well as our suppliers’ ability to deliver sufficient quantities of quality components, products and services at
reasonable prices and in time for us to meet critical schedules for the delivery of our own products and
services. Given the wide variety of systems, products and services that we offer, the large number of our
suppliers and contract manufacturers that are located around the world, and the long lead times required to
manufacture, assemble and deliver certain components and products, problems could arise in production,
planning and inventory management that could seriously harm our business. In addition, our ongoing efforts to
optimize the efficiency of our supply chain could cause supply disruptions and be more expensive,
time-consuming and resource-intensive than expected. Furthermore, certain of our suppliers may decide to
discontinue conducting business with us. Other supplier problems that we could face include component
shortages, excess supply, risks related to the terms of our contracts with suppliers, risks associated with
contingent workers, and risks related to our relationships with single-source suppliers, each of which is
described below.

•

Component shortages. We may experience a shortage of, or a delay in receiving, certain
components as a result of strong demand, capacity constraints, supplier financial weaknesses, the
inability of suppliers to borrow funds in the credit markets, disputes with suppliers (some of whom
are also our customers), disruptions in the operations of component suppliers, other problems
experienced by suppliers or problems faced during the transition to new suppliers. If shortages or
delays persist, the price of certain components (such as dynamic random-access memory (‘‘DRAM’’)
which increased in price significantly during fiscal 2017) may increase, we may be exposed to quality
issues, or the components may not be available at all. We may not be able to secure enough
components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build products or provide services in a

•

timely manner in the quantities needed or according to our specifications. Accordingly, our business
and financial performance could suffer if we lose time-sensitive sales, incur additional freight costs or
are unable to pass on price increases to our customers. If we cannot adequately address supply
issues, we might have to reengineer some product or service offerings, which could result in further
costs and delays.

Excess supply. In order to secure components for our products or services, at times we may make
advance payments to suppliers or enter into non-cancelable commitments with vendors. In addition,
we may purchase components strategically in advance of demand to take advantage of favorable
pricing or to address concerns about the availability of future components. If we fail to anticipate
customer demand properly, a temporary oversupply could result in excess or obsolete components,
which could adversely affect our business and financial performance.

Contractual terms. As a result of binding long-term price or purchase commitments with vendors, we
may be obligated to purchase components or services at prices that are higher than those available
in the current market and be limited in our ability to respond to changing market conditions. If we
commit to purchasing components or services for prices in excess of the then-current market price,
we may be at a disadvantage to competitors who have access to components or services at lower
prices, our gross margin could suffer, and we could incur additional charges relating to inventory
obsolescence. Any of these developments could adversely affect our future results of operations and
financial condition.

Contingent workers. We also rely on third-party suppliers for the provision of contingent workers,
and our failure to manage our use of such workers effectively could adversely affect our results of
operations. We have been exposed to various legal claims relating to the status of contingent
workers in the past and could face similar claims in the future. We may be subject to shortages,
oversupply or fixed contractual terms relating to contingent workers. Our ability to manage the size
of, and costs associated with, the contingent workforce may be subject to additional constraints
imposed by local laws.

Single-source suppliers. We obtain a significant number of components from single sources due to
technology, availability, price, quality or other considerations. New products that we introduce may
utilize custom components obtained from only one source initially until we have evaluated whether
there is a need for additional suppliers. Replacing a single-source supplier could delay production of
some products as replacement suppliers may be subject to capacity constraints or other output
limitations. For some components, such as customized components, alternative sources either may
not exist or may be unable to produce the quantities of those components necessary to satisfy our
production requirements. In addition, we sometimes purchase components from single-source
suppliers under short-term agreements that contain favorable pricing and other terms but that may
be unilaterally modified or terminated by the supplier with limited notice and with little or no penalty.
The performance of such single-source suppliers under those agreements (and the renewal or
extension of those agreements upon similar terms) may affect the quality, quantity and price of our
components. The loss of a single-source supplier, the deterioration of our relationship with a
single-source supplier or any unilateral modification to the contractual terms under which we are
supplied components by a single-source supplier could adversely affect our business and financial
performance.

Business disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our
costs and expenses.

Our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes, telecommunications failures, power or water

shortages, tsunamis, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics or
pandemics and other natural or manmade disasters or catastrophic events, for which we are predominantly
self-insured. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could result in significant losses, seriously
harm our revenue, profitability and financial condition, adversely affect our competitive position, increase our
costs and expenses, and require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume
operations. Our corporate headquarters and a portion of our research and development activities are located in
California, and other critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in California and Asia,
near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity. In addition, our principal worldwide IT data centers are
located in the southern United States, making our operations more vulnerable to natural disasters or other

HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE

|

business disruptions occurring in that geographical area, such as 2017 hurricane Harvey, which caused severe
damage in Houston. The manufacture of product components, the final assembly of our products and other
critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations, including the Czech Republic, Mexico,
China and Singapore. We also rely on major logistics hubs, primarily in Asia to manufacture and distribute our
products, and primarily in the southwestern United States to import products into the Americas region. Our
operations could be adversely affected if manufacturing, logistics or other operations in these locations are
disrupted for any reason, including natural disasters, IT system failures, military actions or economic, business,
labor, environmental, public health, regulatory or political issues. The ultimate impact on us, our significant
suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near locations more vulnerable to the occurrence of
the aforementioned business disruptions, such as near major earthquake faults, and being consolidated in
certain geographical areas is unknown and remains uncertain.

Our uneven sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results
less predictable.

In some of our businesses, our quarterly sales have periodically reflected a pattern in which a

disproportionate percentage of each quarter’s total sales occurs towards the end of the quarter. This uneven
sales pattern makes predicting revenue, earnings, cash flow from operations and working capital for each
financial period difficult, increases the risk of unanticipated variations in our quarterly results and financial
condition and places pressure on our inventory management and logistics systems. If predicted demand is
substantially greater than orders, there may be excess inventory. Alternatively, if orders substantially exceed
predicted demand, we may not be able to fulfill all of the orders received in each quarter and such orders may
be cancelled. Depending on when they occur in a quarter, developments such as a systems failure, component
pricing movements, component shortages or global logistics disruptions, could adversely impact our inventory
levels and results of operations in a manner that is disproportionate to the number of days in the quarter
affected.

We experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products that also may produce variations in our

quarterly results and financial condition. For example, sales to governments (particularly sales to the U.S.
government) are often stronger in the third calendar quarter, and many customers whose fiscal year is the
calendar year spend their remaining capital budget authorizations in the fourth calendar quarter prior to new
budget constraints in the first calendar quarter of the following year. European sales are often weaker during
the summer months. Typically, our third fiscal quarter is our weakest and our fourth fiscal quarter is our
strongest. Many of the factors that create and affect seasonal trends are beyond our control.

Any failure by us to identify, manage and complete acquisitions, divestitures and other significant
transactions successfully could harm our financial results, business and prospects.

As part of our business strategy, we may acquire companies or businesses, divest businesses or assets,

enter into strategic alliances and joint ventures and make investments to further our business (collectively,
‘‘business combination and investment transactions’’). For example, in May 2015, we acquired Aruba
Networks, Inc., which provides next-generation network access solutions for mobile enterprise. In May 2016,
we completed the sale to Tsinghua Holdings Co., Ltd. (‘‘Tsinghua’’), the asset management arm of Tsinghua
University in China, of a 51% interest in our wholly owned subsidiary that owns and operates H3C
Technologies and our China-based server, storage and technology services businesses for approximately
$2.6 billion. On April 1, 2017 and September 1, 2017, we spun off our Enterprise Services and Software
businesses, respectively. See also the risk factors below under the heading ‘‘Risks Related to the Separations
of our Former Enterprise Services Business and our Former Software Segment’’

Risks associated with business combination and investment transactions include the following, any of

which could adversely affect our revenue, gross margin, profitability and financial results:

•

•

Managing business combination and investment transactions requires varying levels of management
resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations.

We may not fully realize all of the anticipated benefits of any particular business combination and
investment transaction, and the timeframe for realizing the benefits of a particular business
combination and investment transaction may depend partially upon the actions of employees,
advisors, suppliers, other third parties or market trends.

Certain previous business combination and investment transactions have resulted, and in the future
any such transactions by us may result, in significant costs and expenses, including those related to
severance pay, early retirement costs, employee benefit costs, charges from the elimination of
duplicative facilities and contracts, inventory adjustments, assumed litigation and other liabilities,
legal, accounting and financial advisory fees, and required payments to executive officers and key
employees under retention plans.

Any increased or unexpected costs, unanticipated delays or failure to meet contractual obligations
could make business combination and investment transactions less profitable or unprofitable.

Our ability to conduct due diligence with respect to business combination and investment
transactions, and our ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence, is dependent upon the
veracity and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by third parties or
their representatives.

Our due diligence process may fail to identify significant issues with the acquired company’s product
quality, financial disclosures, accounting practices or internal control deficiencies.

The pricing and other terms of our contracts for business combination and investment transactions
require us to make estimates and assumptions at the time we enter into these contracts, and, during
the course of our due diligence, we may not identify all of the factors necessary to estimate
accurately our costs, timing and other matters or we may incur costs if a business combination is not
consummated.

In order to complete a business combination and investment transaction, we may issue common
stock, potentially creating dilution for our existing stockholders.

We may borrow to finance business combination and investment transactions, and the amount and
terms of any potential future acquisition-related or other borrowings, as well as other factors, could
affect our liquidity and financial condition.

Our effective tax rate on an ongoing basis is uncertain, and business combination and investment
transactions could adversely impact our effective tax rate.

An announced business combination and investment transaction may not close on the expected
timeframe or at all, which may cause our financial results to differ from expectations in a given
quarter.

Business combination and investment transactions may lead to litigation, which could impact our
financial condition and results of operations.

If we fail to identify and successfully complete and integrate business combination and investment
transactions that further our strategic objectives, we may be required to expend resources to develop
products, services and technology internally, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage.

We have incurred and will incur additional depreciation and amortization expense over the useful lives of
certain assets acquired in connection with business combination and investment transactions and, to the extent
that the value of goodwill or intangible assets acquired in connection with a business combination and
investment transaction becomes impaired, we may be required to incur additional material charges relating to
the impairment of those assets.

As part of our business strategy, we regularly evaluate the potential disposition of assets and businesses

that may no longer help us meet our objectives. When we decide to sell assets or a business, we may
encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner, which
could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives. We may also dispose of a business at a price or on
terms that are less desirable than we had anticipated. In addition, we may experience greater dis-synergies
than expected, and the impact of the divestiture on our revenue growth may be larger than projected. After
reaching an agreement with a buyer or seller for the acquisition or disposition of a business, we are subject to
satisfaction of pre-closing conditions as well as to necessary regulatory and governmental approvals on
acceptable terms, which, if not satisfied or obtained, may prevent us from completing the transaction.
Dispositions may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested business, such as through
continuing equity ownership, guarantees, indemnities or other financial obligations. Under these arrangements,

HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE

performance by the divested businesses or other conditions outside of our control could affect our future
financial results.

Integrating acquisitions may be difficult and time-consuming. Any failure by us to integrate acquired
companies, products or services into our overall business in a timely manner could harm our financial
results, business and prospects.

In order to pursue our strategy successfully, we must identify candidates for and successfully complete

business combination and investment transactions, some of which may be large or complex, and manage
post-closing issues such as the integration of acquired businesses, products, services or employees.
Integration issues are often time-consuming and expensive and, without proper planning and implementation,
could significantly disrupt our business and the acquired business. The challenges involved in integration
include:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

successfully combining product and service offerings, including under the single new Hewlett
Packard Enterprise brand, and entering or expanding into markets in which we are not experienced
or are developing expertise;

convincing customers and distributors that the transaction will not diminish customer service
standards or business focus;

persuading customers and distributors to not defer purchasing decisions or switch to other suppliers
(which could result in our incurring additional obligations in order to address customer uncertainty),
minimizing sales force attrition and expanding and coordinating sales, marketing and distribution
efforts;

consolidating and rationalizing corporate IT infrastructure, which may include multiple legacy systems
from various acquisitions and integrating software code and business processes;

minimizing the diversion of management attention from ongoing business concerns;

persuading employees that business cultures are compatible, maintaining employee morale and
retaining key employees, engaging with employee works councils representing an acquired
company’s non-U.S. employees, integrating employees, correctly estimating employee benefit costs
and implementing restructuring programs;

coordinating and combining administrative, manufacturing, research and development and other
operations, subsidiaries, facilities and relationships with third parties in accordance with local laws
and other obligations while maintaining adequate standards, controls and procedures;

achieving savings from supply chain integration; and

managing integration issues shortly after or pending the completion of other independent
transactions.

We may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our restructuring plans and our
restructuring may adversely affect our business.

We have announced restructuring plans, including the 2012 Plan and the 2015 Plan (each as defined
below), and the HPE Next initiative, in order to realign our cost structure due to the changing nature of our
business and to achieve operating efficiencies that we expect to reduce costs, as well as simplify our
organizational structure, upgrade our IT infrastructure and redesign business processes. We may not be able to
obtain the cost savings and benefits that were initially anticipated in connection with our restructuring.
Additionally, as a result of restructuring initiatives, we may experience a loss of continuity, loss of accumulated
knowledge and/or inefficiency during transitional periods. Reorganization and restructuring can require a
significant amount of management and other employees’ time and focus, which may divert attention from
operating and growing our business. If we fail to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of restructuring, it
could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows. For more information about our restructuring plans, including details regarding the
2012 Plan and the 2015 Plan, and the HPE Next initiative, see Note 4, ‘‘Restructuring’’, and Note 5, ‘‘HPE
Next’’, to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements.

Our financial performance may suffer if we cannot continue to develop, license or enforce the
intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend.

We rely upon patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property laws in the United

States, similar laws in other countries, and agreements with our employees, customers, suppliers and other
parties, to establish and maintain intellectual property rights in the products and services we sell, provide or
otherwise use in our operations. However, any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged,
invalidated, infringed or circumvented, or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit us to
take advantage of current market trends or to otherwise provide competitive advantages, either of which could
result in costly product redesign efforts, discontinuance of certain product offerings or other harm to our
competitive position. Further, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent
as the laws of the United States. Therefore, in certain jurisdictions we may be unable to protect our proprietary
technology adequately against unauthorized third-party copying or use; this, too, could adversely affect our
ability to sell products or services and our competitive position.

Our products and services depend in part on intellectual property and technology licensed from third
parties.

Much of our business and many of our products rely on key technologies developed or licensed by third

parties. For example, many of our software offerings are developed using software components or other
intellectual property licensed from third parties, including through both proprietary and open source licenses.
These third-party software components may become obsolete, defective or incompatible with future versions of
our products, or our relationship with the third party may deteriorate, or our agreements with the third party
may expire or be terminated. We may face legal or business disputes with licensors that may threaten or lead
to the disruption of inbound licensing relationships. In order to remain in compliance with the terms of our
licenses, we must carefully monitor and manage our use of third-party software components, including both
proprietary and open source license terms that may require the licensing or public disclosure of our intellectual
property without compensation or on undesirable terms. Additionally, some of these licenses may not be
available to us in the future on terms that are acceptable or that allow our product offerings to remain
competitive. Our inability to obtain licenses or rights on favorable terms could have a material effect on our
business, including our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, it is possible that as a
consequence of a merger or acquisition, third parties may obtain licenses to some of our intellectual property
rights or our business may be subject to certain restrictions that were not in place prior to such transaction.
Because the availability and cost of licenses from third parties depends upon the willingness of third parties to
deal with us on the terms we request, there is a risk that third parties who license to our competitors will either
refuse to license us at all, or refuse to license us on terms equally favorable to those granted to our
competitors. Consequently, we may lose a competitive advantage with respect to these intellectual property
rights or we may be required to enter into costly arrangements in order to terminate or limit these rights.

Third-party claims of intellectual property infringement, including patent infringement, are
commonplace in the IT industry and successful third-party claims may limit or disrupt our ability to sell
our products and services.

Third parties also may claim that we or customers indemnified by us are infringing upon their intellectual

property rights. For example, patent assertion entities may purchase intellectual property assets for the purpose
of asserting claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from companies such as Hewlett
Packard Enterprise and its customers. If we cannot or do not license allegedly infringed intellectual property at
all or on reasonable terms, or if we are required to substitute similar technology from another source, our
operations could be adversely affected. Even if we believe that intellectual property claims are without merit,
they can be time-consuming and costly to defend against and may divert management’s attention and
resources away from our business. Claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to
redesign affected products, enter into costly settlement or license agreements, pay costly damage awards or
face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from importing, marketing or selling certain of our
products. Even if we have an agreement to indemnify us against such costs, the indemnifying party may be
unable or unwilling to uphold its contractual obligations to us.

The allocation of intellectual property rights that was made between Hewlett Packard Enterprise and
HP Inc. as part of the separation of the two entities, and the shared use of certain intellectual property
rights following the Separation, could in the future adversely impact our reputation, our ability to
enforce certain intellectual property rights that are important to us and our competitive position.

In connection with the Separation, HP Co. allocated to each of Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc.

the intellectual property assets relevant to their respective businesses. The terms of the Separation include
cross-licenses and other arrangements to provide for certain ongoing use of intellectual property in the existing
operations of both businesses. For example, through a joint brand holding structure, both Hewlett Packard
Enterprise and HP Inc. retain the ability to make ongoing use of certain variations of the legacy
Hewlett-Packard and HP branding, respectively. As a result of this continuing shared use of the legacy
branding there is a risk that conduct or events adversely affecting the reputation of HP Inc. could also
adversely affect the reputation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise. In addition, as a result of the allocation of
intellectual property as part of the Separation, Hewlett Packard Enterprise no longer has ownership of
intellectual property allocated to HP Inc. and our resulting intellectual property ownership position could
adversely affect our position and options relating to patent enforcement and patent licensing, our ability to sell
our products or services and our competitive position in the industry.

Failure to comply with our customer contracts or government contracting regulations could adversely
affect our business and results of operations.

Our contracts with our customers may include unique and specialized performance requirements. In

particular, our contracts with federal, state, provincial and local governmental customers are subject to various
procurement regulations, contract provisions and other requirements relating to their formation, administration
and performance. Any failure by us to comply with the specific provisions in our customer contracts or any
violation of government contracting regulations could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal
penalties, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments and, in the
case of our government contracts, fines and suspension from future government contracting. Such failures
could also cause reputational damage to our business. In addition, our former Parent has in the past been, and
we may in the future be, subject to qui tam litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the government
relating to our government contracts, which could include claims for treble damages. Further, any negative
publicity related to our customer contracts or any proceedings surrounding them, regardless of its accuracy,
may damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new contracts. If our customer contracts are
terminated, if we are suspended or disbarred from government work, or if our ability to compete for new
contracts is adversely affected, our financial performance could suffer.

We make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of our Consolidated and
Combined Financial Statements and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could adversely
affect our results of operations.

In connection with the preparation of our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements, we use

certain estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and other factors. Our most critical
accounting estimates are described in the section entitled ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations.’’ In addition, as discussed in Note 19, ‘‘Litigation and Contingencies’’, to
our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements, we make certain estimates, including decisions related
to provisions for legal proceedings and other contingencies. While we believe that these estimates and
assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances, they are subject to significant uncertainties, some of
which are beyond our control. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been
incorrect, it could adversely affect our results of operations.

Unanticipated changes in our tax provisions, the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to
additional tax liabilities could affect our financial performance.

We are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our

tax liabilities are affected by the amounts we charge in intercompany transactions for inventory, services,
licenses, funding and other items. We are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities
may disagree with our intercompany charges, cross-jurisdictional transfer pricing or other matters, and may
assess additional taxes as a result. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to

|22

10-K

22

HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE

determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. However, there can be no assurance that we will accurately
predict the outcomes of these audits, and the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be
materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a
material impact on our tax provision, net income and cash flows. In addition, our effective tax rate in the future
could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure, changes in the mix of earnings in countries
with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax
laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process. In particular, if
circumstances change such that we are unable to indefinitely reinvest our foreign earnings outside the United
States, future income tax expense and payments may differ significantly from historical amounts and could
materially adversely affect our results of operations. As of October 31, 2017, we had $12.0 billion of
undistributed earnings from non-U.S. operations indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States. See
Note 8, ‘‘Taxes on Earnings’’, to our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. The carrying value of
our deferred tax assets, which are predominantly in the United States, is dependent on our ability to generate
future taxable income in the United States. In addition, there are proposals for tax legislation that have been
introduced or that are being considered that could have a significant effect on our tax rate, the carrying value of
deferred tax assets, or our deferred tax liabilities. Any of these changes could affect our financial performance.

Potential U.S. tax reform could have a material effect on the taxation of our business. Recently, U.S. tax

reform bills containing a wide variety of potential changes have been passed by each of the U.S. House of
Representatives and the U.S. Senate. Certain changes to U.S. tax laws, specifically U.S. taxation on earnings
from international business operations, the deductibility of certain costs, and the continuance of certain tax
credits, if enacted, may materially impact our effective tax rate and the amount of taxes we pay.

In order to be successful, we must attract, retain, train, motivate, develop and transition key employees,
and failure to do so could seriously harm us.

In order to be successful, we must attract, retain, train, motivate, develop and transition qualified

executives and other key employees, including those in managerial, technical, development, sales, marketing
and IT support positions. Identifying, developing internally or hiring externally, training and retaining qualified
executives, engineers, skilled solutions providers in the IT support business and qualified sales representatives
are critical to our future, and competition for experienced employees in the IT industry can be intense. In order
to attract and retain executives and other key employees in a competitive marketplace, we must provide a
competitive compensation package, including cash- and equity-based compensation. Our equity-based
incentive awards may contain conditions relating to our stock price performance and our long-term financial
performance that make the future value of those awards uncertain. If the anticipated value of such equity-based
incentive awards does not materialize, if our equity-based compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a
valuable benefit, if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive, or if we do not obtain
the stockholder approval needed to continue granting equity-based incentive awards in the amounts we believe
are necessary, our ability to attract, retain, and motivate executives and key employees could be weakened.

Our failure to successfully hire executives and key employees or the loss of any executives and key

employees could have a significant impact on our operations. Further, changes in our management team may
be disruptive to our business, and any failure to successfully transition and assimilate key new hires or
promoted employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations.

System security risks, data protection breaches, cyberattacks and systems integration issues could
disrupt our internal operations or IT services provided to customers, and any such disruption could
reduce our revenue, increase our expenses, damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock
price.

As a leading technology firm we are exposed to attacks from criminals, nation state actors and activist

hackers (collectively, malicious parties) who may be able to circumvent or bypass our cyber security measures
and misappropriate, maliciously alter or destroy our confidential information or that of third parties, create
system disruptions or cause shutdowns. Malicious parties also may be able to develop and deploy viruses,
worms, ransomware and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any
security vulnerabilities of our products. Malicious parties may compromise our manufacturing supply chain to
embed malicious software in our products for use in compromising our customers. In addition, sophisticated
hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may

HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE

23

10-K 23

|

contain defects in design or manufacture, including flaws that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of
the system. The costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems, including bugs, viruses,
worms, malicious software programs and other security vulnerabilities, could be significant, and our efforts to
address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service
and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales, manufacturing, distribution or other
critical functions.

We manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our

business. In addition, our Pointnext services business may processes, store and transmits data relevant to our
clients, including commercially sensitive and personally identifiable information, including the personal
information of European citizens covered by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Breaches of our
cyber or physical security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination
of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us, our clients or our customers, including the
potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud, trickery or other forms of deception,
could expose us, our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result
in litigation and potential liability for us, damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business. We
also could lose existing or potential customers of services or other IT solutions or incur significant expenses in
connection with our customers’ system failures or any actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our
products and services. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data
protection measures could be significant.

Portions of our IT infrastructure also may experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or

produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time. We
may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data, which could cause business
disruptions and be more expensive, time-consuming, disruptive and resource intensive. Such disruptions could
adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and respond to customer requests and interrupt other processes.
Delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers resulting from these disruptions could reduce our revenue,
increase our expenses, damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price.

Terrorist acts, conflicts, wars and geopolitical uncertainties may seriously harm our business and
revenue, costs and expenses and financial condition and stock price.

Terrorist acts, conflicts or wars (wherever located around the world) may cause damage or disruption to

our business, our employees, facilities, partners, suppliers, distributors, resellers or customers or adversely
affect our ability to manage logistics, operate our transportation and communication systems or conduct certain
other critical business operations. The potential for future attacks, the national and international responses to
attacks or perceived threats to national security, and other actual or potential conflicts or wars have created
many economic and political uncertainties. In addition, as a major multinational company with headquarters and
significant operations located in the United States, actions against or by the United States may impact our
business or employees. Although it is impossible to predict the occurrences or consequences of any such
events, if they occur, they could result in a decrease in demand for our products, make it difficult or impossible
to provide services or deliver products to our customers or to receive components from our suppliers, create
delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain and result in the need to impose employee travel restrictions. We
are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts, conflicts and wars.

Our business is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that could
result in costs or other sanctions that adversely affect our business and results of operations.

We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations. For example, we are

subject to laws and regulations concerning environmental protection, including laws addressing the discharge of
pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, the
clean-up of contaminated sites, the content of our products and the recycling, treatment and disposal of our
products. In particular, we face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we
adjust to new and future requirements relating to the chemical and materials composition of our products, their
safe use, the energy consumption associated with those products, climate change laws and regulations and
product take-back legislation. If we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or if our products
become non-compliant with environmental laws, we could incur substantial costs or face other sanctions, which
may include restrictions on our products entering certain jurisdictions. Our potential exposure includes fines and

|24

10-K

24

HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE

civil or criminal sanctions, third-party property damage, personal injury claims and clean-up costs. Further,
liability under some environmental laws relating to contaminated sites can be imposed retroactively, on a joint
and several basis, and without any finding of noncompliance or fault. The amount and timing of costs to comply
with environmental laws are difficult to predict.

In addition, our business is subject to laws addressing privacy and information security. In particular, we
face an increasingly complex regulatory environment as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to
the security of our offerings. If we were to violate or become liable under laws or regulations associated with
security, we could incur substantial costs or face other sanctions. Our potential exposure includes fines and
civil or criminal sanctions, and third-party claims.

Our stock price has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate, which may make future prices of our
stock difficult to predict.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s stock price, like that of other technology companies, can be volatile. Some

of the factors that could affect our stock price are:

•

•

•

•

•

•

speculation, coverage or sentiment in the media or the investment community about, or actual
changes in, our business, strategic position, market share, organizational structure, operations,
financial condition, financial reporting and results, effectiveness of cost-cutting efforts, value or
liquidity of our investments, exposure to market volatility, prospects, business combination or
investment transactions, future stock price performance, board of directors, executive team, our
competitors or our industry in general;

the announcement of new, planned or contemplated products, services, technological innovations,
acquisitions, divestitures or other significant transactions by Hewlett Packard Enterprise or its
competitors;

quarterly increases or decreases in revenue, gross margin, earnings or cash flows, changes in
estimates by the investment community or financial outlook provided by Hewlett Packard Enterprise
and variations between actual and estimated financial results;

announcements of actual and anticipated financial results by Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s
competitors and other companies in the IT industry;

developments relating to pending investigations, claims and disputes; and

the timing and amount of share repurchases by Hewlett Packard Enterprise.

General or industry specific market conditions or stock market performance or domestic or international

macroeconomic and geopolitical factors unrelated to Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s performance also may affect
the price of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s stock. For these reasons, investors should not rely on recent or
historical trends to predict future stock prices, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Volatility
in the price of our securities could result in the filing of securities class action litigation matters, which could
result in substantial costs and the diversion of management time and resources.

Failure to maintain a satisfactory credit rating could adversely affect our liquidity, capital position,
borrowing costs and access to capital markets.

We currently maintain investment grade credit ratings with Moody’s Investors Service, Standard & Poor’s

Ratings Services and Fitch Ratings Services. Despite these investment grade credit ratings, any future
downgrades could increase the cost of borrowing under any indebtedness we may incur, reduce market
capacity for our commercial paper or require the posting of additional collateral under our derivative contracts.
Additionally, increased borrowing costs, including those arising from a credit rating downgrade, can potentially
reduce the competitiveness of our financing business. There can be no assurance that we will be able to
maintain our credit ratings, and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit
ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade, may have a negative
impact on our liquidity, capital position and access to capital markets.

Our debt obligations may adversely affect our business and our ability to meet our obligations and pay
dividends.

In addition to our current total carrying debt, we may also incur additional indebtedness in the future. This

collective amount of debt could have important adverse consequences to us and our investors, including:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

requiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make principal and interest
payments;

making it more difficult to satisfy other obligations;

increasing the risk of a future credit ratings downgrade of our debt, which could increase future debt
costs and limit the future availability of debt financing;

increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;

reducing the cash flows available to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to
grow our business;

limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry; and

limiting our ability to borrow additional funds as needed or take advantage of business opportunities
as they arise, pay cash dividends or repurchase our common stock.

To the extent that we incur additional indebtedness, the risks described above could increase. In addition,

our actual cash requirements in the future may be greater than expected. Our cash flow from operations may
not be sufficient to service our outstanding debt or to repay our outstanding debt as it becomes due, and we
may not be able to borrow money, sell assets or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms, or at all, to service
or refinance our debt.

Certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated
bylaws, and of Delaware law, may prevent or delay an acquisition of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which
could decrease the trading price of our common stock.

We have provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, each of which could have the effect of

rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition of Hewlett Packard Enterprise deemed undesirable by
our Board of Directors. These include provisions:

•

•

•

•

•

authorizing blank check preferred stock, which we could issue with voting, liquidation, dividend and
other rights superior to our common stock;

limiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers;

specifying that our stockholders may take action only at a duly called annual or special meeting of
stockholders and otherwise in accordance with our bylaws and limiting the ability of our stockholders
to call special meetings;

requiring advance notice of proposals by our stockholders for business to be conducted at
stockholder meetings and for nominations of candidates for election to our Board of Directors; and

controlling the procedures for conduct of our Board of Directors and stockholder meetings and
election, appointment and removal of our directors.

These provisions, alone or together, could deter or delay hostile takeovers, proxy contests and changes in

control or management of Hewlett Packard Enterprise. As a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to
provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prevents
some stockholders from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of
substantially all of our outstanding common stock.

Any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying

or deterring a change in control of Hewlett Packard Enterprise could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to
receive a premium for their shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise stock and also could affect the price that
some investors are willing to pay for Hewlett Packard Enterprise stock.

Risks Related to the Separations of our Former Enterprise Services Business and our Former Software
Segment

The stock distribution in either or both of the completed separations of our former Enterprise Services
business and our former Software segment could result in significant tax liability, and DXC or Micro
Focus (as applicable) may in certain cases be obligated to indemnify us for any such tax liability
imposed on us.

The completed separations of our former Enterprise Services business and our Software Segment were
conditioned upon the receipt of an opinion from outside counsel regarding the qualification of (i) the relevant
distribution and related transactions as a ‘‘reorganization’’ within the meaning of Sections 368(a), 361 and 355
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the ‘‘Code’’); and (ii) the relevant merger as a ‘‘reorganization’’ within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. While the Software Separation is generally expected to qualify for
tax-free treatment for us, Seattle SpinCo and Micro Focus, the acquisition of Seattle SpinCo by Micro Focus is
expected to result in the recognition of gain (but not loss) for U.S. persons who receive Micro Focus American
Depositary Shares in the Software Separation.

Each opinion of outside counsel was based upon and relied on, among other things, certain facts and

assumptions, as well as certain representations, statements and undertakings of us, Everett SpinCo and CSC,
or us, Seattle SpinCo and Micro Focus, as applicable. If any of these representations, statements or
undertakings are, or become, inaccurate or incomplete, or if any party breaches any of its covenants in the
relevant separation documents, the relevant opinion of counsel may be invalid and the conclusions reached
therein could be jeopardized. Notwithstanding the opinions of counsel, the Internal Revenue Service (the ‘‘IRS’’)
could determine that either or both of the distributions should be treated as a taxable transaction if it
determines that any of the facts, assumptions, representations, statements or undertakings upon which the
relevant opinion of counsel was based are false or have been violated, or if it disagrees with the conclusions in
the opinion of counsel. An opinion of counsel is not binding on the IRS and there can be no assurance that the
IRS will not assert a contrary position.

If the distribution of Everett SpinCo or Seattle SpinCo, as applicable, together with certain related

transactions, failed to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free, for U.S. federal income tax purposes,
under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, in general, we would recognize taxable gain as if we had
sold the stock of Everett SpinCo or Seattle SpinCo, as applicable, in a taxable sale for its fair market value,
and our stockholders who receive Everett SpinCo shares or Seattle SpinCo shares in the relevant distribution
would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such
shares.

We obtained a private letter ruling from the IRS regarding certain matters impacting the U.S. federal
income tax treatment of the completed separation of our former Enterprise Services business and certain
related transactions as transactions that are generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The
conclusions of the IRS private letter ruling were based, among other things, on various factual assumptions we
have authorized and representations we have made to the IRS. If any of these assumptions or representations
are, or become, inaccurate or incomplete, reliance on the IRS private letter ruling may be affected.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, we incurred certain tax costs in connection with the completed separation of our
former Enterprise Services business, including non-U.S. tax expenses resulting from the completed separation
of our former Enterprise Services business in multiple non-U.S. jurisdictions that do not legally provide for
tax-free separations, which may be material. If the completed separation of our former Enterprise Services
business or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the completed separation of our former
Enterprise Services business are determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we, our
stockholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax and/or DXC could incur significant U.S. federal income
tax liabilities.

We have applied for a private letter ruling from the IRS regarding certain U.S. federal income tax matters
relating to the Software Separation and certain related transactions as transactions that are generally tax-free
for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The conclusions of the IRS private letter ruling will be based, among
other things, on various factual assumptions we have authorized and representations we have made to the
IRS. If any of these assumptions or representations are, or become, inaccurate or incomplete, the validity of
the IRS private letter ruling may be affected. If the completed separation of our former Software Segment or
certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the completed separation of our former Software

Segment are determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or if we do not receive the private
letter ruling concluding that the transactions are generally tax-free, we, our stockholders that are subject to U.S.
federal income tax and/or Micro Focus could be subject to significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, we incurred certain tax costs in connection with the completed separation of our
former Software Segment business, including non-U.S. tax expenses resulting from the completed separation
of our former Software Segment business in multiple non-U.S. jurisdictions that do not legally provide for
tax-free separations, which may be material.

Under the tax matters agreements entered into by us with Everett SpinCo and CSC, and with Seattle

SpinCo and Micro Focus, Everett SpinCo and Seattle SpinCo generally would be required to indemnify us for
any taxes resulting from the relevant separation (and any related costs and other damages) to the extent such
amounts resulted from (i) certain actions taken by, or acquisitions of capital stock of, Everett SpinCo or Seattle
SpinCo, as applicable (excluding actions required by the documents governing the relevant Separation), or
(ii) any breach of certain representations and covenants made by Everett SpinCo or Seattle SpinCo, as
applicable. Any such indemnity obligations could be material.

Risks Related to the Prior Separation from Former Parent

If the distribution, together with certain related transactions, does not qualify as a transaction that is
generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and those who
received Hewlett Packard Enterprise common stock in the distribution could be subject to significant
tax liabilities, and, in certain circumstances, Hewlett Packard Enterprise could be required to indemnify
HP Inc. for material taxes and other related amounts pursuant to indemnification obligations under the
tax matters agreement.

It was a condition to the distribution that our former Parent receive (i) a private letter ruling from the U.S.

Internal Revenue Service (the ‘‘IRS’’) and/or one or more opinions from its external tax advisors, regarding
certain U.S. federal income tax matters relating to the Separation and related transactions, and (ii) opinions of
outside counsel regarding the qualification of the distribution, together with certain related transactions, as a
transaction that is generally tax-free, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, under Sections 355 and
368(a)(1)(D) of the Code. These opinions of outside counsel or other external tax advisors and the IRS private
letter ruling were based, among other things, on various facts and assumptions, as well as certain
representations, statements and undertakings of HP Co. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (including those
relating to the past and future conduct of HP Co. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise). If, in the future, any of
these facts, assumptions, representations, statements or undertakings is, or becomes, inaccurate or
incomplete, or if HP Inc., as successor to HP Co., or Hewlett Packard Enterprise breach any of their respective
covenants contained in any of the Separation-related agreements or in the documents relating to the IRS
private letter ruling and/or any tax opinion, the IRS private letter ruling and/or any tax opinion may be rendered
invalid. Accordingly, notwithstanding HP Co.’s receipt of the IRS private letter ruling and/or opinions of counsel
or other external tax advisors, the IRS could determine that the distribution and certain related transactions
should be treated as taxable transactions for U.S. federal income tax purposes if it determines that any of the
facts, assumptions, representations, statements or undertakings that were included in the request for the IRS
private letter ruling or on which any opinion was based are false or have been violated. In addition, the IRS
private letter ruling does not address all of the issues that are relevant to determining whether the distribution,
together with certain related transactions, qualifies as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, and an opinion of outside counsel or other external tax advisor represents the judgment
of such counsel or advisor which is not binding on the IRS or any court. Accordingly, notwithstanding receipt by
HP Co. of the IRS private letter ruling and the tax opinions referred to above, there can be no assurance that
the IRS will not assert that the distribution and/or certain related transactions do not qualify for tax-free
treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. In the event
the IRS were to prevail with such challenge, HP Inc., Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Co. stockholders who
received Hewlett Packard Enterprise common stock in the distribution could be subject to significant U.S.
federal income tax liability.

If the distribution, together with certain related transactions, is found to no longer qualify as a transaction
that is generally tax-free under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, in general, for U.S. federal income
tax purposes, HP Inc. would recognize taxable gain as if it has sold the Hewlett Packard Enterprise common
stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value and HP Co. stockholders who received shares of Hewlett

|28

HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE

Packard Enterprise common stock in the distribution would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable
distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares.

Under the tax matters agreement we entered into with HP Inc. in connection with the Separation (the
‘‘Tax Matters Agreement’’), we are generally required to indemnify HP Inc. for any taxes resulting from the
Separation (and any related costs and other damages) to the extent such amounts resulted from (i) an
acquisition of all or a portion of the equity securities or assets of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, whether by
merger or otherwise (and regardless of whether we participated in or otherwise facilitated the acquisition),
(ii) other actions or failures to act by Hewlett Packard Enterprise or (iii) any of the representations or
undertakings of Hewlett Packard Enterprise contained in any of the Separation-related agreements or in the
documents relating to the IRS private letter ruling and/or any tax opinion being incorrect or violated. Any such
indemnity obligations could be material.

Our historical financial information for periods prior to the Separation is not necessarily representative
of the results that we would have achieved as a separate, publicly traded company and may not be a
reliable indicator of our future results.

The historical information about Hewlett Packard Enterprise relating to fiscal years prior to 2016 in this

Form 10-K refers to our business as formerly operated by and integrated with our former Parent, and does not
necessarily reflect the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows that we would have achieved as a
separate, publicly traded company during the period presented or those that we will achieve in the future
primarily as a result of the following factors, among others:

•

•

•

•

Prior to the Separation, our business was operated by our former Parent as part of its broader
corporate organization, rather than as an independent company. Our former Parent or one of its
affiliates performed various corporate functions for us such as legal, treasury, accounting, internal
auditing, human resources and corporate affairs, and also provided our IT and other corporate
infrastructure. Our historical financial results reflect allocations of corporate expenses from our
former Parent for such functions and are likely to be less than the expenses we would have incurred
had we operated as a separate publicly traded company.

Historically, when we were integrated with the other businesses of our former Parent, we shared
economies of scope and scale in costs, employees, vendor relationships and customer relationships.
Although we have entered into certain agreements (including a transition services agreement) with
HP Inc. in connection with the Separation, these arrangements may not fully capture the benefits
that we enjoyed as a result of being integrated with our former Parent and may result in us paying
higher charges than in the past for these services. This could have an adverse effect on our results
of operations and financial condition in future periods.

Generally, our working capital requirements and capital for our general corporate purposes, including
acquisitions and capital expenditures, had been satisfied as part of the corporate-wide cash
management policies of our former Parent prior to the Separation. In connection with the Separation,
we have entered into certain financing arrangements described under the section entitled
‘‘Description of Material Indebtedness’’ as part of our transition to becoming a standalone company.
We may in the future need to obtain additional financing from banks, through public offerings or
private placements of debt or equity securities, strategic relationships or other arrangements.

The cost of capital for our business may be higher than our former Parent’s cost of capital prior to
the Separation.

Other significant changes have occurred and may occur in our cost structure, management, financing and
business operations as a result of operating as a separate company. For additional information about the past
financial performance of our business and the basis of presentation of the historical consolidated and combined
financial statements of our business, see ‘‘Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements,’’ ‘‘Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations’’ and the historical Consolidated and
Combined Financial Statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

The Separation and Distribution Agreement that we entered into with our former Parent may limit our
ability to compete in certain markets and may impose limitations on our recruiting efforts for a period
of time following the Separation.

The Separation and Distribution Agreement includes non-compete provisions pursuant to which we
generally agree to not compete with HP Inc. in certain product and service categories that comprise the
HP Inc. business, including personal computers and printers, worldwide for three years from the distribution
date. Such restrictions are subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Separation and Distribution Agreement.
These restrictions may limit our ability to compete in certain markets, and could materially and adversely affect
our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise or HP Inc. may fail to perform under the transition services agreement and
other transaction agreements executed as part of the Separation, and we may not have necessary
systems and services in place when these transaction agreements expire.

In connection with the Separation, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. entered into several

agreements, including among others a transition services agreement (the ‘‘Transition Services Agreement’’), the
Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Tax Matters Agreement, an employee matters agreement (the
‘‘Employee Matters Agreement’’), a real estate matters agreement (the ‘‘Real Estate Matters Agreement’’), a
commercial agreement (the ‘‘Master Commercial Agreement’’) and an IT service agreement (the ‘‘Information
Technology Service Agreement’’ or the ‘‘IT Service Agreement’’). The Transition Services Agreement provides
for the performance of certain services by each company for the benefit of the other for a transition period after
the Separation. The Separation and Distribution Agreement, Tax Matters Agreement, Employee Matters
Agreement and Real Estate Matters Agreement determine the allocation of assets and liabilities between the
companies following the Separation for those respective areas and include any necessary indemnifications
related to liabilities and obligations. The Master Commercial Agreement establishes a bilateral relationship
between HP Inc. and us for the purchase and sale of commercially available products and services for internal
use, incorporation and bundling in OEM products and services, resale to customers and use in the provision of
managed services to customers, as well as joint customer pursuits and joint development activities. The IT
Service Agreement provides for the performance by one of our subsidiaries of certain application development
and maintenance and IT infrastructure services for HP Inc. We rely on HP Inc. to satisfy its performance and
payment obligations under these agreements. If HP Inc. is unable to satisfy its obligations under these
agreements, including its obligations with respect to the provision of transition services, we could incur
operational difficulties or losses that could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

Indemnification liabilities to HP Inc. pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement could
materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

The Separation and Distribution Agreement provides for, among other things, indemnification obligations

generally designed to make us financially responsible for (i) liabilities primarily associated with our business;
(ii) our failure to pay, perform or otherwise promptly discharge any such liabilities or contracts, in accordance
with their respective terms, whether prior to, at or after the distribution; (iii) any guarantee, indemnification
obligation, surety bond or other credit support agreement, arrangement, commitment or understanding by
HP Inc. for our benefit, unless related to liabilities primarily associated with the HP Inc. business; (iv) any
breach by us of the separation agreement or any of the ancillary agreements or any action by us in
contravention of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws; and
(v) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state
a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, with
respect to all information contained in our registration statement on Form 10 or any other disclosure document
that describes the Separation or the distribution or Hewlett Packard Enterprise and its subsidiaries or primarily
relates to the transactions contemplated by the Separation and Distribution Agreement, subject to certain
exceptions. If we are required to indemnify HP Inc. under the circumstances set forth in the Separation and
Distribution Agreement, we may be subject to substantial liabilities.

HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE

In connection with the Separation, HP Inc. has indemnified us for certain liabilities. However, there can
be no assurance that the indemnity will be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of such
liabilities, or that HP Inc.’s ability to satisfy its indemnification obligation will not be impaired in the
future.

Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement and certain other agreements we have entered
into with HP Inc., HP Inc. has agreed to indemnify Hewlett Packard Enterprise for certain liabilities. However,
third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that HP Inc. has agreed to retain,
and there can be no assurance that the indemnity from HP Inc. will be sufficient to protect us against the full
amount of such liabilities, or that HP Inc. will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. In addition,
HP Inc.’s insurers may attempt to deny us coverage for liabilities associated with certain occurrences of
indemnified liabilities prior to the Separation. Moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from
HP Inc. or such insurance providers any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required
to bear these losses. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business, financial position, results of
operations and cash flows.

We are subject to continuing contingent liabilities as a result of our separation from our former Parent.

As a result of the Separation from our former Parent, there are several significant areas where the

liabilities of our former Parent have or may become our obligations. For example, under the Code and the
related rules and regulations, each corporation that was a member of the consolidated U.S. federal income tax
return group of our former Parent during a taxable period or portion of a taxable period ending on or before the
effective date of the distribution is severally liable for the U.S. federal income tax liability of the consolidated
U.S. federal income tax return group of our former Parent for that taxable period. Consequently, if HP Inc. is
unable to pay the consolidated U.S. federal income tax liability for a pre-Separation period, we could be
required to pay the amount of such tax, which could be substantial and in excess of the amount allocated to us
under the tax matters agreement.

Potential liabilities may arise due to fraudulent transfer considerations, which would adversely affect
our financial condition and results of operations.

In connection with the Separation and distribution, our former Parent undertook several corporate

reorganization transactions involving its subsidiaries which, along with the Separation and distribution, may be
subject to federal and state fraudulent conveyance and transfer laws. If, under these laws, a court were to
determine that, at the time of the Separation and distribution, any entity involved in these reorganization
transactions or the Separation and distribution:

•

•

•

•

was insolvent;

was rendered insolvent by reason of the Separation and distribution;

had remaining assets constituting unreasonably small capital; or

intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay these debts as they
matured, then the court could void the Separation and distribution, in whole or in part, as a
fraudulent conveyance or transfer. The court could then require our stockholders to return to HP Inc.
some or all of the shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise common stock issued in the distribution, or
require HP Inc. or Hewlett Packard Enterprise, as the case may be, to fund liabilities of the other
company for the benefit of creditors. The measure of insolvency will vary depending upon the
jurisdiction whose law is being applied. Generally, however, an entity would be considered insolvent
if the fair value of its assets was less than the amount of its liabilities, or if it incurred debt beyond its
ability to repay the debt as it matures.

service obligations, restrictive covenants in our debt, industry practice, legal requirements, regulatory
constraints, and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant. Our ability to pay dividends will
depend on our ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and on our access to the capital markets. We

During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2017, the Company repurchased and settled 136 million shares
of the Company’s common stock, which were retired and recorded as a $2.6 billion reduction to stockholders’
equity.

On October 13, 2015, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program with a $3.0 billion

authorization, which was refreshed with additional share repurchase authorizations of $3.0 billion and
$5.0 billion on May 24, 2016 and October 16, 2017, respectively. As of October 31, 2017, the Company had a
remaining authorization of $5.8 billion for future share repurchases. The Company may choose to repurchase
shares when sufficient liquidity exists and the shares are trading at a discount relative to estimated intrinsic
value. This program, which does not have a specific expiration date, authorizes repurchases in the open
market or in private transactions. Share repurchases settled in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 were open
market repurchases. As of October 31, 2017, the Company had unsettled open market repurchases of
1.7 million shares, which were recorded as a $24 million reduction to stockholders’ equity.

Stock Performance Graph and Cumulative Total Return

The graph below shows the cumulative total stockholder return, the S&P 500 Index and the S&P

Information Technology Index. This graph covers the period from November 2, 2015 (the first day HPE’s
common stock began trading ‘‘regular-way’’ on the NYSE) through October 31, 2017. This graph assumes the
investment of $100 in the stock or the index on November 2, 2015 (and the reinvestment of dividends
thereafter). On April 1, 2017, we completed the separation and merger of our Enterprise Services business with
Computer Sciences Corporation (‘‘CSC’’) (collectively, the ‘‘Everett Transaction’’). HPE stockholders received
0.085904 shares of common stock in the new company for every one share of HPE common stock held at the
close of business on the record date. On September 1, 2017, we completed the separation and merger of our
Software business segment with Micro Focus International plc (‘‘Micro Focus’’) (collectively, the ‘‘Seattle
Transaction’’). HPE stockholders received 0.13732611 American Depository Shares (‘‘Micro Focus ADSs’’) in
the new company, each of which represents one ordinary share of Micro Focus, for every one share of HPE
common stock held at the close of business on the record date. The effect of the Everett and Seattle
Transactions are reflected in the cumulative total return as reinvested dividends. The comparisons in the graph

ITEM 6. Selected Financial Data.

The following table presents selected consolidated and combined financial data, which should be read in

conjunction with our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements and accompanying notes and
‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations’’ included elsewhere
in this Form 10-K. The Statement of Earnings data for each of the three fiscal years ended October 31, 2017,
2016 and 2015, and the Balance Sheet data as of October 31, 2017 and 2016 set forth below are derived from
our audited Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. The
Statement of Earnings data for fiscal year ended October 31, 2014 and the Balance Sheet data as of
October 31, 2015, are derived from our audited Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements that are not
included in this Form 10-K. The Statement of Earnings data for fiscal year ended October 31, 2013 and the
Balance Sheet data as of October 31, 2014 and 2013 are derived from our audited Combined Financial
Statements that are not included in this Form 10-K.

With the completion of the Everett and Seattle Transactions on April 1, 2017 and September 1, 2017,
respectively, the Company has reclassified the historical financial results of the former Enterprise Services
segment (‘‘former ES segment’’) and the former Software segment to Net loss from discontinued operations in
its Consolidated and Combined Statements of Earnings, and to assets and liabilities of discontinued operations
in its Consolidated and Combined Balance Sheets.

HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE

Prior to October 31, 2015, the Combined and Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the Company
reflect allocations of general corporate expenses from former Parent including, but not limited to, executive
management, finance, legal, information technology, employee benefits administration, treasury, risk
management, procurement, and other shared services. These allocations were made on a direct usage basis
when identifiable, with the remainder allocated on the basis of revenue, expenses, headcount, or other relevant
measures. Management of the Company and former Parent consider these allocations to be a reasonable
reflection of the utilization of services by, or the benefits provided to, the Company. The allocations may not,
however, reflect the expense the Company would have incurred as a standalone company for the periods
presented. Actual costs that may have been incurred if the Company had been a standalone company would
depend on a number of factors, including the chosen organizational structure, what functions were outsourced
or performed by employees and strategic decisions made in areas such as information technology and
infrastructure.

The information set forth below is not necessarily indicative of future results of operations and should be
read in conjunction with Item 7, ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations,’’ and the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements and notes thereto included in Item 8,
‘‘Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,’’ of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which are incorporated
herein by reference, in order to understand further the factors that may affect the comparability of the financial
data presented below.

ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations

This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (‘‘MD&A’’)

is organized as follows:

•

•

•

•

•

Overview. A discussion of our business and overall analysis of financial and other highlights
affecting the Company to provide context for the remainder of MD&A. The overview analysis
compares fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2016.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates. A discussion of accounting policies and estimates that
we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our
reported financial results.

Results of Operations. An analysis of our financial results comparing fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 to
the prior-year periods. A discussion of the results of operations at the consolidated and combined
level is followed by a discussion of the results of operations at the segment level.

Liquidity and Capital Resources. An analysis of changes in our cash flows and a discussion of our
financial condition and liquidity.

Contractual and Other Obligations. An overview of contractual obligations, retirement and
post-retirement benefit plan funding, restructuring plans, uncertain tax positions, off-balance sheet
arrangements, cross-indemnifications with HP Inc. (formerly known as ‘‘Hewlett-Packard Company’’
and also referred to in this Annual Report as ‘‘former Parent’’), and cross-indemnifications with DXC
Technology Company (‘‘DXC’’) and Micro Focus International plc (‘‘Micro Focus’’).

We intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide

information that will assist the reader in understanding our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements,
the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, and the primary factors that
accounted for those changes, as well as how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our
Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our
Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this
document.

Former Parent Separation Transaction

On November 1, 2015, HP Inc. spun-off Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (‘‘the Separation’’). To

effect the spin-off, HP Inc. distributed all of the shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (‘‘HPE’’)
common stock owned by HP Inc. to its stockholders on November 1, 2015. Holders of HP Inc. common stock
received one share of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company stock for every share of HP Inc. stock held as of
the record date. As a result of the Separation, we now operate as an independent, publicly-traded company.

Enterprise Services Separation Transaction

On April 1, 2017, we completed the separation and merger of our Enterprise Services business with

Computer Sciences Corporation (‘‘CSC’’) (collectively, the ‘‘Everett Transaction’’). The Everett Transaction was
accomplished by a series of transactions among CSC, HPE, Everett SpinCo, Inc. (a wholly-owned subsidiary of
HPE) (‘‘Everett’’), and New Everett Merger Sub Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Everett (‘‘Merger Sub’’). We
transferred the Enterprise Services business to Everett and distributed all of the shares of Everett to HPE
stockholders. HPE stockholders received 0.085904 shares of common stock in the new company for every one
share of HPE common stock held at the close of business on the record date. Following the distribution, the
Merger Sub merged with and into CSC, which became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Everett. At the time of the
merger, Everett changed its name to DXC.

Software Segment Separation Transaction

On September 1, 2017, we completed the separation and merger of our Software business segment with
Micro Focus (collectively, the ‘‘Seattle Transaction’’). The Seattle Transaction was accomplished by a series of
transactions among Micro Focus, HPE, Seattle SpinCo, Inc. (a wholly-owned subsidiary of HPE) (‘‘Seattle’’),
and Seattle Merger Sub, Inc., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Micro Focus (‘‘Merger Sub’’). We
transferred the Software business segment to Seattle and distributed all of the shares of Seattle to HPE
stockholders. HPE stockholders received 0.13732611 American Depository Shares (‘‘Micro Focus ADSs’’) in
the new company, each of which represents one ordinary share of Micro Focus, for every one share of HPE
common stock held at the close of business on the record date. Following the share distribution, the Merger
Sub merged with and into Seattle, which became an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Micro Focus.

With the completion of the Everett and Seattle Transactions, we have reclassified the historical financial

results of our former Enterprise Services segment (‘‘former ES segment’’) and our former Software segment to
Net loss from discontinued operations in our Consolidated and Combined Statements of Earnings, and to
assets and liabilities of discontinued operations in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The following Overview, Results of Operations and Liquidity discussions and analysis compare fiscal 2017

to fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2015, unless otherwise noted. The Capital Resources and Contractual
and Other Obligations discussions present information as of October 31, 2017, unless otherwise noted.

For purposes of this MD&A section, we use the terms ‘‘Hewlett Packard Enterprise,’’ ‘‘HPE,’’ ‘‘the

Company,’’ ‘‘we,’’ ‘‘us,’’ and ‘‘our’’ to refer to Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company. References in this MD&A
section to ‘‘former Parent’’ refer to HP Inc.

OVERVIEW

We are an industry leading technology company that enables customers to go further, faster. With a deep

Net revenue decreased by $1.4 billion, or 4.7% (decreased 4.1% on a constant currency basis), in fiscal

2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. The leading contributor to the net revenue decrease was a net revenue
decline in EG due primarily to a decline in Servers revenue as a result of lower revenue from Tier-1 server
sales and a decline in Networking revenue as a result of the divestiture of our controlling interest in the H3C
Technologies and China-based Server, Storage and Technology Services businesses (‘‘H3C divestiture’’) in
May 2016. Gross margin was 30.1% ($8.7 billion) and 32.3% ($9.8 billion) for fiscal 2017 and 2016,
respectively. The 2.2 percentage point decrease in gross margin was due primarily to lower gross margins in
EG as a result of higher commodity costs, particularly dynamic random-access memory (‘‘DRAM’’), and
competitive pressures affecting Servers and Storage, the impact of the H3C divestiture, particularly in
Networking, and unfavorable currency fluctuations. We continue to experience gross margin pressures resulting
from increased commodity costs, particularly DRAM, and a competitive pricing environment across our
hardware portfolio. Operating margin decreased by 10.7 percentage points in fiscal 2017 due primarily to gains
associated with the H3C and MphasiS divestitures recorded in the prior-year period.

As of October 31, 2017, cash and cash equivalents were approximately $9.6 billion, representing a

decrease of approximately $3.4 billion from the October 31, 2016 balance of approximately $13.0 billion. The
decrease in cash and cash equivalents was due primarily to the following: debt payments of $3.8 billion, share
repurchases and cash dividend payments of $3.0 billion, investments in property, plant and equipment, net of
sales proceeds of $2.5 billion, and payments made in connection with business acquisitions of $2.2 billion,
partially offset by cash dividends received from Everett and Seattle totaling $5.5 billion and proceeds from debt
issuances of $2.3 billion.

Trends and Uncertainties

We are in the process of addressing many challenges facing our business. One set of challenges include
dynamic and accelerating market trends, such as the market shift of workloads to cloud-related IT infrastructure
business models, emergence of software-defined architectures and converged infrastructure functionality and
growth in IT consumption models. Certain of our legacy hardware businesses in EG face challenges as
customers migrate to cloud-based offerings and reduce their purchases of hardware products. Demand for core
server products and traditional storage has weakened and lower traditional compute and storage unit volume is
impacting support attach opportunities in Technology Services (‘‘TS’’) within the EG segment.

Another set of challenges relates to changes in the competitive landscape. Our major competitors are
expanding their product and service offerings with integrated products and solutions, our business-specific
competitors are exerting increased competitive pressure in targeted areas and are entering new markets, our
emerging competitors are introducing new technologies and business models, and our alliance partners in
some businesses are increasingly becoming our competitors in others.

A third set of challenges relates to business model changes and our go-to-market execution.

To be successful in overcoming these challenges, we must address business model shifts and optimize

go-to-market execution by improving cost structure, aligning sales coverage with strategic goals, improving
channel execution, and strengthening our capabilities in our areas of strategic focus, while continuing to pursue
new product innovation that builds on our existing capabilities in areas such as cloud and data center
computing, software-defined networking, converged storage, high-performance compute, and wireless
networking, which will keep us aligned with market demand, industry trends and the needs of our customers
and partners. In addition, we need to continue to improve our operations, with a particular focus on enhancing
our end-to-end processes and efficiencies.

architect a purpose-built company designed to compete and win in the markets where we participate. Through
this initiative, we will simplify our operating model and the way we work. We will streamline our offerings and
business processes to improve our execution. More importantly, we will continue to shift our investments in
innovation towards high growth and higher margin solutions and services. This initiative includes consolidating
our manufacturing and support services locations, streamlining our business systems and reducing the number
of countries in which we have a direct sales presence, while simultaneously migrating to a channel-only model
in the remaining countries. For additional details on the HPE Next initiative, see Note 5, ‘‘HPE Next’’, to the
Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II, which is incorporated herein by
reference.

For a further discussion of trends, uncertainties and other factors that could impact our operating results,

see the section entitled ‘‘Risk Factors’’ in Item 1A, which is incorporated herein by reference.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

General

Our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally

Accepted Accounting Principles (‘‘GAAP’’), which requires management to make estimates, judgments and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net revenue and expenses, and the
disclosure of contingent liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various
other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the
basis for making judgments about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
from other sources. Management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates
with the Audit Committee of HPE’s Board of Directors. Management believes that the accounting estimates
employed and the resulting amounts are reasonable; however, actual results may differ from these estimates.
Making estimates and judgments about future events is inherently unpredictable and is subject to significant
uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change
or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position
and cash flows.

A summary of significant accounting policies is included in Note 1, ‘‘Overview and Summary of Significant

Accounting Policies’’, to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II, which is
incorporated herein by reference. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting
estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is
made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably
possible could materially impact the financial statements. Management believes the following critical accounting
policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Consolidated and
Combined Financial Statements.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or

services are rendered, the sales price or fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured,
as well as when other revenue recognition principles are met, including industry-specific revenue recognition
guidance.

We enter into contracts to sell our products and services, and while many of our sales agreements

contain standard terms and conditions, there are agreements we enter into which contain non-standard terms
and conditions. Further, many of our arrangements include multiple elements. As a result, significant contract
interpretation may be required to determine the appropriate accounting, including the identification of
deliverables considered to be separate units of accounting, the allocation of the transaction price among
elements in the arrangement and the timing of revenue recognition for each of those elements.

HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

We recognize revenue for delivered elements as separate units of accounting when the delivered
elements have standalone value to the customer. For elements with no standalone value, we recognize
revenue consistent with the pattern of the undelivered elements. If the arrangement includes a customer-
negotiated refund or return right or other contingency relative to the delivered items and the delivery and
performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially within our control, the delivered
element constitutes a separate unit of accounting. In arrangements with combined units of accounting, changes
in the allocation of the transaction price among elements may impact the timing of revenue recognition for the
contract but will not change the total revenue recognized for the contract.

We establish the selling prices used for each deliverable based on vendor-specific objective evidence

(‘‘VSOE’’) of selling price, if available, third-party evidence (‘‘TPE’’), if VSOE of selling price is not available, or
estimated selling price (‘‘ESP’’), if neither VSOE of selling price nor TPE is available. We establish VSOE of
selling price using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately and, in rare instances, using the
price established by management having the relevant authority. TPE of selling price is established by
evaluating largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly
situated customers. ESP is established based on management’s judgment considering internal factors such as
margin objectives, pricing practices and controls, customer segment pricing strategies and the product
life-cycle. Consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and technology
industry life-cycles. We may modify or develop new go-to-market practices in the future, which may result in
changes in selling prices, impacting both VSOE of selling price and ESP. In most arrangements with multiple
elements, the transaction price is allocated to the individual units of accounting at inception of the arrangement
based on their relative selling price. However, the aforementioned factors may result in a different allocation of
the transaction price to deliverables in multiple element arrangements entered into in future periods. This may
change the pattern and timing of revenue recognition for identical arrangements executed in future periods, but
will not change the total revenue recognized for any given arrangement.

We reduce revenue for customer and distributor programs and incentive offerings, including price

protection, rebates, promotions, other volume-based incentives and expected returns. Future market conditions
and product transitions may require us to take actions to increase customer incentive offerings, possibly
resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered. For certain incentive
programs, we estimate the number of customers expected to redeem the incentive based on historical
experience and the specific terms and conditions of the incentive.

For hardware products, we recognize revenue generated from direct sales to end customers and indirect

sales to channel partners (including resellers, distributors and value-added solution providers) when the
revenue recognition criteria are satisfied. For indirect sales to channel partners, we recognize revenue at the
time of delivery when the channel partner has economic substance apart from us and we have completed our
obligations related to the sale.

For the various software products we sell, we assess whether the software products were sold on a

standalone basis or with hardware products. If the software sold with a hardware product is not essential to the
functionality of the hardware product and is more-than-incidental, we treat it as a software deliverable.

We recognize revenue from the sale of perpetual software licenses at inception of the license term,

assuming all revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied. Term-based software license revenue is generally
recognized ratably over the term of the license. We use the residual method to allocate revenue to software
licenses at inception of the arrangement when VSOE of fair value for all undelivered elements, such as
post-contract customer support, exists and all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied. Revenue
from maintenance and unspecified upgrades or updates provided on a when-and-if-available basis is
recognized ratably over the period during which such items are delivered.

For SaaS arrangements, we recognize revenue as the service is delivered, generally on a straight-line

basis, over the contractual period of performance.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

We recognize revenue from fixed-price support or maintenance contracts, including extended warranty

contracts and software post-contract customer support agreements, ratably over the contract period. For certain
fixed-price contracts, such as consulting arrangements, we recognize revenue as work progresses using a
proportional performance method. We estimate the total expected labor costs in order to determine the amount
of revenue earned to date. We apply a proportional performance method because reasonably dependable
estimates of the labor costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made. Total project costs are
regularly reassessed during the life of a fixed-price contract. Provisions for estimated losses on fixed-price
contracts are recognized in the period when such losses become known and are recorded as a component of
cost of sales. In circumstances when reasonable and reliable cost estimates for a project cannot be made we
recognize revenue using the completed contract method.

Warranty

We accrue the estimated cost of product warranties at the time we recognize revenue. We evaluate our

warranty obligations on a product group basis. Our standard product warranty terms generally include
post-sales support and repairs or replacement of a product at no additional charge for a specified period of
time. While we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and
evaluating the quality of our component suppliers, we base our estimated warranty obligation on contractual
warranty terms, repair costs, product call rates, average cost per call, current period product shipments and
ongoing product failure rates, as well as specific product class failure outside of our baseline experience.
Warranty terms generally range from one to five years for parts and labor, depending upon the product. For
certain networking products, we offer a lifetime warranty. Over the last three fiscal years, the annual warranty
expense has averaged approximately 1.9% of annual net product revenue.

Restructuring

We have engaged in restructuring actions which require management to estimate the timing and amount

of severance and other employee separation costs for workforce reduction and enhanced early retirement
programs, the fair value of assets made redundant or obsolete, and the fair value of lease and contract
cancellation and other exit costs. We accrue for severance and other employee separation costs under these
actions when it is probable that benefits will be paid and the amount is reasonably estimable. The rates used in
determining severance accruals are based on existing plans, historical experiences and negotiated settlements.
For a full description of our restructuring actions, refer to our discussions of restructuring in ‘‘Results of
Operations’’ below and in Note 4, ‘‘Restructuring’’ and Note 5, ‘‘HPE Next’’, to the Consolidated and Combined
Financial Statements.

Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefits

Our pension and other post-retirement benefit costs and obligations depend on various assumptions. Our
major assumptions relate primarily to discount rates, mortality rates, expected increases in compensation levels
and the expected long-term return on plan assets. The discount rate assumption is based on current
investment yields of high-quality fixed-income securities with maturities similar to the expected benefits payment
period. Mortality rates help predict the expected life of plan participants and are based on a historical
demographic study of the plan. The expected increase in the compensation levels assumption reflects our
long-term actual experience and future expectations. The expected long-term return on plan assets is
determined based on asset allocations, historical portfolio results, historical asset correlations and
management’s expected returns for each asset class. In any fiscal year, significant differences may arise
between the actual return and the expected long-term return on plan assets. Historically, differences between
the actual return and expected long-term return on plan assets have resulted from changes in target or actual
asset allocation, short-term performance relative to expected long-term performance, and to a lesser extent,
differences between target and actual investment allocations, the timing of benefit payments compared to
expectations, and the use of derivatives intended to effect asset allocation changes or hedge certain
investment or liability exposures.

Taxes on Earnings

For fiscal 2015 and prior, current income tax liabilities related to entities which filed jointly with former

Parent are assumed to be immediately settled with former Parent and are relieved through the former Parent
company investment account and the Net transfers to former Parent in the Consolidated and Combined
Statements of Cash Flows. Income tax expense and other income tax related information contained in our
Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements are presented on a separate return basis as if we filed our
own tax returns. The separate return method applies the accounting guidance for income taxes to the
standalone financial statements as if we were a separate taxpayer and a standalone enterprise for fiscal 2015.
The calculation of our income taxes on a separate return basis required a considerable amount of judgment
and use of both estimates and allocations. As of November 1, 2015, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company was
formally separated from former Parent; as such, any current income tax liabilities generated by Hewlett Packard
Enterprise will be settled by Hewlett Packard Enterprise and no longer included with tax filings of former
Parent.

We calculate our current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could
differ from the final positions reflected in our income tax returns. We will adjust our current and deferred tax
provisions based on our tax returns which are generally filed in the third or fourth quarters of the subsequent
fiscal year.

We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary

differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates
in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse.

We record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than
not to realize. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, we consider future market growth, forecasted
earnings, future sources of taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, and
prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. In the event we were to determine that it is more likely than not
that we will be unable to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future, we would increase the
valuation allowance and recognize a corresponding charge to earnings or other comprehensive income in the
period in which we make such a determination. Likewise, if we later determine that we are more likely than not
to realize the deferred tax assets, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously recognized
valuation allowance. In order for us to realize our deferred tax assets, we must be able to generate sufficient
taxable income in the jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

Our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which we have not

provided for U.S. federal taxes because we plan to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside the U.S. We plan
distributions of foreign earnings based on projected cash flow needs as well as the working capital and
long-term investment requirements of our foreign subsidiaries and our domestic operations. Based on these
assumptions, we estimate the amount we expect to indefinitely invest outside the U.S. and the amounts we
expect to distribute to the U.S. and provide for the U.S. federal taxes due on amounts expected to be
distributed to the U.S. Further, as a result of certain employment actions and capital investments we have
undertaken, income from manufacturing activities in certain jurisdictions is subject to reduced tax rates and, in
some cases, is wholly exempt from taxes for fiscal years through 2024. Material changes in our estimates of
cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements in the various jurisdictions in which we do
business could impact how future earnings are repatriated to the U.S., and our related future effective tax rate.

We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and approximately 120 other countries, and we are subject to

routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions. We believe that positions taken on our tax
returns are fully supported, but tax authorities may challenge these positions, which may not be fully sustained
on examination by the relevant tax authorities. Accordingly, our income tax provision includes amounts
intended to satisfy assessments that may result from these challenges. Determining the income tax provision
for these potential assessments and recording the related effects requires management judgments and
estimates. The amounts ultimately paid on resolution of an audit could be materially different from the amounts
previously included in our income tax provision and, therefore, could have a material impact on our income tax
provision, net income and cash flows. Our accrual for uncertain tax positions is attributable primarily to
uncertainties concerning the tax treatment of our international operations, including the allocation of income
among different jurisdictions, intercompany transactions and related interest, as well as pre-Separation income
tax liabilities of HP Inc. for which the Company is jointly and severally liable. For a further discussion on taxes
on earnings, refer to Note 8, ‘‘Taxes on Earnings’’, to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements.

Inventory

We state our inventory at the lower of cost or market on a first-in, first-out basis. We make adjustments to

reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value at the product group level for estimated excess or
obsolescence. Factors influencing these adjustments include changes in demand, technological changes,
product life-cycle and development plans, component cost trends, product pricing, physical deterioration, and
quality issues.

Business Combinations

We allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired, including in-process research

and development (‘‘IPR&D’’), liabilities assumed, and non-controlling interests in the acquiree generally based
on their fair values at the acquisition date. IPR&D is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with
an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter. When the IPR&D project is complete, it is reclassified
as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and is amortized over its estimated useful life. If an IPR&D
project is abandoned, we will record a charge for the value of the related intangible asset to our Consolidated
and Combined Statement of Earnings in the period it is abandoned. The excess of the fair value of purchase
consideration over the fair value of these assets acquired, liabilities assumed and non-controlling interests in
the acquiree is recorded as goodwill.

When determining the fair values of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and non-controlling interests in
the acquiree, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible
assets. Critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, expected future cash flows,
which includes consideration of future growth rates and margins, attrition rates, future changes in technology
and brand awareness, loyalty and position, and discount rates. Fair value estimates are based on the
assumptions management believes a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. Amounts
recorded in a business combination may change during the measurement period, which is a period not to

exceed one year from the date of acquisition, as additional information about conditions existing at the
acquisition date becomes available.

Goodwill

We review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate

the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. We are permitted to conduct a qualitative assessment
to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. We perform a
quantitative test for each of our reporting units as part of our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth
quarter of each fiscal year.

Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. As of October 31, 2017, our reporting units

were consistent with the reportable segments identified in Note 3, ‘‘Segment Information’’, to the Consolidated
and Combined Financial Statements. In the goodwill impairment test, we compare the fair value of each
reporting unit to its carrying amount. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a weighting of fair
values derived most significantly from the income approach and, to a lesser extent, the market approach.
Under the income approach, we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of
estimated future cash flows. Cash flow projections are based on management’s estimates of revenue growth
rates and operating margins, taking into consideration industry and market conditions. The discount rate used
is based on the weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business specific
characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting unit’s ability to execute on the projected cash flows.
Under the market approach, we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings
derived from comparable publicly traded companies with operating and investment characteristics similar to the
reporting unit. We weight the fair value derived from the market approach depending on the level of
comparability of these publicly traded companies to the reporting unit. When market comparables are not
meaningful or not available, we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit using only the income approach. A
significant and sustained decline in our stock price could provide evidence of a need to record a goodwill
impairment charge.

Estimating the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant
estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating
margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk adjusted discount rates, future economic and market
conditions, and the determination of appropriate comparable publicly traded companies. In addition, we make
certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to individual reporting units to
determine the carrying amount of each reporting unit.

If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount of the net assets assigned to that

reporting unit, goodwill is not impaired. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount,
goodwill is impaired. The goodwill impairment loss is measured as the excess of the reporting unit’s carrying
value over its fair value (not to exceed the total goodwill allocated to that reporting unit).

Our annual goodwill impairment analysis, which we performed as of the first day of the fourth quarter of

fiscal 2017, did not result in any impairment charges. The excess of fair value over carrying amount for our
reporting units ranged from approximately 32% for EG to approximately 37% for FS of the respective carrying
amounts.

In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the estimated fair value of our reporting units in the goodwill

impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair value of each reporting unit. Based on the
results of this hypothetical 10% decrease all of the reporting units had an excess of fair value over carrying
value.

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

Intangible Assets

We review intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances

indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of our finite-lived intangible
assets is assessed based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and
eventual disposition of the asset. If the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount, the
finite-lived intangible assets are considered to be impaired. The amount of the impairment loss, if any, is
measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value. We estimate the fair
value of finite-lived intangible assets by using an income approach or, when available and appropriate, using a
market approach.

Fair Value of Derivative Instruments

We use derivative instruments to manage a variety of risks, including risks related to foreign currency
exchange rates and interest rates. We use forwards, swaps and, at times, options to hedge certain foreign
currency and interest rate exposures. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
At October 31, 2017, the gross notional amount of our derivative portfolio was $28.3 billion. Assets and
liabilities related to derivative instruments are measured at fair value, and were $260 million and $477 million,
respectively, as of October 31, 2017.

Fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In the absence of active markets for
identical assets or liabilities, such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable
data and, in the absence of such data, internal information that is consistent with what market participants
would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date. The determination of fair value
often involves significant judgments about assumptions such as determining an appropriate discount rate that
factors in both risk and liquidity premiums, identifying the similarities and differences in market transactions,
weighting those differences accordingly and then making the appropriate adjustments to those market
transactions to reflect the risks specific to the asset or liability being valued. We generally use industry
standard valuation models to measure the fair value of our derivative positions. When prices in active markets
are not available for an identical asset or liability, we use industry standard valuation models to measure fair
value. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to present
value using market based observable inputs, including interest rate curves, Company and counterparty credit
risk, foreign currency exchange rates, and forward and spot prices.

For a further discussion of fair value measurements and derivative instruments, refer to Note 13, ‘‘Fair

Value’’ and Note 14, ‘‘Financial Instruments’’, respectively, to the Consolidated and Combined Financial
Statements.

Loss Contingencies

We are involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings including those consisting of

IP, commercial, securities, employment, employee benefits, and environmental matters, which arise in the
ordinary course of business. We record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has
been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to
determine both the probability of having incurred a liability and the estimated amount of the liability. We review
these matters at least quarterly and adjust these liabilities to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements,
rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other updated information and events, pertaining to a particular case.
Based on our experience, we believe that any damage amounts claimed in the specific litigation and
contingency matters further discussed in Note 19, ‘‘Litigation and Contingencies’’, to the Consolidated and
Combined Financial Statements are not a meaningful indicator of our potential liability. Litigation is inherently
unpredictable. However, we believe we have valid defenses with respect to legal matters pending against us.
Nevertheless, cash flows or results of operations could be materially affected in any particular period by the
resolution of one or more of these contingencies. We believe we have recorded adequate provisions for any

such matters and, as of October 31, 2017, it was not reasonably possible that a material loss had been
incurred in connection with such matters in excess of the amounts recognized in our financial statements.

ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

For a summary of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to our Consolidated and Combined

Financial Statements, see Note 1, ‘‘Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies’’, to the
Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II, which is incorporated herein by
reference.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Revenue from our international operations has historically represented, and we expect will continue to

represent, a majority of our overall net revenue. As a result, our revenue growth has been impacted, and we
expect will continue to be impacted, by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In order to provide a
framework for assessing performance excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, we present the
year-over-year percentage change in revenue on a constant currency basis, which assumes no change in
foreign currency exchange rates from the prior-year period and doesn’t adjust for any repricing or demand
impacts from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This change in revenue on a constant currency
basis is calculated as the quotient of (a) current year revenue converted to U.S. dollars using the prior-year
period’s foreign currency exchange rates divided by (b) prior-year period revenue. This information is provided
so that revenue can be viewed without the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which is
consistent with how management evaluates our revenue results and trends. This constant currency disclosure
is provided in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the year-over-year percentage change in revenue on a
GAAP basis. Other companies may calculate and define similarly labeled items differently, which may limit the
usefulness of this measure for comparative purposes.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

Fiscal 2017 compared with Fiscal 2016

In fiscal 2017, our total net revenue decreased 4.7% (decreased 4.1% on a constant currency basis).

U.S. net revenue decreased 4.1% to $9.9 billion, while net revenue from outside of the U.S. decreased 5.0% to
$19.0 billion.

From a segment perspective, the primary factors contributing to the change in our total net revenue are

summarized as follows:

•

•

EG net revenue decreased due primarily to a decline in Servers revenue from Tier-1 server sales
and a decline in Networking revenue as a result of the H3C divestiture in May 2016; and

FS net revenue increased due primarily to higher rental revenue resulting from an increase in
operating lease volume and the conversion of capital leases to operating leases in connection with
the Everett Transaction.

Fiscal 2016 compared with Fiscal 2015

In fiscal 2016, our total net revenue decreased 2.6% (flat on a constant currency basis) as compared to

fiscal 2015. U.S. net revenue increased 7.8% to $10.3 billion, while net revenue from outside of the U.S.
decreased 7.2% to $19.9 billion.

From a segment perspective, the primary factors contributing to the change in our total net revenue are

summarized as follows:

•

•

EG net revenue decreased due primarily to unfavorable currency fluctuations and the impact of the
H3C divestiture in May 2016, which primarily impacted Networking and TS; and

FS net revenue decreased due primarily to unfavorable currency fluctuations and lower asset
management activity primarily as a result of lower fixed term renewals.

Gross Margin

Fiscal 2017 compared with Fiscal 2016

Our gross margin decreased by 2.2 percentage points for fiscal 2017 as compared with fiscal 2016. From

a segment perspective, the primary factors impacting gross margin performance are summarized as follows:

•

•

EG gross margin decreased due primarily to higher commodity costs, particularly DRAM, competitive
pricing pressures, the impact of the H3C divestiture, and unfavorable currency fluctuations; and

FS gross margin decreased due primarily to lower portfolio margins resulting from the increase in
operating lease assets and the impact of a bad debt reserve release in the prior-year period.

Fiscal 2016 compared with Fiscal 2015

Our gross margin decreased by 0.1 percentage points for fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015. From a

segment perspective, the primary factors impacting gross margin performance are summarized as follows:

•

•

EG gross margin decreased due primarily to unfavorable currency fluctuations and competitive
pricing pressures; and

FS gross margin increased due to lower bad debt expense, higher margins on remarketing sales
and higher portfolio margins due to an increase in average portfolio assets.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

Operating Expenses

Research and Development

R&D expense decreased by $228 million, or 13%, in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016, due primarily

to cost reduction actions in Hewlett Packard Labs, a decline in cloud-related activities and the impact of the
H3C divestiture. This decrease was partially offset by higher expenses within EG due to recent business
acquisitions.

R&D expense increased by $38 million, or 2%, in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015, due primarily to

an increase in R&D expense in Servers, partially offset by a decrease in R&D expense in Networking due to
the H3C divestiture.

Selling, General and Administrative

SG&A expense decreased by $374 million, or 7%, for fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016, due

primarily to the impact of the H3C and MphasiS divestitures in fiscal 2016, which represented $294 million of
expenses in the prior-year period, cost reduction actions, favorable foreign currency fluctuations, and lower
variable compensation expense. This decrease was partially offset by higher expenses resulting from recent
business acquisitions.

SG&A expense increased by $238 million, or 5%, for fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015, due

primarily to increased expenses resulting from the Aruba acquisition in May 2015, partially offset by a decrease
in expenses resulting from the H3C divestiture in May 2016.

Amortization of Intangible Assets

Amortization expense increased by $49 million, or 18%, in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016, due to
the addition of intangible assets resulting from business acquisitions, partially offset by certain intangible assets
associated with prior acquisitions reaching the end of their respective amortization periods.

Amortization expense increased by $43 million, or 19%, in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015, due to
the addition of intangible assets resulting from the Aruba acquisition, partially offset by certain intangible assets
associated with prior acquisitions reaching the end of their respective amortization periods.

Restructuring Charges

Restructuring charges remained flat in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016, due primarily to continuing
charges from the restructuring plan we announced in September 2015 (the ‘‘2015 Plan’’) in connection with the
Separation, partially offset by lower charges from the multi-year restructuring plan initially announced in May
2012 (the ‘‘2012 Plan’’). As of October 31, 2017, both the 2015 Plan and the 2012 Plan are substantially
complete.

Restructuring charges increased by $220 million in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015, due primarily

to higher charges from the 2015 Plan, partially offset by lower charges from the 2012 Plan.

Transformation Costs

During the third quarter of fiscal 2017, we launched the HPE Next initiative, through which we will simplify

the organizational structure and redesign business processes. The HPE Next initiative is expected to be
implemented through fiscal 2020, during which time we expect to incur expenses for workforce reductions
(‘‘HPE Next Plan’’), to upgrade and simplify our IT infrastructure, and for other non-labor actions, partially offset
by proceeds received from real estate sales. For fiscal 2017, transformation costs of $359 million include

HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE

HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

restructuring charges related to the HPE Next Plan, program management costs and IT costs, partially offset by
a gain from the sale of real estate.

Disaster Charges

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, our facilities in Houston, Texas sustained significant damage as a
result of Hurricane Harvey. We continue to evaluate the impact of Hurricane Harvey on the business and have
filed a claim under our insurance program for property damage and other covered expenses. For fiscal 2017,
we recorded $93 million in Disaster charges, which primarily represented our deductible under the insurance
program and an asset impairment charge, in our Consolidated Statement of Earnings.

Acquisition and Other Related Charges

Acquisition and other related charges increased by $58 million in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016,

due primarily to charges resulting from the acquisitions of Nimble Storage, SimpliVity and SGI.

Acquisition and other related charges increased by $61 million in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015,

due primarily to charges resulting from the divestiture of H3C, partially offset by lower charges from the
acquisition of Aruba in fiscal 2015.

Separation Costs

Separation costs include costs resulting from the Separation in fiscal 2015 and costs resulting from the

Everett and Seattle Transactions.

Separation costs decreased by $114 million in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 due to lower costs

from the Separation, partially offset by costs from the Everett and Seattle Transactions.

Separation costs decreased by $435 million in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 due to lower costs

from the Separation, partially offset by costs from the Everett and Seattle Transactions.

Defined Benefit Plan Settlement Charges and Remeasurement (Benefit)

Defined benefit plan settlement charges and remeasurement (benefit) in fiscal 2017 represents an
adjustment to the net periodic pension benefit cost resulting from the remeasurement of certain Hewlett
Packard Enterprise pension plans due to plan separations in connection with the Everett and Seattle
Transactions.

Defined benefit plan settlement charges and remeasurement (benefit) in fiscal 2015 was related to U.S.
defined benefit plan settlement expense and net periodic benefit cost resulting from former Parent’s voluntary
lump sum program announced January 2015.

Gain on H3C and MphasiS Divestitures

The gain on these divestitures in fiscal 2016 resulted from the sale of 51% of our H3C Technologies and
China-based server, storage and technology services businesses and the sale of our equity stake in MphasiS
Limited.

Interest and Other, Net

Interest and other, net expense increased by $43 million in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016, due

primarily to higher interest expense from a higher weighted-average interest rate.

HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE

HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

Interest and other, net expense increased by $275 million in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015, due
primarily to higher interest expense from higher average borrowings, partially offset by higher interest income.

Tax Indemnification Adjustments

Tax indemnification adjustments, representing a $3 million benefit in fiscal 2017 and a $317 million charge

in fiscal 2016, resulted from the potential settlement of certain pre-Separation tax liabilities for which we share
joint and several liability with HP Inc. and for which we are partially indemnified by HP Inc. under the Tax
Matters Agreement.

Loss from Equity Interests

Loss from equity interests primarily represents our 49% interest in H3C. Loss from equity interests

decreased by $53 million in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 due to higher net income earned by H3C.
The loss is primarily the result of the amortization of our interest in the basis difference which is offset against
our share of the net income earned by H3C.

Provision for Taxes

Our effective tax rates were (60.3)%, 16.1% and (36.4)% in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our

effective tax rate generally differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due to favorable tax rates
associated with certain earnings from our operations in lower tax jurisdictions throughout the world. The
jurisdictions with favorable tax rates that had the most significant impact on our effective tax rate in the periods
presented include Puerto Rico, China and Singapore. The Company plans to reinvest earnings of these
jurisdictions indefinitely outside the U.S., and therefore have not provided for U.S. taxes on those indefinitely
reinvested earnings.

In fiscal 2017, we recorded $554 million of net income tax benefits related to items unique to the year.

These amounts primarily included $699 million of income tax benefits in connection with the Everett and Seattle
Transactions and $326 million of income tax benefits on restructuring charges, separation costs, transformation
costs, and acquisition and other related charges, the effects of which were partially offset by $473 million of
income tax charges to record valuation allowances on U.S. state deferred tax assets and $88 million of income
tax charges related to pre-Separation tax matters.

In fiscal 2016, we recorded $250 million of net income tax charges related to items unique to the year.

These amounts primarily included $714 million of income tax charges related to pre-Separation tax matters, of
which $647 million was related to the effect of the potential settlement of certain pre-Separation Hewlett-
Packard Company income tax liabilities, and $169 million of income tax charges resulting from a gain on the
H3C divestiture, the effects of which were partially offset by $509 million of income tax benefits on restructuring
charges, separation costs and acquisition and other related charges, and $124 million of income tax benefits
resulting from a gain on the MphasiS divestiture.

In fiscal 2015, we recorded $1.7 billion of net income tax benefits related to items unique to the year.

These amounts primarily included $1.8 billion of income tax benefits due to the release of valuation allowances
pertaining to certain U.S. deferred tax assets, $139 million of income tax benefits related to restructuring
charges and separation costs, and $67 million of income tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions, the
effects of which were partially offset by $486 million of income tax charges to record valuation allowances on
certain foreign deferred tax assets and $229 million of income tax charges related to state tax impacts of the
separation of deferred taxes under the Separate Return Method.

For a reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% and further

explanation of our provision for taxes, see Note 8, ‘‘Taxes on Earnings’’, to the Consolidated and Combined
Financial Statements.

Fiscal 2017 compared with Fiscal 2016

EG net revenue decreased by $1,568 million, or 5.6% (decreased 4.9% on a constant currency basis), in
fiscal 2017. The decrease was due primarily to a decline in Servers revenue as a result of a revenue decline of
$1,314 million from Tier-1 server sales and a decline in Networking as a result of the H3C divestiture in May
2016, which contributed $809 million in EG net revenue in the prior-year period, partially offset by a revenue
contribution of approximately $640 million from the acquisitions of SGI and Nimble Storage during fiscal 2017.
EG continues to experience revenue growth challenges due to market trends, including the shift of workloads to
cloud deployment models, emergence of software-defined architectures, growth in IT consumption models, and
a highly competitive pricing environment.

Servers net revenue decreased by $1,139 million, or 8%, due primarily to a decline in revenue from
industry standard servers and Mission-Critical Servers (‘‘MCS’’). The decline in industry standard servers
revenue was due primarily to lower revenue from Tier-1 server sales, partially offset by growth in core server
products, which included revenue from the recently acquired SGI business. Industry standard servers unit
volumes decreased by 13%, while average unit prices (‘‘AUPs’’) increased by 6%. The decrease in unit
volumes was a result of the volume decline in the Tier-1 server category. The increase in AUPs was
experienced in the density optimized, blades and rack product categories, partially offset by a decline in the
tower product category. MCS revenue declined due primarily to the decline in revenue from Itanium products
and NonStop solutions.

HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE

HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

Networking net revenue decreased by $309 million, or 11%, due primarily to the H3C divestiture, which

contributed $620 million of revenue in the prior-year period, partially offset by growth in the Aruba wireless local
area network (‘‘WLAN’’) and campus switching products.

Storage net revenue decreased by $91 million, or 3%, due to continued weakness in traditional storage

products and go-to-market sales execution issues. Compared to the prior-year period, revenue from traditional
storage solutions declined, while converged storage revenue increased due primarily to growth in our All-Flash
Array products, which included revenue from the recently acquired Nimble Storage business.

TS net revenue decreased by $29 million, or remained flat, due primarily to the impact of the H3C

divestiture, which represented $170 million of revenue in the prior-year period, which was largely offset by
revenue from SGI and growth in the HPE Data Center Care and HPE Proactive Care support solutions.

EG earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased by 2.5 percentage points in fiscal

2017 due to a decrease in gross margin and an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net
revenue. The gross margin decrease was due primarily to higher commodity costs, particularly DRAM, and
competitive pressures affecting Servers and Storage, the impact of the H3C divestiture, particularly in
Networking, and unfavorable currency fluctuations, which was partially offset by improved gross margin from a
lower mix of Tier-1 server sales revenue, lower variable compensation expense and a higher mix of revenue
from Aruba products. Operating expense as a percentage of net revenue increased due to the revenue decline
notwithstanding the reduction in operating expense. The decrease in operating expense was due primarily to
cost reduction actions, the impact of the H3C divestiture, which represented $279 million of expense in the
prior year, and lower variable compensation expense, which was partially offset by increased expenses as a
result of our recently acquired businesses.

Fiscal 2016 compared with Fiscal 2015

EG net revenue decreased by $732 million, or 2.6% (flat on a constant currency basis), in fiscal 2016.

The decrease in EG net revenue was due primarily to unfavorable currency fluctuations, led by the euro, and
the impact of the H3C divestiture, which impacted each of the EG business units, primarily Networking and TS.

Servers net revenue decreased by $389 million, or 3%, due to unfavorable currency fluctuations and a
decrease in unit volumes, partially offset by higher AUPs. The decrease in unit volumes was primarily in the
tower and rack product categories within industry standard servers, due to market softness in the enterprise
and small and medium business market sectors. The increase in AUPs was experienced across each of the
industry standard servers product portfolio, resulting from increased option attach activity.

Networking net revenue decreased by $43 million, or 2%, due to lower revenues resulting from the H3C

divestiture, partially offset by revenue growth in our Aruba WLAN products.

Storage net revenue increased by $55 million, or 2%, or as a result of growth in Converged Storage

solutions led by higher revenue from our 3PAR All-Flash Array products, partially offset by unfavorable
currency fluctuations and a decline in traditional storage products.

TS net revenue decreased by $355 million, or 4%, due primarily to unfavorable currency fluctuations, the

impact of the H3C divestiture and the discontinuation of support service attach revenue from hardware products
sold by former Parent. Partially offsetting the TS revenue decline was growth in HPE Data Center Care and
HPE Proactive Care support solutions.

EG earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased by 1.2 percentage points in fiscal

2016 as a result of a decrease in gross margin and an increase in operating expenses as percentage of net
revenue. The gross margin decrease was due primarily to unfavorable currency fluctuations and competitive
pricing pressures, partially offset by improved gross margins in Networking from Aruba and higher option attach

higher administrative expenses and R&D investments, partially offset by favorable currency fluctuations and the
impact of the H3C divestiture.

As a result of the Everett Transaction, during the second quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company converted
certain capital lease arrangements with the former ES segment to operating leases, which resulted in higher
net equipment under operating leases. Additionally, leasing transactions with the former ES segment were
treated as intercompany leases and eliminated in consolidation until the close of the transaction on April 1,
2017, when they became third party leases held with DXC.

Fiscal 2017 compared with Fiscal 2016

FS net revenue increased by $412 million, or 12.9% (increased 13.1% on a constant currency basis), in

fiscal 2017 due primarily to higher rental revenue resulting from an increase in operating lease volume and the
conversion of capital leases to operating leases in connection with the Everett Transaction, along with higher
lease buyout revenue due primarily to a large customer buyout transaction in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.

FS earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased by 2.1 percentage points in fiscal
2017 due to a decrease in gross margin, partially offset by a decrease in operating expense as a percentage of
net revenue. The decrease in gross margin was due primarily to lower portfolio margins resulting from the
increase in operating lease assets and the impact of a bad debt reserve release in the prior-year period,
partially offset by higher margins on lease buyout activity. Operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue
decreased primarily as a result of the net revenue increase, as total operating expenses increased by only 3%
from the prior-year period.

Fiscal 2016 compared with Fiscal 2015

FS net revenue decreased by $26 million, or 0.8% (increased 2.3% on a constant currency basis), in

fiscal 2016 due primarily to unfavorable currency fluctuations and lower asset management activity, primarily as
a result of lower fixed-term renewals, partially offset by higher portfolio revenue due to an increase in average
portfolio assets.

FS earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased by 0.4 percentage points in fiscal
2016 due primarily to an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue, partially offset by an
increase in gross margin. The increase in gross margin was the result of lower bad debt expense, higher
margins on remarketing sales and higher portfolio margins due to an increase in average portfolio assets,
partially offset by lower margins on lease extensions and unfavorable currency fluctuations. Operating
expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased primarily as a result of higher IT expenses.

Financing volume, which represents the amount of financing provided to customers for equipment and
related software and services, including intercompany activity, decreased 6.1% in fiscal 2017 and decreased
0.4% in fiscal 2016. The decrease in fiscal 2017 was primarily driven by lower financing volume associated
with third-party and HPE product sales and related service offerings, along with unfavorable currency
fluctuations. The decrease in fiscal 2016 was driven by unfavorable currency fluctuations, partially offset by
higher financing volume associated with third-party product sales and related services offerings.

Portfolio Assets and Ratios

The FS business model is asset intensive and uses certain internal metrics to measure its performance

against other financial services companies, including a segment balance sheet that is derived from our internal
management reporting system. The accounting policies used to derive FS amounts are substantially the same
as those used by the Company. However, intercompany loans and certain accounts that are reflected in the
segment balances are eliminated in our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements.

The portfolio assets and ratios derived from the segment balance sheets for FS were as follows:

Debt benefiting FS consists of intercompany equity that is treated as debt for segment reporting purposes,
intercompany debt and borrowing- and funding-related activity associated with FS and its subsidiaries.
Debt benefiting FS totaled $11.2 billion and $11.4 billion at October 31, 2017 and October 31, 2016,
respectively, and was determined by applying an assumed debt-to-equity ratio, which management
believes to be comparable to that of other similar financing companies. FS equity at both October 31,
2017 and October 31, 2016 was $1.6 billion.

The decrease in financing receivables, gross and the corresponding increase in net equipment under
operating leases during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2017 is due primarily to the conversion of capital
leases to operating leases related to the Everett Transaction. Intercompany leases decreased during the fiscal

year ended October 31, 2017 as a result of the Everett Transaction, as leasing transactions with the former ES
segment were treated as intercompany leases and eliminated in consolidation until the close of the transaction.
As of April 1, 2017, these leases became third party leases held with DXC.

At October 31, 2017 and 2016, FS net cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were

$873 million and $607 million, respectively.

Net portfolio assets at October 31, 2017 increased 0.6% from October 31, 2016. The increase generally

resulted from favorable currency fluctuations led by strength in the euro, partially offset by portfolio runoff in
excess of new financing volume.

FS bad debt expense includes charges to reserves for sales-type, direct-financing and operating leases.
FS recorded net bad debt expense of $45 million, $23 million and $46 million in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015,
respectively.

Effective at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2017, and prior to the completion of the Everett

Transaction, we transferred the historical net revenue and operating profit related to the previously divested
MphasiS product group from the former ES segment to the Corporate Investments segment.

Net revenue in the current and prior periods includes IP-related royalty revenue. Net revenue in the

prior-year periods primarily represents revenue from the MphasiS product group, which was divested in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, as well as residual activity from certain cloud-related incubation projects.
Corporate Investments net revenue decreased by 99% in fiscal 2017, as compared to the prior-year period,
due to the absence of revenue from MphasiS, and by 14% in fiscal 2016, as compared to the prior-year period,
due to a decline in revenue from MphasiS.

Corporate Investments loss from operations decreased by 41% in fiscal 2017 and 11% in fiscal 2016, as
compared to the prior-year periods, respectively. The decline in loss from operations for fiscal 2017 was due to
lower expenses in HP labs and certain cloud-related incubation activities, as well as the absence of operating
expenses related to MphasiS. The decline in loss from operations for fiscal 2016 was due primarily to lower
expenses associated with cloud-related incubation activities and HP Labs.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

We use cash generated by operations as our primary source of liquidity. We believe that internally

generated cash flows will be generally sufficient to support our operating businesses, capital expenditures,
acquisitions, restructuring activities, transformation costs, remaining separation costs, maturing debt, interest
payments, income tax payments, in addition to any future investments and any future share repurchases, and
future stockholder dividend payments. We expect to supplement this short-term liquidity, if necessary, by
accessing the capital markets, issuing commercial paper, and borrowing under credit facilities made available
by various domestic and foreign financial institutions. However, our access to capital markets may be

|60

HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE

HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

constrained and our cost of borrowing may increase under certain business, market and economic conditions.
Our liquidity is subject to various risks including the risks identified in the section entitled ‘‘Risk Factors’’ in
Item 1A and market risks identified in the section entitled ‘‘Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about
Market Risk’’ in Item 7A, each of which is incorporated herein by reference.

Our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world, with a substantial amount held

outside of the U.S. We utilize a variety of planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our
worldwide cash is available when and where it is needed. Our cash position is strong and we expect that our
cash balances, anticipated cash flow generated from operations and access to capital markets will be sufficient
to cover our expected near-term cash outlays.

Amounts held outside of the U.S. are generally utilized to support non-U.S. liquidity needs, although a
portion of those amounts may, from time to time, be subject to short-term intercompany loans into the U.S.
Most of the amounts held outside of the U.S. could be repatriated to the U.S. but, under current law, some
would be subject to U.S. federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. Repatriation of some foreign
earnings is restricted by local law. Except for foreign earnings that are considered indefinitely reinvested
outside of the U.S., we have provided for the U.S. federal tax liability on these earnings for financial statement
purposes. Repatriation could result in additional income tax payments in future years, including potentially with
respect to U.S. tax reform. Where local restrictions prevent an efficient intercompany transfer of funds, our
intent is to keep cash balances outside of the U.S. and to meet liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows,
external borrowings, or both. We do not expect restrictions or potential taxes incurred on repatriation of
amounts held outside of the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition or results
of operations.

On October 13, 2015, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program with a $3.0 billion

authorization, which was refreshed with additional share repurchase authorizations of $3.0 billion and
$5.0 billion on May 24, 2016 and October 16, 2017, respectively. As of October 31, 2017, we had a remaining
authorization of $5.8 billion for future share repurchases. The number of shares that we repurchase under the
share repurchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including share price, liquidity and other
market conditions, our ongoing capital allocation planning, levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for
cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic or business conditions, and board and management
discretion. Additionally, our share repurchase activity, if any, during any particular period may fluctuate. We
may commence, accelerate, suspend, delay, or discontinue any share repurchase activity at any time, without
notice. This program does not have a specific expiration date.

In fiscal 2017, we repurchased an aggregate of $2.6 billion of our stock as a result of our share

repurchase program. For more information on our share repurchase program, refer to Note 17, ‘‘Stockholders’
Equity’’, to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by
reference.

On April 1, 2017, we completed the Everett Transaction. In connection with this transaction, we received

a $3.0 billion cash dividend payment from Everett. Everett funded the cash dividend payment from the issuance
of approximately $3.5 billion of aggregate debt. The debt was retained by Everett at the close of the
transaction.

On September 1, 2017, we completed the Seattle Transaction. In connection with this transaction, we

received a $2.5 billion cash dividend payment from Seattle. Seattle funded the cash dividend payment from the
issuance of $2.6 billion of debt. The debt was retained by Seattle at the close of the transaction.

During fiscal 2017, in connection with the Everett and Seattle Transactions, we transferred net cash of

$711 million and $227 million to DXC and Micro Focus, respectively.

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $4.1 billion for fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal
2016. The decrease was due primarily to a payment of $1.9 billion for pension funding in connection with the
Everett Transaction and lower net earnings, partially offset by improvements in working capital management.
Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $1.3 billion for fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015
due primarily to the impact of improvements in the cash conversion cycle and lower separation payments in
fiscal 2016.

Days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable (‘‘DSO’’) measures the average number of days our
receivables are outstanding. DSO is calculated by dividing ending accounts receivable, net of allowance for
doubtful accounts, by a 90-day average of net revenue. For fiscal 2017, as compared to the prior-year period,
the decrease in DSO was due primarily to lower aged accounts receivables, a reduction in accounts
receivables of recent acquisitions and improvements in credit and collections. For fiscal 2016, as compared to
the prior-year period, the decrease in DSO was due to favorable early payment linearity and strong credit and
collections management.

Days of supply in inventory (‘‘DOS’’) measures the average number of days from procurement to sale of

our product. DOS is calculated by dividing ending inventory by a 90-day average of cost of goods sold. For
fiscal 2017, as compared to the prior-year period, the increase in DOS was due primarily to higher inventory
resulting from increases in memory component costs and an increase in inventory as a result of recent

|62

HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE

HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

acquisitions. For fiscal 2016, as compared to the prior-year period, the decrease in DOS was due to lower
inventory to support expected service levels, including key commodity buffer management.

Days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable (‘‘DPO’’) measures the average number of days our

accounts payable balances are outstanding. DPO is calculated by dividing ending accounts payable by a
90-day average of cost of goods sold. For fiscal 2017, as compared to the prior-year period, the increase in
DPO was primarily the result of an extension of payment terms with our product suppliers. For fiscal 2016, as
compared to the prior-year period, the increase in DPO was due primarily to an extension of payment terms
with our product suppliers and favorable purchasing linearity.

The cash conversion cycle is the sum of DSO and DOS, less DPO. Items which may cause the cash

conversion cycle in a particular period to differ include, but are not limited to, changes in business mix,
changes in payment terms (including extended payment terms from suppliers), the extent of receivables
factoring, seasonal trends, the timing of revenue recognition and inventory purchases within the period, and
acquisition activity.

Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities was $4.9 billion in fiscal 2017 due primarily to $2.5 billion of

investments in property, plant and equipment, net of proceeds from sales, and payments of $2.2 billion in
connection with business acquisitions. Net cash provided by investing activities increased by $5.8 billion in
fiscal 2016 as compared to the prior-year period, due primarily to net proceeds of $3.2 billion from business
divestitures and a decrease of $2.6 billion in cash payments made in connection with business acquisitions.

Financing Activities

Net cash provided by financing activities was $0.6 billion in fiscal 2017 due primarily to a $3.0 billion cash

dividend payment from Everett, a $2.5 billion cash dividend payment from Seattle and $2.3 billion of cash
proceeds from the issuance of debt, partially offset by $3.8 billion of debt redemption payments and $3.0 billion
of cash utilization for repurchases of common stock and dividend payments. Net cash used in financing
activities was $2.2 billion in fiscal 2016 due primarily to cash utilization for repurchases of common stock and
dividend payments. Cash flow from financing activities for fiscal 2015 primarily represents net transfers from
former Parent and net payments on debt. As cash and the financing of our operations during that period has
historically been managed by former Parent, the components of net transfers from former Parent include cash
transfers to us from former Parent and payments by former Parent to settle our obligations. These transactions
are considered to be effectively settled for cash at the time the transaction is recorded.

On April 28, 2017, we used a portion of the $3.0 billion cash dividend received from Everett to redeem

$1.5 billion face value of the 2.450% Senior Notes with an original maturity date of October 5, 2017. A

proportional amount of unamortized discount and debt issuance costs have been allocated to the retired debt.
These costs, along with the redemption price of $1.5 billion, resulted in an immaterial loss from a partial
retirement of Senior Notes.

On September 20, 2017, we completed our debt offering of $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of

2.100% notes due in 2019. The proceeds from this issuance were used to fund the repayment of the remaining
$750 million outstanding principal amount of our 2.450% Senior Notes with an original maturity of October 5,
2017, and the repayment of the $350 million outstanding principal amount of our floating rate Senior Notes with
an original maturity of October 5, 2017.

Outstanding borrowings decreased to $14.0 billion as of October 31, 2017, as compared to $15.7 billion
at October 31, 2016, due primarily to the net redemption of $1.5 billion face value of the Senior Notes. During
fiscal 2017, we issued $11.3 billion and repaid $11.2 billion of commercial paper.

There are two tranches of Senior Notes scheduled to mature in October 2018 with an aggregate face

value of $2.9 billion. We expect to refinance these notes. For more information on our borrowings, see
Note 15, ‘‘Borrowings’’, to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in Item 8, which is
incorporated herein by reference.

In connection with our separation capitalization plan, on October 9, 2015 we completed our offering of

$14.6 billion of aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes. As intended, net proceeds of $14.5 billion from the
Senior Notes offering were distributed to HP Inc. On December 30, 2016, we exchanged new registered Notes
for all of the outstanding $14.6 billion of unregistered Senior Notes. The terms of the new registered Notes in
the exchange offer are substantially identical to the terms of the previously unregistered Senior Notes, except
that the new Notes are registered under the Securities Act, and certain transfer restrictions, registration rights
and additional interest provisions relating to the outstanding Senior Notes do not apply to the new Notes.

Our weighted-average interest rate reflects the effective interest rate on our borrowings prevailing during
the period and reflects the effect of interest rate swaps. For more information on our interest rate swaps, see
Note 14, ‘‘Financial Instruments’’, to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in Item 8, which is
incorporated herein by reference.

Revolving Credit Facility

On November 1, 2015, we entered into a revolving credit facility (the ‘‘Credit Agreement’’), together with

the lenders named therein, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (‘‘JPMorgan’’), as co-administrative agent and
administrative processing agent, and Citibank, N.A., as co-administrative agent, providing for a senior,
unsecured revolving credit facility with aggregate lending commitments of $4.0 billion. Loans under the
revolving credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes. Commitments under the Credit Agreement
are available for a period of five years, which period may be extended, subject to the satisfaction of certain
conditions, by up to two, one-year periods. Commitment fees, interest rates and other terms of borrowing under
the credit facility vary based on Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s external credit rating. As of October 31, 2017 and
2016, no borrowings were outstanding under the Credit Agreement.

Amounts represent the principal cash payments relating to our long-term debt and do not include fair
value adjustments, discounts or premiums and debt issuance costs.
Amounts represent the expected interest payments relating to our long-term debt. We have outstanding
interest rate swap agreements accounted for as fair value hedges that have the economic effect of
changing fixed interest rates associated with some of our U.S. Dollar Senior Notes to variable interest
rates. The impact of our outstanding interest rate swaps at October 31, 2017 was factored into the
calculation of the future interest payments on long-term debt.
Purchase obligations and other include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable
and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be
purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction, as
well as settlements that we have reached with third parties, requiring us to pay determined amounts over
a specific period of time. These purchase obligations are related principally to software maintenance and
support services and other items. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without
penalty. Purchase obligations also exclude open purchase orders that are routine arrangements entered
into in the ordinary course of business as they are difficult to quantify in a meaningful way. Even though
open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow us the
option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust terms based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods
or performance of services.
In fiscal 2018, we anticipate making contributions of $180 million to our non-U.S. pension plans. Our
policy is to fund pension plans so that we meet at least the minimum contribution requirements, as
established by local government, funding and taxing authorities. Expected contributions and payments to
our pension and post-retirement benefit plans are excluded from the contractual obligations table because
they do not represent contractual cash outflows, as they are dependent on numerous factors which may
result in a wide range of outcomes. For more information on our retirement and post-retirement benefit
plans, see Note 6, ‘‘Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans’’, to the Consolidated and Combined
Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.
As of October 31, 2017 we expect future cash payments of approximately $1.2 billion in connection with
our approved restructuring plans, which includes $0.7 billion expected to be paid in fiscal 2018 and
$0.5 billion expected to be paid through fiscal 2021. Payments for restructuring activities have been
excluded from the contractual obligations table, because they do not represent contractual cash outflows
and there is uncertainty as to the timing of these payments. For more information on our restructuring
activities, see Note 4, ‘‘Restructuring’’, and Note 5, ‘‘HPE Next’’, to the Consolidated and Combined
Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.

As of October 31, 2017, we had approximately $4.4 billion of recorded liabilities and related interest and
penalties pertaining to uncertain tax positions. These liabilities and related interest and penalties include
$125 million expected to be paid within one year. For the remaining amount, we are unable to make a
reasonable estimate as to when cash settlement with the tax authorities might occur due to the
uncertainties related to these tax matters. Payments of these obligations would result from settlements
with taxing authorities. For more information on our uncertain tax positions, see Note 8, ‘‘Taxes on
Earnings’’, to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated
herein by reference.
In connection with the Separation, the Company entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement
with HP Inc., effective November 1, 2015, whereby the Company agreed to indemnify HP Inc., each of its
subsidiaries and each of their respective directors, officers and employees from and against all liabilities
relating to, arising out of or resulting from, among other matters, the liabilities allocated to the Company
as part of the Separation. HP Inc. similarly agreed to indemnify the Company, each of its subsidiaries and
each of their respective directors, officers and employees from and against all claims and liabilities
relating to, arising out of or resulting from, among other matters, the liabilities allocated to HP Inc. as part
of the Separation. Additionally, in connection with the Separation, the Company entered into a Tax
Matters Agreement (the ‘‘Tax Matters Agreement’’) with HP Inc., effective November 1, 2015, that governs
the rights and obligations of the Company and HP Inc. for certain pre-Separation tax liabilities. The Tax
Matters Agreement provides that the Company and HP Inc. will share certain pre-Separation income tax
liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to the Company and HP Inc.’s U.S. and
certain non-U.S. income tax returns. For more information on our general cross-indemnification, Tax
Matters Agreement and other income tax matters with HP Inc., see Note 20, ‘‘Guarantees,
Indemnifications and Warranties’’, to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in Item 8,
which is incorporated herein by reference.
In connection with the Everett and Seattle Transactions, the Company entered into a Separation and
Distribution Agreement with each of DXC, effective May 24, 2016, and Seattle, effective September 7,
2016, whereby DXC and Seattle, as applicable, agreed to indemnify HPE, each of its subsidiaries and
each of their respective directors, officers and employees from and against all losses relating to, arising
out of or resulting from, among other matters, the liabilities allocated to DXC and Seattle as part of the
Everett Transaction and Seattle Transaction, respectively. HPE similarly agreed to indemnify DXC and
Seattle, each of their subsidiaries and each of their respective directors, officers and employees from and
against all losses relating to, arising out of or resulting from, among other matters, the liabilities allocated
to the Company as part of the Everett Transaction and Seattle Transaction, respectively. Additionally, in
connection with the Everett and Seattle Transactions, HPE entered into a Tax Matters Agreement with
DXC and affiliates, effective March 31, 2017, (the ‘‘DXC Tax Matters Agreement’’), and Micro Focus and
affiliates, effective September 1, 2017, (the ‘‘Micro Focus Tax Matters Agreement’’), that governs the
rights and obligations of HPE and DXC or Micro Focus, as applicable, for certain pre-divestiture tax
liabilities and tax receivables. Each of the DXC Tax Matters Agreement and Micro Focus Tax Matters
Agreement generally provides that HPE will be responsible for pre-divestiture tax liabilities and will be
entitled to pre-divestiture tax receivables that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to HPE and
DXC’s, or Micro Focus’, as applicable, U.S. and certain non-U.S. tax returns. In certain jurisdictions, HPE
and DXC, or Micro Focus, as applicable, have joint and several liability for past income tax liabilities and
accordingly, HPE could be legally liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities and required to make
additional tax payments.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

As part of our ongoing business, we have not participated in transactions that generate material
relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as
structured finance or special purpose entities, established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet
arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.

We have third-party revolving short-term financing arrangements intended to facilitate the working capital

requirements of certain customers. For more information on our third-party revolving short-term financing
arrangements, see Note 9, ‘‘Balance Sheet Details’’, to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements

HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE

ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

In the normal course of business, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate

risks that could impact our financial position and results of operations. Our risk management strategy with
respect to these market risks may include the use of derivative financial instruments. We use derivative
contracts only to manage existing underlying exposures. Accordingly, we do not use derivative contracts for
speculative purposes. Our risks, risk management strategy and a sensitivity analysis estimating the effects of
changes in fair value for each of these exposures is outlined below.

Actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses based on changes

in the timing and amount of foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate movements and our actual
exposures and derivatives in place at the time of the change, as well as the effectiveness of the derivative to
hedge the related exposure.

Foreign currency exchange rate risk

We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments, anticipated
sales, anticipated purchases, and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
We transact business in approximately 60 currencies worldwide, of which the most significant foreign
currencies to our operations for fiscal 2017 were the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, and Chinese yuan
(renminbi). For most currencies, we are a net receiver of the foreign currency and therefore benefit from a
weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar relative to the foreign currency. Even
where we are a net receiver of the foreign currency, a weaker U.S. dollar may adversely affect certain expense
figures, if taken alone.

We use a combination of forward contracts and, from time to time, options designated as cash flow

hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our forecasted net revenue and,
to a lesser extent, cost of sales, operating expenses, and intercompany loans denominated in currencies other
than the U.S. dollar. In addition, when debt is denominated in a foreign currency, we may use swaps to
exchange the foreign currency principal and interest obligations for U.S. dollar-denominated amounts to
manage the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We also use other derivatives not
designated as hedging instruments, consisting primarily of forward contracts, to hedge foreign currency balance
sheet exposures. Alternatively, we may choose not to hedge the risk associated with our foreign currency
exposures, primarily if such exposure acts as a natural hedge for offsetting amounts denominated in the same
currency or if the currency is too difficult or too expensive to hedge.

We have performed sensitivity analyses as of October 31, 2017 and 2016, using a modeling technique

that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in the levels of
foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar, with all other variables held constant. The analyses
cover all of our foreign currency derivative contracts offset by underlying exposures. The foreign currency
exchange rates we used in performing the sensitivity analysis were based on market rates in effect at
October 31, 2017 and 2016. The sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in
foreign currency exchange rates would result in a foreign exchange fair value loss of $39 million and
$47 million at October 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Interest rate risk

We also are exposed to interest rate risk related to debt we have issued and our investment portfolio and

financing receivables. We issue long-term debt in either U.S. dollars or foreign currencies based on market
conditions at the time of financing.

We often use interest rate and/or currency swaps to modify the market risk exposures in connection with
the debt to achieve U.S. dollar LIBOR-based floating interest expense. The swap transactions generally involve
the exchange of fixed for floating interest payments. However, we may choose not to swap fixed for floating
interest payments or may terminate a previously executed swap if we believe a larger proportion of fixed-rate
debt would be beneficial.

In order to hedge the fair value of certain fixed-rate investments, we may enter into interest rate swaps
that convert fixed interest returns into variable interest returns. We may use cash flow hedges to hedge the
variability of LIBOR-based interest income received on certain variable-rate investments, by entering into
interest rate swaps that convert variable rate interest returns into fixed-rate interest returns.

We have performed sensitivity analyses as of October 31, 2017 and 2016, using a modeling technique

that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in the levels of
interest rates across the entire yield curve, with all other variables held constant. The analyses cover our debt,
investments, financing receivables, and interest rate swaps. The analyses use actual or approximate maturities
for the debt, investments, financing receivables, and interest rate swaps. The discount rates used were based
on the market interest rates in effect at October 31, 2017 and 2016. The sensitivity analyses indicated that a
hypothetical 10% adverse movement in interest rates would result in a loss in the fair values of our debt,
investments and financing receivables, net of interest rate swaps, of $43 million and $39 million at October 31,
2017 and 2016, respectively.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company

and subsidiaries (the ‘‘Company’’) as of October 31, 2017 and 2016, and the related consolidated and
combined statements of earnings, comprehensive income, cash flows, and stockholders’ equity for each of the
three years in the period ended October 31, 2017. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight

Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the

consolidated financial position of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company and subsidiaries at October 31, 2017
and 2016, and the consolidated and combined results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended October 31, 2017, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial
reporting as of October 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our
report dated December 15, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company

We have audited Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial

reporting as of October 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the
COSO criteria). Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company and subsidiary’s management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control
over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight

Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing
the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable

assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of
the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect

misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects,

effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2017, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight

Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company and
subsidiaries as of October 31, 2017 and 2016, and the related consolidated and combined statements of
earnings, comprehensive income, cash flows and stockholders’ equity for each of the three years in the period
ended October 31, 2017 of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company and subsidiaries and our report dated
December 15, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate

internal control over financial reporting for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles. Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of Hewlett Packard Enterprise;
(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of
Hewlett Packard Enterprise are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of Hewlett Packard Enterprise; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s assets that could have
a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect

misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management assessed the effectiveness of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s

internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2017, utilizing the criteria set forth by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework
(2013 framework). Based on the assessment by Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management, we determined
that Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of October 31, 2017.
The effectiveness of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s internal control over financial reporting as of October 31,
2017 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s independent registered public
accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears on page 62 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, in connection with the HPE Next initiative, the Company determined that
certain assets met the criteria to be classified as Assets held for sale. The Company expects these assets to be sold
within the next twelve months.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company adopted ASU 2015-03, which simplifies the presentation of debt
issuance costs by requiring debt issuance costs to be presented as a deduction from the corresponding debt liability
rather than an asset that is amortized. The Company adopted the standard retrospectively for the prior period
presented.

Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements

Note 1: Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Background

Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (‘‘we’’, ‘‘us’’, ‘‘our’’, ‘‘Hewlett Packard Enterprise’’, ‘‘HPE’’, or ‘‘the

Company’’) is an industry leading technology company that enables customers to go further, faster. With a
deep and comprehensive portfolio, spanning the cloud to the data center to the intelligent edge, its technology
and services help customers around the world make better business outcomes. Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s
customers range from small- and medium-sized businesses (‘‘SMBs’’) to large global enterprises.

Former Parent Separation Transaction

On November 1, 2015, the Company became an independent publicly-traded company through a pro rata
distribution by HP Inc. (‘‘former Parent’’ or ‘‘HPI’’), formerly known as Hewlett-Packard Company (‘‘HP Co.’’), of
100% of the outstanding shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company to HP Inc.’s stockholders (the
‘‘Separation’’). Each HP Inc. stockholder of record received one share of Hewlett Packard Enterprise common
stock for each share of HP Inc. common stock held on the record date. Approximately 1.8 billion shares of
Hewlett Packard Enterprise common stock were distributed on November 1, 2015 to HP Inc. stockholders. In
connection with the Separation, Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s common stock began trading ‘‘regular-way’’ under
the ticker symbol ‘‘HPE’’ on the New York Stock Exchange on November 2, 2015.

In connection with the Separation, the Company entered into a Tax Matters Agreement with former
Parent, which resulted in the indemnification of certain pre-Separation tax liabilities. During the fiscal year
ended October 31, 2016, Separation-related adjustments totaling $1.2 billion were recorded in stockholders’
equity. Separation-related adjustments to equity primarily reflected the impact of the income tax indemnification
and the transfer of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities between former Parent and the Company. See
Note 20, ‘‘Guarantees, Indemnifications and Warranties’’, for a full description of the Tax Matters Agreement.

Enterprise Services Separation Transaction

On April 1, 2017, HPE completed the separation and merger of its Enterprise Services business with

Computer Sciences Corporation (‘‘CSC’’) (collectively, the ‘‘Everett Transaction’’). The Everett Transaction was
accomplished by a series of transactions among CSC, HPE, Everett SpinCo, Inc. (a wholly-owned subsidiary of
HPE) (‘‘Everett’’), and New Everett Merger Sub Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Everett (‘‘Merger Sub’’). HPE
transferred its Enterprise Services business to Everett and distributed all of the shares of Everett to HPE
stockholders. HPE stockholders received 0.085904 shares of common stock in the new company for every one
share of HPE common stock held at the close of business on the record date. Following the distribution, the
Merger Sub merged with and into CSC. At the time of the merger, Everett changed its name to DXC
Technology Company (‘‘DXC’’).

In connection with the Everett Transaction, Everett borrowed an aggregate principal amount of

approximately $3.5 billion which consisted of a term loan facility in the principal amount of $2.0 billion and
Senior Notes in the principal amount of $1.5 billion. The proceeds from these arrangements were used to fund
a $3.0 billion cash dividend payment from Everett to HPE and the remaining approximately $0.5 billion was
retained by Everett. This debt was retained by Everett.

In connection with the Everett Transaction, HPE and Everett and, in some cases, CSC, entered into

several agreements that will govern the relationship between the parties going forward, including an Employee
Matters Agreement, a Tax Matters Agreement, an Intellectual Property Matters Agreement, a Transition
Services Agreement, and a Real Estate Matters Agreement. For more information on the impact of these
agreements, see Note 2, ‘‘Discontinued Operations’’, Note 6, ‘‘Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans’’,
Note 8, ‘‘Taxes on Earnings’’, Note 19, ‘‘Litigation and Contingencies’’, and Note 20, ‘‘Guarantees,
Indemnifications and Warranties’’.

Software Segment Separation Transaction

On September 1, 2017, HPE completed the separation and merger of its Software business segment with
Micro Focus International plc (‘‘Micro Focus’’) (collectively, the ‘‘Seattle Transaction’’). The Seattle Transaction
was accomplished by a series of transactions among HPE, Micro Focus, Seattle SpinCo, Inc. (a wholly-owned
subsidiary of HPE) (‘‘Seattle’’), and Seattle MergerSub, Inc., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Micro Focus
(‘‘Merger Sub’’). HPE transferred its Software business segment to Seattle and distributed all of the shares of
Seattle to HPE stockholders. HPE stockholders received 0.13732611 American Depository Shares (‘‘Micro
Focus ADSs’’) in the new company, each of which represents one ordinary share of Micro Focus, for every one
share of HPE common stock held at the close of business on the record date. Following the share distribution,
the Merger Sub merged with and into Seattle.

In connection with the Seattle Transaction, during the third quarter of fiscal 2017, Seattle SpinCo, Inc.
entered into a term loan facility in the principal amount of $2.6 billion. Just prior to the September 1, 2017
spin-off of Seattle, the proceeds from the term loan were used to fund a $2.5 billion dividend payment from
Seattle to HPE per the terms of the merger agreement, and to pay expenses associated with the borrowing.
This debt was retained by Seattle.

In connection with the Seattle Transaction, HPE and Seattle and, in some cases, Micro Focus, entered

into several agreements that will govern the relationship between the parties going forward, including an
Employee Matters Agreement, a Tax Matters Agreement, an Intellectual Property Matters Agreement, a
Transition Services Agreement, and a Real Estate Matters Agreement. For more information on the impact of
these agreements, see Note 2, ‘‘Discontinued Operations’’, Note 6, ‘‘Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit
Plans’’, Note 8, ‘‘Taxes on Earnings’’, Note 19, ‘‘Litigation and Contingencies’’, and Note 20, ‘‘Guarantees,
Indemnifications and Warranties’’.

HPE Next

During the third quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company launched an initiative called HPE Next, through

which it will simplify the organizational structure and redesign business processes. The HPE Next initiative is
expected to be implemented through fiscal 2020. During this time, the Company expects to incur expenses for
workforce reductions, to upgrade and simplify its IT infrastructure, and for other non-labor actions. These costs
will be partially offset by gains from real estate sales, all of which will be recorded within Transformation costs
in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. For more details on the HPE Next initiative and Transformation
costs, see Note 5, ‘‘HPE Next’’.

Basis of Presentation

Prior to October 31, 2015, the Combined Financial Statements were derived from the Consolidated

Financial Statements and accounting records of former Parent, as if the Company was operating on a
standalone basis during the periods presented. From and after October 31, 2015, substantially all of the assets
and liabilities and operations of the Company were transferred from former Parent to the Company, and the
Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements included the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries in accordance with the separation agreement for the transfer from former Parent to the Company.
These Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements of the Company were prepared in accordance with
United States (‘‘U.S.’’) Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (‘‘GAAP’’).

Prior to October 31, 2015, the Combined and Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive

Income of the Company reflect allocations of general corporate expenses from former Parent including, but not
limited to, executive management, finance, legal, information technology, employee benefits administration,
treasury, risk management, procurement, and other shared services. These allocations were made on a direct
usage basis when identifiable, with the remainder allocated on the basis of revenue, expenses, headcount, or
other relevant measures. Management of the Company and former Parent consider these allocations to be a

Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1: Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

reasonable reflection of the utilization of services by, or the benefits provided to, the Company. The allocations
may not, however, reflect the expense the Company would have incurred as a standalone company for the
periods presented. Actual costs that may have been incurred if the Company had been a standalone company
would depend on a number of factors, including the chosen organizational structure, what functions were
outsourced or performed by employees and strategic decisions made in areas such as information technology
and infrastructure.

Former Parent maintained various benefit and stock-based compensation plans at a corporate level and

other benefit plans at a subsidiary level. The Company’s employees participated in those programs and a
portion of the cost of those plans was included in the Company’s Consolidated and Combined Financial
Statements. See Note 6, ‘‘Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans’’, and Note 7, ‘‘Stock-based
Compensation’’, for a further description.

The historical results of operations and financial position of both Everett and Seattle are reported as
discontinued operations in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Earnings and the Consolidated
Balance Sheets, respectively. The historical information in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated and
Combined Financial Statements has been restated to reflect the effects of the Everett Transaction and the
Seattle Transaction. For further information on discontinued operations, see Note 2, ‘‘Discontinued Operations’’.

Principles of Consolidation and Combination

The accompanying Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements include the accounts of the

Company and other subsidiaries and affiliates in which the Company has a controlling financial interest or is
the primary beneficiary. All intercompany transactions and accounts within the consolidated and combined
businesses of the Company have been eliminated.

Prior to the Separation, intercompany transactions between the Company and former Parent are

considered to be effectively settled in the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements at the time the
transaction was recorded. The total net effect of the settlement of these intercompany transactions is reflected
in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Cash Flows within financing activities.

The Company accounts for investments in companies over which it has the ability to exercise significant

influence but does not hold a controlling interest under the equity method of accounting, and the Company
records its proportionate share of income or losses in Loss from equity interests in the Consolidated and
Combined Statements of Earnings.

Non-controlling interests are presented as a separate component within Total stockholders’ equity in the

Consolidated Balance Sheets. Net earnings attributable to non-controlling interests are recorded within Interest
and other, net in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Earnings and are not presented separately, as
they were not material for any period presented.

Segment Realignment

The Company has implemented certain segment and business unit realignments in order to align its

segment financial reporting more closely with its current business structure. Reclassifications of certain prior
year segment and business unit financial information have been made to conform to the current-year
presentation. None of the changes impact the Company’s previously reported consolidated net revenue,
earnings from operations, net earnings or net earnings per share (‘‘EPS’’). See Note 3, ‘‘Segment Information’’,
for a further discussion of the Company’s segment realignment.

HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1: Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Company’s Consolidated and Combined
Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.

Foreign Currency Translation

The Company predominately uses the U.S. dollar as its functional currency. Assets and liabilities

denominated in non-U.S. currencies are remeasured into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates for monetary
assets and liabilities and at historical exchange rates for non-monetary assets and liabilities. Net revenue, costs
and expenses denominated in non-U.S. currencies are recorded in U.S. dollars at the average rates of
exchange prevailing during the period. The Company includes gains or losses from foreign currency
remeasurement in Interest and other, net in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Earnings and gains
and losses from cash flow hedges in Net revenue as the hedged revenue is recognized. Certain non-U.S.
subsidiaries designate the local currency as their functional currency, and the Company records the translation
of their assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars at the balance sheet date as translation adjustments and includes
them as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The
effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents was not material for any of the fiscal
years presented.

Former Parent Company Investment

Former Parent company investment in Consolidated and Combined Statements of Stockholders’ Equity

represents former Parent’s historical investment in the Company, the net effect of transactions with and
allocations from former Parent and the Company’s accumulated earnings. See Note 16, ‘‘Related Party
Transactions and former Parent Company Investment’’, for further information about transactions between the
Company and former Parent.

Revenue Recognition

General

The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has

occurred or services are rendered, the sales price or fee is fixed or determinable, and collectability is
reasonably assured. Additionally, the Company recognizes hardware revenue on sales to channel partners,
including resellers, distributors or value-added solution providers at the time of delivery when the channel
partners have economic substance apart from the Company, and the Company has completed its obligations
related to the sale. The Company generally recognizes revenue for its standalone software sales to channel
partners on receipt of evidence that the software has been sold to a specific end user. The Company limits the
amount of revenue recognized for delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery
of products or services, future performance obligations or subject to customer-specified refund or return rights.

The Company reduces revenue for customer and distributor programs and incentive offerings, including
price protection, rebates, promotions, other volume-based incentives, and expected returns, at the later of the
date of revenue recognition or the date the sales incentive is offered. Future market conditions and product
transitions may require the Company to take actions to increase customer incentive offerings, possibly resulting
in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered. For certain incentive programs, the
Company estimates the number of customers expected to redeem the incentive based on historical experience
and the specific terms and conditions of the incentive.

In instances when revenue is derived from sales of third-party vendor products or services, the Company
records revenue on a gross basis when the Company is a principal to the transaction and on a net basis when

HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1: Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

the Company is acting as an agent between the customer and the vendor. The Company considers several
factors to determine whether it is acting as a principal or an agent, most notably whether the Company is the
primary obligor to the customer, has established its own pricing and has inventory and credit risks.

The Company reports revenue net of any taxes collected from customers and remitted to government
authorities, with the collected taxes recorded as current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government
authority.

Multiple element arrangements

When a sales arrangement contains multiple elements or deliverables, such as hardware and software

products, and/or services, the Company allocates revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy.
The selling price for a deliverable is based on its vendor specific objective evidence (‘‘VSOE’’) of selling price,
if available, third-party evidence (‘‘TPE’’) if VSOE of selling price is not available, or estimated selling price
(‘‘ESP’’) if neither VSOE of selling price nor TPE is available. The Company establishes VSOE of selling price
using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately and, in rare instances, using the price
established by management having the relevant authority. The Company establishes TPE of selling price by
evaluating largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly
situated customers. The Company establishes ESP based on management judgment considering internal
factors such as margin objectives, pricing practices and controls, customer segment pricing strategies and the
product life-cycle. Consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and
technology industry life-cycles. In most arrangements with multiple elements, the Company allocates the
transaction price to the individual units of accounting at inception of the arrangement based on their relative
selling price.

In multiple element arrangements that include software that is more-than-incidental, the Company

allocates the transaction price to the individual units of accounting for the non-software deliverables and to the
software deliverables as a group using the relative selling price of each of the deliverables in the arrangement
based on the selling price hierarchy. If the arrangement contains more than one software deliverable, the
transaction price allocated to the group of software deliverables is then allocated to each component software
deliverable.

The Company evaluates each deliverable in an arrangement to determine whether it represents a

separate unit of accounting. A deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has standalone
value to the customer. For elements with no standalone value, the Company recognizes revenue consistent
with the pattern of the undelivered elements. If the arrangement includes a customer-negotiated refund or
return right or other contingency relative to the delivered items, and the delivery and performance of the
undelivered items is considered probable and substantially within the Company’s control, the delivered element
constitutes a separate unit of accounting. In arrangements with combined units of accounting, changes in the
allocation of the transaction price among elements may impact the timing of revenue recognition for the
contract but will not change the total revenue recognized for the contract.

Product revenue

Hardware

Under the Company’s standard terms and conditions of sale, the Company transfers title and risk of loss

to the customer at the time product is delivered to the customer and recognizes revenue accordingly, unless
customer acceptance is uncertain or significant obligations to the customer remain. The Company reduces
revenue for estimated customer returns, price protection, rebates and other programs offered under sales
agreements established by the Company with its distributors and resellers. The Company records revenue from
the sale of equipment under sales-type leases as product revenue at the inception of the lease. The Company

accrues the estimated cost of post-sale obligations, including standard product warranties, based on historical
experience at the time the Company recognizes revenue.

Software

The Company recognizes revenue from perpetual software licenses at the inception of the license term,

assuming all revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied. Term-based software license revenue is generally
recognized ratably over the term of the license. The Company uses the residual method to allocate revenue to
software licenses at the inception of the arrangement when VSOE of fair value for all undelivered elements,
such as post-contract customer support, exists and all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied.
The Company recognizes revenue from maintenance and unspecified upgrades or updates provided on a
when-and-if-available basis ratably over the period during which such items are delivered. The Company
recognizes revenue for software-as-a-service (‘‘SaaS’’) arrangements as the service is delivered, generally on a
straight-line basis, over the contractual period of performance.

Services revenue

The Company recognizes revenue from fixed-price support or maintenance contracts, including extended

warranty contracts and software post-contract customer support agreements, ratably over the contract period
and recognizes the costs associated with these contracts as incurred. For time and material contracts, the
Company recognizes revenue as services are rendered and recognizes costs as they are incurred.

The Company recognizes revenue from certain fixed-price contracts, such as consulting arrangements, as

work progresses over the contract period on a proportional performance basis, as determined by the
percentage of labor costs incurred to date compared to the total estimated labor costs of a contract. Estimates
of total project costs for fixed-price contracts are regularly reassessed during the life of a contract. Provisions
for estimated losses on fixed-priced contracts are recognized in the period when such losses become known. If
reasonable and reliable cost estimates for a project cannot be made, the Company uses the completed
contract method and recognizes revenue and costs upon service completion.

The Company recognizes revenue from operating leases on a straight-line basis as service revenue over

the rental period.

Financing income

Sales-type and direct-financing leases produce financing income, which the Company recognizes at

consistent rates of return over the lease term.

Deferred revenue

The Company records amounts invoiced to customers in excess of revenue recognized as deferred

revenue until the revenue recognition criteria are satisfied. The Company records revenue that is earned and
recognized in excess of amounts invoiced on services contracts as trade receivables.

Deferred revenue represents amounts invoiced in advance for product support contracts, software

customer support contracts, consulting and integration projects, product sales or leasing income.

Shipping and Handling

The Company includes costs related to shipping and handling in Cost of products.

Note 1: Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Stock-Based Compensation

Stock-based compensation expense is based on the measurement date fair value of the award and is

recognized only for those awards expected to meet the service and performance vesting conditions on a
straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award. Stock-based compensation expense is
determined at the aggregate grant level for service-based awards and at the individual vesting tranche level for
awards with performance and/or market conditions. The forfeiture rate is estimated based on historical
experience.

Prior to November 1, 2015, the Company’s employees participated in former Parent’s stock-based

compensation plans. Stock-based compensation expense has been allocated to the Company based on the
awards and terms previously granted to the Company’s employees as well as an allocation of former Parent’s
corporate and shared functional employee expenses.

Retirement and Post-Retirement Plans

The Company has various defined benefit, other contributory and noncontributory, retirement and
post-retirement plans. The Company generally amortizes unrecognized actuarial gains and losses on a
straight-line basis over the average remaining estimated service life or, in the case of closed plans, life
expectancy of participants. In limited cases, actuarial gains and losses are amortized using the corridor
approach. See Note 6, ‘‘Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans’’ for a full description of these plans and
the accounting and funding policies.

Advertising

Costs to produce advertising are expensed as incurred during production. Costs to communicate
advertising are expensed when the advertising is first run. Advertising expense totaled approximately
$255 million in fiscal 2017, $215 million in fiscal 2016 and $147 million in fiscal 2015.

Restructuring

The Company records charges associated with approved restructuring plans to reorganize one or more of

the Company’s business segments, to remove duplicative headcount and infrastructure associated with
business acquisitions or to simplify business processes and accelerate innovation. Restructuring charges can
include severance costs to eliminate a specified number of employees, infrastructure charges to vacate
facilities and consolidate operations, and contract cancellation costs. The Company records restructuring
charges based on estimated employee terminations and site closure and consolidation plans. The Company
accrues for severance and other employee separation costs under these actions when it is probable that
benefits will be paid and the amount is reasonably estimable. The rates used in determining severance
accruals are based on existing plans, historical experiences and negotiated settlements.

Taxes on Earnings

For fiscal 2015 and prior, current income tax liabilities related to entities which filed jointly with former

Parent are assumed to be immediately settled with former Parent and are relieved through the former Parent
company investment account and the Net transfers to former Parent in the Consolidated and Combined
Statements of Cash Flows. Income tax expense and other income tax-related information contained in these
Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements are presented on a separate return basis, as if the Company
filed its own tax returns. The separate return method applies the accounting guidance for income taxes to the
standalone financial statements as if the Company were a separate taxpayer and a standalone enterprise for
fiscal 2015. As of November 1, 2015, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company was formally separated from
former Parent; as such, any current income tax liabilities generated by the Company will be settled by the
Company and are no longer included with tax filings of former Parent.

Note 1: Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of

temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted
tax rates in effect for the year the differences are expected to reverse.

The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more
likely than not to realize. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, the Company considers future
market growth, forecasted earnings, future sources of taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in
which the Company operates, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. In the event the Company were
to determine that it is more likely than not that the Company will be unable to realize all or part of its deferred
tax assets in the future, the Company would increase the valuation allowance and recognize a corresponding
charge to earnings or other comprehensive income in the period in which such a determination were made.
Likewise, if the Company later determines that the deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized,
the Company would reverse the applicable portion of the previously recognized valuation allowance. In order
for the Company to realize deferred tax assets, the Company must be able to generate sufficient taxable
income in the jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located.

The Company records accruals for uncertain tax positions when the Company believes that it is not more

likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the
technical merits of the position. The Company makes adjustments to these accruals when facts and
circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. The provision for
income taxes includes the effects of adjustments for uncertain tax positions, effects of potential settlement of
certain pre-Separation Hewlett-Packard Company income tax liabilities, as well as any related interest and
penalties.

Accounts Receivable

The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts for accounts receivable. The Company
records a specific reserve for individual accounts when the Company becomes aware of specific customer
circumstances, such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing or deterioration in the customer’s operating results or
financial position. If there are additional changes in circumstances related to the specific customer, the
Company further adjusts estimates of the recoverability of receivables. The Company maintains bad debt
reserves for all other customers based on a variety of factors, including the use of third-party credit risk models
that generate quantitative measures of default probabilities based on market factors, the financial condition of
customers, the length of time receivables are past due, trends in the weighted-average risk rating for the
portfolio, macroeconomic conditions, information derived from competitive benchmarking, significant one-time
events, and historical experience. The past due or delinquency status of a receivable is based on the
contractual payment terms of the receivable.

The Company participated in former Parent’s third-party revolving short-term financing arrangements

intended to facilitate the working capital requirements of certain customers through July 31, 2015. From and
after August 1, 2015, all of the Company’s transactions are under its own third-party revolving short-term
financing arrangements. These financing arrangements, which in certain cases provide for partial recourse,
result in the transfer of the Company’s trade receivables to a third party. The Company reflects amounts
transferred to, but not yet collected from, the third party in Accounts receivable in the Consolidated Balance
Sheets. For arrangements involving an element of recourse, the fair value of the recourse obligation is
measured using market data from similar transactions and reported as a current liability in Other accrued
liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1: Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Concentrations of Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk

consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, investments, receivables from trade customers and contract
manufacturers, financing receivables and derivatives.

The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents, investments, derivatives, and certain other financial

instruments with various financial institutions. These financial institutions are located in many different
geographic regions, and the Company’s policy is designed to limit exposure from any particular institution. As
part of its risk management processes, the Company performs periodic evaluations of the relative credit
standing of these financial institutions. The Company has not sustained material credit losses from instruments
held at these financial institutions. The Company utilizes derivative contracts to protect against the effects of
foreign currency and interest rate exposures. Such contracts involve the risk of non-performance by the
counterparty, which could result in a material loss.

Credit risk with respect to accounts receivable and financing receivables is generally diversified due to the

large number of entities comprising the Company’s customer base and their dispersion across many different
industries and geographic regions. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of the financial condition
of its customers and may require collateral, such as letters of credit and bank guarantees, in certain
circumstances. As of October 31, 2017, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s
gross accounts receivable balance. As of October 31, 2016, one customer accounted for approximately 11% of
the Company’s gross accounts receivable balance.

The Company utilizes outsourced manufacturers around the world to manufacture company-designed

products. The Company may purchase product components from suppliers and sell those components to its
outsourced manufacturers thereby creating receivable balances from the outsourced manufacturers. The three
largest outsourced manufacturer receivable balances collectively represented 87% and 83% of the Company’s
manufacturer receivables of $594 million and $382 million at October 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The
Company includes the manufacturer receivables in Other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets on
a gross basis. The Company’s credit risk associated with these receivables is mitigated wholly or in part by the
amount the Company owes to these outsourced manufacturers, as the Company generally has the legal right
to offset its payables to the outsourced manufacturers against these receivables. The Company does not reflect
the sale of these components in revenue and does not recognize any profit on these component sales until the
related products are sold by the Company, at which time any profit is recognized as a reduction to cost of
sales. The Company obtains a significant number of components from single source suppliers due to
technology, availability, price, quality or other considerations. The loss of a single source supplier, the
deterioration of the Company’s relationship with a single source supplier, or any unilateral modification to the
contractual terms under which the Company is supplied components by a single source supplier could
adversely affect the Company’s revenue and gross margins.

Inventory

The Company values inventory at the lower of cost or market. Cost is computed using standard cost

which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. Adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its
net realizable value are made, if required, for estimated excess or obsolescence determined primarily by future
demand forecasts.

Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1: Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Property, Plant and Equipment

The Company states property, plant and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation. The Company

capitalizes additions and improvements and expenses maintenance and repairs as incurred. Depreciation
expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated useful
lives are five to 40 years for buildings and improvements and three to 15 years for machinery and equipment.
The Company depreciates leasehold improvements over the life of the lease or the asset, whichever is shorter.
The Company depreciates equipment held for lease over the initial term of the lease to the equipment’s
estimated residual value. The estimated useful lives of assets used solely to support a customer services
contract generally do not exceed the term of the customer contract. On retirement or disposition, the asset cost
and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the Consolidated Balance Sheets with any gain or loss
recognized in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Earnings.

The Company capitalizes certain internal and external costs incurred to acquire or create internal use

software, principally related to software coding, designing system interfaces and installation and testing of the
software. The Company amortizes capitalized internal use software costs using the straight-line method over
the estimated useful lives of the software, generally from three to five years.

Business Combinations

The Company includes the results of operations of acquired businesses in the Company’s consolidated

and combined results prospectively from the date of acquisition. The Company allocates the fair value of
purchase consideration to the assets acquired including in-process research and development (‘‘IPR&D’’),
liabilities assumed, and non-controlling interests in the acquired entity generally based on their fair values at
the acquisition date. IPR&D is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and
assessed for impairment thereafter. When the IPR&D project is complete, it is reclassified as an amortizable
purchased intangible asset and is amortized over its estimated useful life. If an IPR&D project is abandoned,
the Company will record a charge for the value of the related intangible asset to the Company’s Consolidated
and Combined Statement of Earnings in the period it is abandoned. The excess of the fair value of purchase
consideration over the fair value of the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and non-controlling interests in the
acquired entity is recorded as goodwill. The primary items that generate goodwill include the value of the
synergies between the acquired company and the Company and the value of the acquired assembled
workforce, neither of which qualifies for recognition as an intangible asset. Acquisition-related expenses and
post-acquisition restructuring costs are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed
as incurred.

Goodwill

The Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in

circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. The Company is permitted to
conduct a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill
impairment test. The Company performs a quantitative test for all of its reporting units as part of its annual
goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year.

Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. As of October 31, 2017, the Company’s

reporting units are consistent with the reportable segments identified in Note 3, ‘‘Segment Information’’. To test
for impairment, the Company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount. The
Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units using a weighting of fair values derived most
significantly from the income approach, and to a lesser extent, the market approach. Under the income
approach, the Company estimates the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated
future cash flows. The Company prepares cash flow projections based on management’s estimates of revenue
growth rates and operating margins, taking into consideration industry and market conditions. The Company
bases the discount rate on the weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with

Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1: Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

business-specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting unit’s ability to execute on the
projected cash flows. Under the market approach, the Company estimates fair value based on market multiples
of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and
investment characteristics as the reporting unit. The Company weights the fair value derived from the market
approach depending on the level of comparability of these publicly traded companies to the reporting unit.
When market comparables are not meaningful or not available, the Company estimates the fair value of a
reporting unit using only the income approach.

If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount of the net assets assigned to that

reporting unit, goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required. If the fair value of the reporting unit is
less than its carrying amount, goodwill is impaired. The goodwill impairment loss is measured as the excess of
the reporting unit’s carrying value over its fair value (not to exceed the total goodwill allocated to that reporting
unit).

Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets

The Company reviews intangible assets with finite lives and long-lived assets for impairment whenever

events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The
Company assesses the recoverability of assets based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows
expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If the undiscounted future cash flows are
less than the carrying amount, the asset is impaired. The Company measures the amount of impairment loss, if
any, as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value using an income approach
or, when available and appropriate, using a market approach. The Company amortizes intangible assets with
finite lives using the straight-line method over the estimated economic lives of the assets, ranging from one to
ten years.

Assets Held for Sale

The Company classifies its long-lived assets to be sold as held for sale in the period (i) it has approved
and committed to a plan to sell the asset, (ii) the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition,
(iii) an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to sell the asset have been initiated, (iv) the
sale of the asset is probable, (v) the asset is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in
relation to its current fair value, and (vi) it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that
the plan will be withdrawn. The Company initially measures a long-lived asset that is classified as held for sale
at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less any costs to sell. Any loss resulting from this measurement
is recognized in the period in which the held for sale criteria are met. Conversely, gains are not recognized on
the sale of a long-lived asset until the date of sale. Upon designation as an asset held for sale, the Company
stops recording depreciation expense on the asset. The Company assesses the fair value of a long-lived asset
less any costs to sell at each reporting period and until the asset is no longer is classified as held for sale.

Equity Method Investments

Investments and ownership interests are accounted for under equity method accounting if the Company

has the ability to exercise significant influence, but does not have a controlling financial interest. The Company
records its interest in the net earnings of its equity method investees, along with adjustments for unrealized
profits or losses on intra-entity transactions and amortization of basis differences, within earnings or loss from
equity interests in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Earnings. Profits or losses related to intra-
entity sales with its equity method investees are eliminated until realized by the investor or investee. Basis
differences represent differences between the cost of the investment and the underlying equity in net assets of
the investment and are generally amortized over the lives of the related assets that gave rise to them. The
Company records its interest in the net earnings of its equity method investments based on the most recently
available financial statements of the investees.

Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1: Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

The carrying amount of the investment in equity interests is adjusted to reflect the Company’s interest in
net earnings, dividends received and other-than-temporary impairments. The Company reviews for impairment
whenever factors indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable. In such a case,
the decrease in value is recognized in the period the impairment occurs in the Consolidated and Combined
Statement of Earnings.

Debt and Marketable Equity Securities Investments

Debt and marketable equity securities are generally considered available-for-sale and are reported at fair

value with unrealized gains and losses, net of applicable taxes, in Accumulated other comprehensive loss in
the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Realized gains and losses for available-for-sale securities are calculated
based on the specific identification method and included in Interest and other, net in the Consolidated and
Combined Statements of Earnings. The Company monitors its investment portfolio for potential impairment on a
quarterly basis. When the carrying amount of an investment in debt securities exceeds its fair value and the
decline in value is determined to be other-than-temporary, the Company records an impairment charge to
Interest and other, net in the amount of the credit loss and the balance, if any, is recorded in Accumulated
other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Derivatives

The Company uses derivative financial instruments, primarily forwards, swaps, and, at times, options, to

hedge certain foreign currency and interest rate exposures. The Company also may use other derivative
instruments, such as forwards, to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures. The Company does not
use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. See Note 14, ‘‘Financial Instruments’’, for a full
description of the Company’s derivative financial instrument activities and related accounting policies.

Loss Contingencies

The Company is involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings that arise in the

ordinary course of business. The Company records a liability for contingencies when it believes it is both
probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. See
Note 19, ‘‘Litigation and Contingencies’’, for a full description of the Company’s loss contingencies and related
accounting policies.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

In January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (‘‘FASB’’) amended the existing accounting

standards for intangible assets. The amendments simplify how an entity is required to test goodwill for
impairment by eliminating the second step of the goodwill impairment test, which measures a goodwill
impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of a reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of
that goodwill. The Company adopted the amendments in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and applied them
prospectively, as permitted by the standard. The adoption of these amendments did not have a material impact
on the Company’s Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements.

In April 2015, the FASB amended the existing accounting standards for intangible assets. The

amendments provide explicit guidance to customers in determining the accounting for fees paid in a cloud
computing arrangement, wherein the arrangements that do not convey a software license to the customer are
accounted for as service contracts. The amendments also eliminate the practice of accounting for software
licenses as executory contracts which may result in more software assets being capitalized. The Company
adopted the amendments in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and applied them retrospectively to all periods
presented, as permitted by the standard. The adoption of these amendments did not have a material impact on
the Company’s Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements.

Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1: Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

In April 2015, the FASB amended the existing accounting standards for imputation of interest. The
amendments require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented on the
classified balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability, consistent
with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs is not affected by
these amendments. The Company adopted the amendments in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and applied them
retrospectively to all periods presented. For fiscal 2016, the adoption resulted in the reclassification of
$50 million of debt issuance costs from Long-term financing receivables and other assets to Notes payable and
short-term borrowings and Long-term debt on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. With the exception
of the above reclassification, the adoption of these amendments did not have a material impact on the
Company’s Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements.

Recently Enacted Accounting Pronouncements

In August 2017, the FASB amended the existing accounting standards for hedge accounting. The
amendments expand an entity’s ability to hedge non-financial and financial risk components and reduce
complexity in fair value hedges of interest rate risk. The new guidance eliminates the requirement to separately
measure and report hedge ineffectiveness and requires the entire change in the fair value of a hedging
instrument to be presented in the same income statement line as the hedged item. The guidance also
simplifies certain documentation and assessment requirements and modifies the accounting for components
excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. The Company is required to adopt the guidance in the
first quarter of fiscal 2020. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the timing and the
impact of these amendments on its Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements.

In March 2017, the FASB amended the existing accounting standards for retirement benefits. The

amendments require the presentation of the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost in the same
income statement line items as other employee compensation costs, unless eligible for capitalization. The other
components of net periodic benefit costs will be presented separately from service cost as non-operating costs.
The Company is required to adopt the guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Early adoption is permitted.
The Company is currently evaluating the timing and the impact of these amendments on its Consolidated and
Combined Financial Statements.

In November 2016, the FASB amended the existing accounting standards for the classification and

presentation of restricted cash in the statement of cash flow. The amendments require that the statement of
cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents and amounts generally
described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. The Company is required to adopt the guidance in
the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The amendments should be applied retrospectively to all periods presented.
Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company is currently evaluating the
timing and the impact of these amendments on its Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements.

In October 2016, the FASB amended the existing accounting standards for income taxes. The

amendments require the recognition of the income tax consequences for intra-entity transfers of assets other
than inventory when the transfer occurs. Under current GAAP, current and deferred income taxes for intra-
entity asset transfers are not recognized until the asset has been sold to an outside party. The amendments
should be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained
earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The Company is required to adopt the guidance in the
first quarter of fiscal 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the timing and the
impact of these amendments on its Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements.

In August 2016, the FASB amended the existing accounting standards for the statement of cash flows.
The amendments provide guidance on eight classification issues related to the statement of cash flows. The
Company is required to adopt the guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The amendments should be
applied retrospectively to all periods presented. For issues that are impracticable to apply retrospectively, the

amendments may be applied prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. Early adoption is permitted,
including adoption in an interim period. The Company is currently evaluating the timing and the impact of these
amendments on its Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements.

In June 2016, the FASB amended the existing accounting standards for the measurement of credit losses.

The amendments require an entity to estimate its lifetime expected credit loss for most financial instruments,
including trade and lease receivables, and record an allowance for the portion of the amortized cost the entity
does not expect to collect. The estimate of expected credit losses should consider historical information, current
information, and reasonable and supportable forecasts, including estimates of prepayments. The Company is
required to adopt the guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Early adoption is permitted beginning in fiscal
2020. The Company is currently evaluating the timing and the impact of these amendments on its Consolidated
and Combined Financial Statements.

In March 2016, the FASB amended the existing accounting standards for employee share-based payment

arrangements. The amendments require all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies associated with share-
based payments to be recognized as income tax benefit or income tax expense, respectively, rather than as
additional paid-in capital. The amendments also increase the amount an employer can withhold in order to
cover income taxes on awards, allows companies to recognize forfeitures of awards as they occur, and
requires companies to present excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation as an operating activity in
the statement of cash flows rather than as a financing activity. As a result of these changes, subsequent to
adoption, the Company’s provision for income taxes, net earnings and cash flows from operating activities will
be impacted by fluctuations in stock price between the grant dates and vesting dates of equity awards. The
Company is required to adopt the guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.

In February 2016, the FASB amended the existing accounting standards for leases. The amendments

require lessees to record, at lease inception, a lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments and a
right-of-use (‘‘ROU’’) asset for the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term on their balance sheets.
Lessees may elect to not recognize lease liabilities and ROU assets for most leases with terms of 12 months
or less. The lease liability is measured at the present value of the lease payments over the lease term. The
ROU asset will be based on the liability, adjusted for lease prepayments, lease incentives received, and the
lessee’s initial direct costs. For finance leases, lease expense will be the sum of interest on the lease obligation
and amortization of the ROU asset, resulting in a front-loaded expense pattern. For operating leases, lease
expense will generally be recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The amended lessor
accounting model is similar to the current model, updated to align with certain changes to the lessee model
and the new revenue standard. The current sale-leaseback guidance, including guidance applicable to real
estate, is also replaced with a new model for both lessees and lessors. The Company is required to adopt the
guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 using a modified retrospective approach. Early adoption is permitted.
The Company is currently evaluating the timing and the impact of these amendments on its Consolidated and
Combined Financial Statements.

In May 2014, the FASB amended the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. The

amendments are based on the principle that revenue should be recognized to depict the transfer of promised
goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be
entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. In doing so, the Company will need to use additional
judgment and estimates than under the existing guidance. This ASU also requires more extensive disclosures
regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with
customers. The Company is required to adopt the standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The amendments
may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect
recognized as of the date of initial application. The Company plans to adopt the new revenue standard in the
first quarter of fiscal 2019, beginning November 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective method.

Note 1: Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

The Company has completed a review of the accounting systems and processes required to apply the

modified retrospective method. In response, the Company is in the process of implementing a new IT solution
as part of the adoption of the new standard. The Company expects revenue recognition for its broad portfolio
of hardware, software and services offerings to remain largely unchanged. However, the guidance is expected
to change the timing of revenue recognition in certain areas, including accounting for certain software licenses.
The Company is still assessing the impact of these changes. Since the Company currently expenses sales
commissions as incurred, the requirement in the new standard to capitalize certain sales commissions will
result in an accounting change for the Company. The Company is in the process of quantifying the impact on
its Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. The Company will continue to assess the impact of the
new revenue standard as it works through the adoption in fiscal 2018, and there still remain areas to be fully
concluded upon. Further, there remain ongoing interpretive reviews, which may alter the Company’s
conclusions and the impact on its Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements.

Note 3: Segment Information

Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s operations are organized into three segments for financial reporting

purposes: the Enterprise Group (‘‘EG’’), Financial Services (‘‘FS’’) and Corporate Investments. Hewlett Packard
Enterprise’s organizational structure is based on a number of factors that the Chief Operating Decision Maker
(‘‘CODM’’), the Chief Executive Officer (‘‘CEO’’), uses to evaluate, view and run business operations, which
include, but are not limited to, customer base and homogeneity of products and technology. The segments are
based on this organizational structure and information reviewed by the Company’s CODM to evaluate segment
results.

A summary description of each segment follows.

The Enterprise Group provides secure, software-defined technology and services that enable customers to

move data seamlessly across their hybrid IT environments and power the intelligent edge that runs campus,
branch and IoT applications. Described below are Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s business units and capabilities
within EG.

•

Servers offers both Industry Standard Servers (‘‘ISS’’) as well as Mission-Critical Servers (‘‘MCS’’) to
address the full array of the Company’s customers’ computing needs. ISS provides a range of
products, from entry level servers through premium HPE ProLiant, secure and versatile rack and

environments. HPE’s key products include Nimble Storage and the 3PAR StoreServ Storage
Platform, which are designed for virtualization, cloud and IT-as-a-service. Converged Storage
solutions include 3PAR StoreServe, StoreOnce and StoreVirtual products. Traditional storage
includes tape, storage networking and legacy external disk products such as EVA and XP.

Networking offers HPE and Aruba branded software-defined switches, routers, wireless local area
network, network virtualization, security, location-based services and network management products
that deliver open, scalable, secure, agile and consistent solutions that span data centers, campus
and branch environments.

Technology Services creates preferred IT experiences that power a digital business. The Technology
Services team and the Company’s extensive partner network provide value across the IT life cycle
delivering advice, transformation projects, professional services, support services, and operational
services for Hybrid IT and the Intelligent Edge. Technology Services is also a provider of
on-premises flexible consumption models that enable IT agility, simplify operations and align costs to
business value. Technology Services offerings comprise HPE Pointnext, which includes Data Center
Care, Proactive Care and Technology Consulting, as well as Aruba Services, and Communications
and Media Solutions (‘‘CMS’’).

Financial Services provides flexible investment solutions, such as leasing, financing, IT consumption, and

utility programs and asset management services, for customers to enable the creation of unique technology
deployment models and acquire complete IT solutions, including hardware, software and services from Hewlett
Packard Enterprise and others. Providing flexible services and capabilities that support the entire IT life cycle,
FS partners with customers globally to help build investment strategies that enhance their business agility and
support their business transformation. FS offers a wide selection of investment solution capabilities for large
enterprise customers and channel partners, along with an array of financial options to SMBs and educational
and governmental entities.

Corporate Investments includes Hewlett Packard Labs and certain cloud-related business incubation

projects.

Segment Policy

Hewlett Packard Enterprise derives the results of its business segments directly from its internal

management reporting system. The accounting policies that Hewlett Packard Enterprise uses to derive segment
results are substantially the same as those the consolidated company uses. The CODM measures the
performance of each segment based on several metrics, including earnings from operations. The CODM uses
these results, in part, to evaluate the performance of, and to allocate resources to each of the segments.

Segment revenue includes revenues from sales to external customers and intersegment revenues that

reflect transactions between the segments on an arm’s-length basis. Intersegment revenues primarily consist of
sales of hardware and software that are sourced internally and, in the majority of the cases, are financed as
operating leases by FS to our customers. Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s consolidated net revenue is derived and
reported after the elimination of intersegment revenues from such arrangements.

Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 3: Segment Information (Continued)

Hewlett Packard Enterprise periodically engages in intercompany advanced royalty payment and licensing
arrangements that may result in advance payments between subsidiaries. Revenues from these intercompany
arrangements are deferred and recognized as earned over the term of the arrangement by the Hewlett Packard
Enterprise legal entities involved in such transactions; however, these advanced payments are eliminated from
revenues as reported by Hewlett Packard Enterprise and its business segments. As disclosed in Note 8,
‘‘Taxes on Earnings’’, Hewlett Packard Enterprise executed intercompany advanced royalty payment
arrangements resulting in advanced payments of $439 million and $3.7 billion during fiscal 2017 and 2016,
respectively. In these transactions, the payments were received in the U.S. from a foreign consolidated affiliate,
with a deferral of intercompany revenues over the term of the arrangements, approximately 15 years and
5 years, respectively. The impact of these intercompany arrangements is eliminated from both Hewlett Packard
Enterprise’s consolidated and segment net revenues.

Financing interest in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Earnings reflects interest expense on

borrowing- and funding-related activity associated with FS and its subsidiaries, and debt issued by Hewlett
Packard Enterprise for which a portion of the proceeds benefited FS.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise does not allocate to its segments certain operating expenses which it

manages at the corporate level. These unallocated costs include certain corporate governance costs, stock-
based compensation expense, restructuring charges, transformation costs, amortization of intangible assets,
acquisition and other related charges, separation costs, disaster charges, defined benefit plan settlement
charges and remeasurement benefit and the gain on H3C and MphasiS divestitures.

Segment Organizational Changes

As of April 1, 2017 and September 1, 2017, with the completion of the Everett and Seattle Transactions,

respectively, the Company reclassified the historical net (loss) earnings from the former ES and Software
segments, to Net loss from discontinued operations in its Consolidated and Combined Statements of Earnings.

Effective at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company implemented organizational

changes to align its segment financial reporting more closely with its current business structure. These
organizational changes resulted in: (i) within the Enterprise Group segment, primarily, the transfer of the big
data storage product group previously reported within the Servers business unit to the Storage business unit;
the transfer of the Aruba services capabilities previously reported within the Networking business unit to the
Technology Services (‘‘TS’’) business unit; and (ii) the transfer of the CMS product group previously reported
within the former ES segment to the TS business unit within the Enterprise Group segment.

The Company reflected these changes to its segment information retrospectively to the earliest period
presented, which resulted in: (i) within the Enterprise Group segment, primarily, the transfer of net revenue
from the big data storage product group previously reported within the Servers business unit to the Storage
business unit; the transfer of net revenue from the Aruba services capabilities previously reported within the
Networking business unit to the TS business unit; and (ii) the transfer of net revenue, related eliminations of
intersegment revenues and operating profit from the CMS product group previously reported within the former
ES segment to the Technology Services business unit within the Enterprise Group segment.

Effective at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2017 and prior to the completion of the Everett

Transaction, the Company transferred the historical net revenue and operating profit from the previously
divested MphasiS product group, which was reported within the former ES segment, to the Corporate
Investments segment.

The changes within the Enterprise Group segment had no impact on Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s

previously reported Enterprise Group segment net revenue and earnings from operations. The change between
the former ES segment and the Enterprise Group segment had no impact on Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s
previously reported consolidated net revenue, earnings from continuing operations, net earnings from
continuing operations or net earnings per share from continuing operations.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company adopted ASU 2015-03, which simplifies the
presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring debt issuance to be presented as a deduction from the
corresponding debt liability rather than an asset that is amortized. The Company adopted the standard
retrospectively for the prior period presented.

•

•

Assets allocated to the EG segment in fiscal 2017 increased as compared to fiscal 2016 due
primarily to business acquisitions during fiscal 2017.

Corporate and unallocated assets in fiscal 2017 decreased as compared to fiscal 2016 due primarily
to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents, partially offset by an increase in deferred tax assets.

Major Customers

No single customer represented 10% or more of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s total net revenue in any

fiscal year presented.

Geographic Information

Net revenue by country is based upon the sales location that predominately represents the customer
location. For each of the fiscal years of 2017, 2016 and 2015, other than the U.S., no country represented
more than 10% of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s net revenue.

The current restructuring liability related to the plans in the table above, reported in Accrued restructuring

in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of October 31, 2017 and 2016, was $158 million and $256 million,
respectively. The non-current restructuring liability related to the plans in the table above, reported in Other
liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of October 31, 2017 and 2016, was $96 million and
$42 million, respectively.

Fiscal 2015 Restructuring Plan

On September 14, 2015, former Parent’s Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan (the ‘‘2015

Plan’’) in connection with the Separation. As a result of the Everett and Seattle Transactions, cost amounts and
total headcount exits were revised. As such, as of October 31, 2017, the Company had eliminated 8,300
positions as part of the 2015 Plan. As of October 31, 2017, the plan is substantially complete, with no further
positions being eliminated. The Company recognized $0.8 billion in total aggregate charges in connection with
the 2015 Plan through fiscal 2017, of which approximately $0.7 billion related to workforce reductions and
approximately $0.1 billion primarily related to real estate consolidation and asset impairments. The severance-
and infrastructure-related cash payments associated with the 2015 Plan are expected to be paid out through
fiscal 2021.

Fiscal 2012 Restructuring Plan

On May 23, 2012, former Parent adopted a multi-year restructuring plan (the ‘‘2012 Plan’’) designed to
simplify business processes, accelerate innovation and deliver better results for customers, employees and
stockholders. As a result of the Everett and Seattle Transactions, cost amounts and total headcount exits were
revised. As such, as of October 31, 2017, the Company had eliminated 10,300 positions, with a portion of
those employees exiting the Company as part of voluntary enhanced early retirement (‘‘EER’’) programs in the

U.S. and in certain other countries. As of October 31, 2017, the plan is substantially complete, with no further
positions being eliminated. The Company recognized $1.4 billion in total aggregate charges in connection with
the 2012 Plan, of which approximately $1.3 billion related to workforce reductions, including the EER programs,
and approximately $0.1 billion related to infrastructure, including data center and real estate consolidation and
other items. The severance- and infrastructure-related cash payments associated with the 2012 Plan are
expected to be paid out through fiscal 2021.

Note 5: HPE Next

Transformation Costs

The HPE Next initiative is expected to be implemented through fiscal 2020, during which time the

Company expects to incur expenses for workforce reductions, to upgrade and simplify its IT infrastructure, and
for other non-labor actions. These costs will be partially offset by proceeds received from real estate sales.

During fiscal 2017, the Company incurred $359 million in net charges associated with the HPE Next
initiative, which were recorded within Transformation costs in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings and
include the following:

Restructuring Plan

On October 16, 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan in connection with
the HPE Next initiative (the ‘‘HPE Next Plan’’), which will be implemented through fiscal 2020. The changes to
the workforce will vary by country, based on local legal requirements and consultations with employee work
councils and other employee representatives, as appropriate, and are expected to be completed during fiscal
2019. As of October 31, 2017, the Company estimates that it will incur aggregate pre-tax charges of
approximately $0.9 billion through fiscal 2020 in connection with the HPE Next Plan, of which approximately
$0.7 billion relates to workforce reductions and approximately $0.2 billion relates to infrastructure, primarily real
estate site exits.

Note 5: HPE Next (Continued)

As of October 31, 2017, the current restructuring liability related to the HPE Next Plan, reported in

Accrued restructuring in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, was $287 million. The non-current restructuring
liability related to the HPE Next Plan, reported in Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of
October 31, 2017 was $9 million.

Assets Held for Sale

In connection with the HPE Next initiative, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company

determined that certain assets met the criteria to be classified as assets held for sale. The Company expects
these assets to be sold within the next 12 months. The carrying value of $14 million has been recorded within
Assets held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of October 31, 2017. For more information on the
Company’s policy on assets held for sale, refer to Note 1, ‘‘Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies’’.

Note 6: Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans

Defined Benefit Plans

The Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans worldwide, the most significant of which is in the

United Kingdom (‘‘UK’’). The pension plan in the UK is closed to new entrants, however, members continue to
earn benefit accruals. This plan provides benefits based on final pay and years of service and generally require
contributions from members.

Prior to the Everett and Seattle Transactions, the Company went through an analysis to determine which
defined benefit plans would be assigned to either the Company or to Everett or Seattle. The Company’s plans
either transferred in their entirety to Everett or Seattle, remained in their entirety with the Company, or were
split, thus resulting in the transfer of plan assets and liabilities between existing and newly created plans. The
Everett plans were legally established in the first and second quarter of fiscal 2017 and transferred and
reported as discontinued operations in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The Seattle plans were legally
established in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and transferred and reported as discontinued operations in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. As a result of the Everett and Seattle Transactions, the Company transferred out
plan assets of $8.3 billion, a benefit obligation of $8.1 billion and an accumulated other comprehensive loss of
$1.9 billion.

Prior to October 31, 2015, and with the exception of certain defined benefit pension plans of which the

Company was the sole sponsor, certain Hewlett Packard Enterprise eligible employees, retirees and other
former employees participated in certain U.S. and international defined benefit pension plans offered by former
Parent. These Shared plans, which included participants of both Company employees and employees of former
Parent, were accounted for as multiemployer benefit plans and the related net benefit plan obligations were not
included in the Company’s Combined and Consolidated Balance Sheets through July 31, 2015. The related
benefit plan expense was allocated to the Company based on the Company’s labor costs and allocations of
corporate and other shared functional personnel.

Certain benefit plans in the Company’s operations only included active, retired and other former Company
employees (‘‘Direct’’ plans) and were accounted for as single employer benefit plans prior to October 31, 2015.
Accordingly, the net benefit plan obligations and the related benefit plan expense of those plans have been
recorded in the Company’s Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for all periods presented.

In connection with the Separation, during the three months ended October 31, 2015, former Parent

transferred plan assets and liabilities primarily associated with Hewlett Packard Enterprise eligible employees,
retirees and other former employees to the Company. As a result, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, plan
assets of $11.7 billion, a benefit obligation of $11.9 billion and an accumulated other comprehensive loss of

Note 6: Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans (Continued)

$2.6 billion, primarily related to non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans, were assumed and recorded by the
Company.

Post-Retirement Benefit Plans

The Company sponsors retiree health and welfare benefit plans, the most significant of which is in the

U.S. Generally, employees hired before August 2008 are eligible for employer credits under the Hewlett
Packard Enterprise Retirement Medical Savings Account Plan (‘‘RMSA’’) upon attaining age 45. Employer
credits to the RMSA available after September 2008 are provided in the form of matching credits on employee
contributions made to a voluntary employee beneficiary association. Upon retirement, employees may use
these employer credits for the reimbursement of certain eligible medical expenses.

As a result of the Everett and Seattle Transactions, any employees who were involuntarily terminated

during fiscal 2017 were fully vested in their RMSA balances and are able to take a distribution out of their plan
balances.

Prior to July 31, 2015, former Parent sponsored retiree health and welfare benefit plans, the most

significant of which were in the U.S. All of these plans were accounted for as multiemployer benefit plans. The
Company recognized post-retirement benefit credits of $27 million in fiscal 2015 in the Combined Statement of
Earnings.

In connection with the Separation, during the three months ended October 31, 2015, former Parent

transferred a benefit obligation of $150 million, plan assets of $40 million and accumulated other
comprehensive income of $10 million, primarily associated with Hewlett Packard Enterprise eligible employees,
retirees and other former employees to the Company.

Defined Contribution Plans

The Company offers various defined contribution plans for U.S. and non-U.S. employees. Prior to the
Separation, former Parent offered various defined contribution plans for U.S. and non-U.S. employees. The
Company’s defined contribution expense was approximately $157 million in fiscal 2017, $213 million in fiscal
2016 and $194 million in fiscal 2015. Prior to the Separation, U.S. employees were automatically enrolled in
the Hewlett-Packard Company 401(k) Plan (‘‘HP 401(k) Plan’’) when they met eligibility requirements, unless
they declined participation. Effective November 1, 2015, the Company’s active employees were eligible to
participate in the newly created Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company 401(k) Plan (‘‘HPE 401(k) Plan’’), under
which the quarterly employer matching contributions were 100% of an employee’s contributions, up to a
maximum of 4% of eligible compensation. Effective January 1, 2017, the annual employer matching
contributions in the updated HPE 401(k) Plan became 50% of an employee’s contributions, up to a maximum
of 6% of eligible compensation.

As a result of the Everett and Seattle Transactions, any plan participants who were involuntarily

terminated during fiscal 2017 were fully vested in their Company matching contributions and earnings thereon,
and are able to take a distribution out of their plan balances.

Pension Benefit Expense

The Company’s net pension and post-retirement benefit costs that were directly attributable to the eligible

employees, retirees and other former employees of Hewlett Packard Enterprise and recognized in the
Consolidated and Combined Statements of Earnings for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 are presented in the table

Plan credit allocation represents the net cost impact of employees of HPE covered under Everett or
Seattle plans and employees of Everett or Seattle covered under HPE plans.
Net benefit cost from continuing operations for the Company’s U.S. defined benefit plans was not material
for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015.

The weighted-average assumptions used to calculate the net benefit cost (credit) from continuing

operations in the above table for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:

Prior to October 31, 2016, the Company estimated the service and interest cost components using a

single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curves used to measure the benefit obligation.
Beginning in fiscal 2017, the Company changed its method used to estimate the service and interest cost
components of net periodic benefit cost for defined benefit plans that use the yield curve approach, which
represent substantially all of defined benefit plans. The Company has elected to use a full yield curve approach
in the estimation of these components of benefit cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve
used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. The Company made
this change to improve the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding yield curve

spot rates and to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs. The Company has
accounted for this change as a change in estimate that is inseparable from a change in accounting principle
and has accounted for it prospectively beginning in fiscal 2017.

In fiscal 2017, in connection with the Everett and Seattle Transactions, the Company transferred plan
assets and liabilities from the Company’s plans to newly established Everett and Seattle plans. The
Company transferred net plan assets of $702 million and $97 million to Everett and Seattle, respectively,
and liabilities of $503 million and $165 million to Everett and Seattle, respectively.
Includes the addition/deletion of plans resulting from acquisitions or divestitures. Amounts are primarily
attributable to a business divestiture of outsourcing services in Germany and a Netherlands plan data
review that transferred HPI retirees to HPE.
As of October 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company’s U.S. defined benefit plans had zero plan assets and a
projected benefit obligation of $5 million and $7 million, respectively.

HP Invest Common Contractual Funds (CCFs) is an investment arrangement in which institutional
investors pool their assets. Units may be acquired in four different sub-funds focused on equities, fixed
income, alternative investments, and emerging markets. Each sub-fund is invested in accordance with the
fund’s investment objective and units are issued in relation to each sub-fund. While the sub-funds are not
publicly traded, the custodian strikes a net asset value either once or twice a month, depending on the
sub-fund. There are no redemption restrictions or future commitments on these investments.
Includes international insured contracts, derivative instruments and unsettled transactions.

Post-retirement benefit plan assets of $50 million and $47 million as of October 31, 2017 and 2016,

The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used to measure plan assets at fair value.

Investments in publicly traded equity securities are valued using the closing price on the measurement

date as reported on the stock exchange on which the individual securities are traded. For corporate,
government backed debt securities, and some other investments, fair value is based on observable inputs of
comparable market transactions. The valuation of certain real estate funds, insurance group annuity contracts
and alternative investments, such as limited partnerships and joint ventures, may require significant
management judgment. The valuation is generally based on fair value as reported by the asset manager and
adjusted for cash flows, if necessary. In making such an assessment, a variety of factors are reviewed by
management, including, but not limited to, the timeliness of fair value as reported by the asset manager and

Note 6: Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans (Continued)

changes in general economic and market conditions subsequent to the last fair value reported by the asset
manager. Cash and cash equivalents includes money market funds, which are valued based on cost, which
approximates fair value. Other than those assets that have quoted prices from an active market, investments
are generally classified in Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is
significant to the fair value measure in its entirety. Investments measured using net asset value as a practical
expedient are not categorized within the fair value hierarchy.

For the Company’s post-retirement benefit plans, 100% of the plan assets are invested in cash and cash

equivalents.

Investment Policy

The Company’s investment strategy is to seek a competitive rate of return relative to an appropriate level
of risk depending on the funded status of each plan and the timing of expected benefit payments. The majority
of the plans’ investment managers employ active investment management strategies with the goal of
outperforming the broad markets in which they invest. Risk management practices include diversification across
asset classes and investment styles and periodic rebalancing toward asset allocation targets. A number of the
plans’ investment managers are authorized to utilize derivatives for investment or liability exposures, and the
Company may utilize derivatives to effect asset allocation changes or to hedge certain investment or liability
exposures.

Asset allocation decisions are typically made by an independent board of trustees for the specific plan.

Investment objectives are designed to generate returns that will enable the plan to meet its future obligations.
In some countries, local regulations may restrict asset allocations, typically leading to a higher percentage of
investment in fixed income securities than would otherwise be deployed. The Company reviews the investment
strategy and provides a recommended list of investment managers for each country plan, with final decisions
on asset allocation and investment managers made by the board of trustees or investment committees for the
specific plan.

Basis for Expected Long-Term Rate of Return on Plan Assets

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the expected returns for each major asset

class in which the plan invests and the weight of each asset class in the target mix. Expected asset returns
reflect the current yield on government bonds, risk premiums for each asset class and expected real returns,
which considers each country’s specific inflation outlook. Because the Company’s investment policy is to
employ primarily active investment managers who seek to outperform the broader market, the expected returns
are adjusted to reflect the expected additional returns, net of fees.

Note 7: Stock-Based Compensation

Prior to the Separation, certain of the Company’s employees participated in stock-based compensation

plans sponsored by former Parent. Former Parent’s stock-based compensation plans included incentive
compensation plans (‘‘former Parent’s Plans’’) and an employee stock purchase plan (‘‘former Parent’s ESPP’’).
All awards granted under the plans were based on former Parent’s common shares and, as such, the award
activity is not reflected in the Company’s Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. For the fiscal year
ended October 31, 2015, stock-based compensation expense includes expense attributable to the Company
based on the awards and terms previously granted under the incentive compensation plan to the Company’s
employees and an allocation of former Parent’s corporate and shared functional employee expenses.
Accordingly, the amounts presented for fiscal 2015 are not necessarily indicative of future awards and do not
necessarily reflect the results that the Company would have experienced as an independent, publicly-traded
company. The share and per share data for fiscal 2015 presented in this note has not been adjusted to reflect
the impact of the Separation.

In conjunction with the Separation, the Company adopted the Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company 2015

Stock Incentive Plan (the ‘‘Plan’’). The Plan became effective on November 1, 2015. The total number of
shares of the Company’s common stock authorized under the Plan was 260 million. On January 25, 2017, the
Company amended the Plan and reduced the authorized shares of common stock to 210 million shares. In
connection with the Everett and Seattle Transactions, the number of shares of the Company’s common stock
authorized for issuance under the Plan increased by 67 million. The Plan provides for the grant of various
types of awards including restricted stock awards, stock options, and performance-based awards. These
awards generally vest over three years from the grant date. The Company’s stock-based incentive
compensation program also includes various equity plans assumed through acquisitions under which stock-
based awards are outstanding.

In May 2016, in connection with the announcement of the Everett Transaction, the Company modified its

stock-based compensation program such that certain unvested equity awards outstanding on May 24, 2016
would vest upon the earlier of: (i) the termination of an employee’s employment with HPE as a direct result of
an announced sale, divestiture or spin-off of a subsidiary, division or other business; (ii) the termination of an
employee’s employment with HPE without cause; or (iii) June 1, 2018. This modification also included changes
to the performance and market conditions of certain performance-based awards. The incremental expense
arising from this modification was not material. Additionally, as a result of the accelerated vesting related to this
modification, the Company incurred stock-based compensation expense of $126 million during fiscal 2017, of
which $92 million was recorded in Net loss from discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statement of
Earnings for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2017. The remaining $34 million arising from the modification for
fiscal 2017 has been recorded within Separation costs in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.

Additionally, as permitted by the Plan, in connection with the Everett and Seattle Transactions and in

accordance with the respective Employee Matters Agreements, HPE made certain post-spin adjustments to the
exercise price and number of stock-based compensation awards with the intention of preserving the intrinsic
value of the outstanding awards prior to the close of the transactions. The incremental expense incurred by the
Company related to the Everett and Seattle Transactions was not material.

For the fiscal year ended October 31, 2017, stock-based compensation expense from continuing
operations in the table above includes pre-tax expense of $41 million, which has been recorded within
Separation costs, $33 million related to workforce reductions, which has been recorded within Restructuring
charges, and $23 million related to the acquisitions of Silicon Graphics International Corp. (‘‘SGI’’) and Nimble
Storage, Inc. (‘‘Nimble Storage’’), which has been recorded within Acquisition and other related charges in the
Consolidated Statement of Earnings.

For the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, stock-based compensation expense from continuing
operations in the table above includes pre-tax expense of $33 million, which has been recorded within
Separation costs, and $8 million, related to workforce reductions, which has been recorded within Restructuring
charges, in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.

In connection with the Separation, former Parent’s Board of Directors approved amendments to certain

outstanding long-term incentive awards on July 29, 2015. The amendments provided for the accelerated
vesting on September 17, 2015 of certain stock-based awards that were otherwise scheduled to vest between
September 18, 2015 and December 31, 2015. The incremental pre-tax stock-based compensation expense due
to the acceleration was approximately $61 million in fiscal 2015.

Note 7: Stock-Based Compensation (Continued)

Stock-based compensation expense in the table above includes an allocation of former Parent’s corporate

and shared functional employee expenses of $151 million in fiscal 2015.

Restricted Stock Units

Restricted stock units have forfeitable dividend equivalent rights equal to the dividend paid on common

stock. Restricted stock units do not have the voting rights of common stock, and the shares underlying
restricted stock units are not considered issued and outstanding upon grant. The fair value of the restricted
stock units is the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the grant date of the award. The Company

Note 7: Stock-Based Compensation (Continued)

The total grant date fair value of restricted stock awards vested for Company employees in fiscal 2017,
2016 and 2015 was $472 million, $130 million and $451 million, respectively, net of taxes. As of October 31,
2017, there was $301 million of unrecognized pre-tax stock-based compensation expense related to unvested
restricted stock units, which the Company expects to recognize over the remaining weighted-average vesting
period of 1.2 years.

Stock Options

Stock options granted under the Plan are generally non-qualified stock options, but the Plan permits some
options granted to qualify as incentive stock options under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. The exercise price
of a stock option is equal to the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the option grant date. The
majority of the stock options issued by the Company contain only service vesting conditions. The Company
also issued performance-contingent stock options that vest only on the satisfaction of both service and market
conditions.

The Company and former Parent utilize the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula to estimate the

fair value of stock options subject to service-based vesting conditions. The Company and former Parent
estimate the fair value of stock options subject to performance-contingent vesting conditions using a
combination of a Monte Carlo simulation model and a lattice model, as these awards contain market conditions.
The weighted-average fair value and the assumptions used to measure fair value were as follows:

For fiscal 2017 and 2016, the weighted-average fair value was based on the fair value of stock options
granted under the Plan during the respective periods. For fiscal 2015, the weighted-average fair value
was based on the fair value of stock options granted under former Parent’s Plans during the period.
For options granted in fiscal 2017 and 2016, expected volatility was estimated using the average historical
volatility of selected peer companies. For options granted in fiscal 2015, expected volatility was estimated
using the implied volatility derived from options traded on former Parent’s common stock.
The risk-free interest rate was estimated based on the yield on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues.
The expected dividend yield represents a constant dividend yield applied for the duration of the expected
term of the option.
For options granted in fiscal 2017 and 2016 subject to service-based vesting, the expected term was
estimated using the simplified method detailed in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 110. For options
granted in fiscal 2015 subject to service-based vesting, the expected term was estimated using historical
exercise and post-vesting termination patterns. For performance-contingent options, the expected term
represents an output from the lattice model.

For fiscal 2017, includes approximately 8 million stock options, with a weighted-average exercise price of $16 per share, related to the former ES and Software segments, which
were canceled by HPE in connection with the Everett and Seattle Transactions, and in accordance with the respective Employee Matters Agreements.
Employee transition amounts consist of option activity for employees transitioning between the Company and former Parent.
The weighted average exercise price reflects the impact of the post-spin adjustments to the exercise price related to the Everett and Seattle Transactions.

The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value that option

holders would have realized had all option holders exercised their options on the last trading day of fiscal 2017,
2016 and 2015. For fiscal 2017 and 2016, the aggregate intrinsic value is the difference between the
Company’s closing common stock price on the last trading day of the respective fiscal year and the exercise
price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options. For fiscal 2015, the aggregate intrinsic value is the
difference between former Parent’s closing stock price on the last trading day of the fiscal year and the
exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options. The total intrinsic value of options exercised
in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $218 million, $62 million and $94 million, respectively. The total grant date
fair value of options granted which vested in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $94 million, $18 million and
$38 million, respectively, net of taxes.

As of October 31, 2017, there was $25 million of unrecognized pre-tax stock-based compensation

expense related to stock options, which the Company expects to recognize over the remaining weighted-
average vesting period of 1.2 years.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

Effective November 1, 2015, the Company adopted the Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company 2015

Employee Stock Purchase Plan (‘‘ESPP’’). The total number of shares of Company’s common stock authorized
under the ESPP was 80 million. The ESPP allows eligible employees to contribute up to 10% of their eligible
compensation to purchase Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s common stock. The ESPP provides for a discount not
to exceed 15% and an offering period up to 24 months. The Company currently offers 6-month offering periods
during which employees have the ability to purchase shares at 95% of the closing market price on the
purchase date. No stock-based compensation expense was recorded in connection with those purchases, as
the criteria of a non-compensatory plan were met.

Prior to the Separation, under former Parent’s ESPP, employees could contribute up to 10% of their

eligible compensation, subject to certain income limits, to purchase shares of former Parent’s common stock.
Pursuant to the terms of former Parent’s ESPP, employees purchased stock under the ESPP at a price equal
to 95% of former Parent’s closing stock price on the purchase date. No stock-based compensation expense
was recorded in connection with those purchases because the criteria of a non-compensatory plan were met.

Cash received from option exercises and purchases under the Company’s ESPP was $411 million and

$119 million in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively. The benefit realized for the tax deduction from option
exercises in fiscal 2017 and 2016 was $69 million and $21 million, respectively. Cash received from option
exercises and purchases by Company employees under former Parent’s ESPP was $165 million in fiscal 2015.
The benefit realized for the tax deduction from option exercises in fiscal 2015 was $45 million.

Note 8: Taxes on Earnings

Prior to the Separation, Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s operating results were included in former Parent’s

various consolidated U.S. federal and state income tax returns, as well as non-U.S. tax filings. For the
purposes of the Company’s Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for periods prior to the
Separation, income tax expense and deferred tax balances have been recorded as if the Company filed tax
returns on a standalone basis separate from former Parent. The Separate Return Method applies the
accounting guidance for income taxes to the standalone financial statements as if the Company was a separate
taxpayer and a standalone enterprise for fiscal 2015 and prior.

and Seattle Transactions and $326 million of income tax benefits on restructuring charges, separation costs,
transformation costs and acquisition and other related charges, the effects of which were partially offset by
$473 million of income tax charges to record valuation allowances on U.S. state deferred tax assets, and
$88 million of income tax charges related to pre-Separation tax matters.

In fiscal 2016, the Company recorded $250 million of net income tax charges related to items unique to
the year. These amounts primarily included $714 million of income tax charges related to pre-Separation tax
matters, of which $647 million was related to the effect of the potential settlement of certain pre-Separation
Hewlett-Packard Company income tax liabilities, and $169 million of income tax charges resulting from a gain
on the H3C divestiture, the effects of which were partially offset by $509 million of income tax benefits on
restructuring charges, separation costs and acquisition and other related charges, and $124 million of income
tax benefits resulting from a gain on the MphasiS divestiture.

In fiscal 2015, the Company recorded $1.7 billion of net income tax benefits related to items unique to the

year. These amounts primarily included $1.8 billion of income tax benefits due to a release of valuation
allowances pertaining to certain U.S. state deferred tax assets, $139 million of income tax benefits related to
restructuring charges and separation costs, and $67 million of income tax benefits related to uncertain tax
positions, the effects of which were partially offset by $486 million of income tax charges to record valuation
allowances on certain foreign deferred tax assets and $229 million of income tax charges related to state tax
impacts of the separation of deferred taxes under the Separate Return Method.

As a result of certain employment actions and capital investments the Company has undertaken, income

from manufacturing and services in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates, and in some cases is
wholly exempt from taxes, through 2024. The gross income tax benefits attributable to these actions and
investments were estimated to be $378 million ($0.23 diluted net EPS) in fiscal 2017, $401 million ($0.23
diluted net EPS) in fiscal 2016 and $260 million ($0.14 diluted net EPS) in fiscal 2015. Refer Note 18, ‘‘Net
Earnings Per Share’’ for details on shares used to compute diluted net EPS.

Up to $3.0 billion, $2.7 billion and $0.2 billion of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s unrecognized tax benefits at

October 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, would affect the Company’s effective tax rate if realized. The
$149 million decrease in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits for the year ended October 31, 2017, is
primarily related to the settlement of a foreign tax audit concerning an intercompany transaction, partially offset

by unrecognized tax benefits related to the timing of intercompany royalty revenue recognition, which does not
affect the Company’s effective tax rate.

For fiscal 2015, the unrecognized tax benefits reflected in the Company’s Consolidated and Combined

Financial Statements have been determined using the Separate Return Method. The $6.5 billion increase in the
amount of unrecognized tax benefits for the year ended October 31, 2016, is primarily related to certain
pre-Separation income tax liabilities for which the Company is joint and severally liable under the Tax Matters
Agreement entered in to with HP Inc. effective November 1, 2015, as well as the unrecognized tax benefits
related to the timing of intercompany royalty revenue recognition, which does not affect the Company’s
effective tax rate.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise recognizes interest income from favorable settlements and interest expense

and penalties accrued on unrecognized tax benefits in Benefit (provision) for taxes in the Consolidated and
Combined Statements of Earnings. The Company had accrued $304 million and $197 million for interest and
penalties as of October 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise engages in continuous discussion and negotiation with taxing authorities

regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions. Hewlett Packard Enterprise does not expect complete resolution
of any U.S. Internal Revenue Service (‘‘IRS’’) audit cycle within the next 12 months. However, it is reasonably
possible that certain federal, foreign and state tax issues may be concluded in the next 12 months, including
resolution of certain intercompany transactions, joint and several tax liabilities and other matters. Accordingly,
Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes it is reasonably possible that its existing unrecognized tax benefits may be
reduced by an amount up to $2.7 billion within the next 12 months.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise is subject to income tax in the U.S. and approximately 120 other countries

and is subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions.

With respect to major foreign tax jurisdictions, HPE is no longer subject to tax authority examinations for
years prior to 2005. HPE was subject to a foreign tax audit concerning an intercompany transaction for fiscal
2009 which the Company settled with the relevant taxing authority for $456 million during the third quarter of
fiscal 2017. The settlement amount is due to be paid in semi-annual installments over the next three fiscal
years. With respect to major state tax jurisdictions, HPE is no longer subject to tax authority examinations for
years prior to 2003.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes it has provided adequate reserves for all tax deficiencies or

reductions in tax benefits that could result from federal, state and foreign tax audits. The Company regularly
assesses the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of the Company’s tax
provision. The Company adjusts its uncertain tax positions to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements,
rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular audit. However,
income tax audits are inherently unpredictable and there can be no assurance that the Company will accurately
predict the outcome of these audits. The amounts ultimately paid on resolution of an audit could be materially
different from the amounts previously included in the Provision for taxes and therefore the resolution of one or
more of these uncertainties in any particular period could have a material impact on net earnings or cash flows.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise is joint and severally liable for certain pre-Separation tax liabilities of HP Inc.

HP Inc. is subject to numerous ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. The IRS is
conducting an audit of former Parent’s 2009 - 2015 income tax returns. HP Inc. has received from the
IRS Notices of Deficiency for its fiscal 1999 - 2000 and 2003 - 2005 tax years, and RARs for its fiscal
2001 - 2002 and 2006 - 2008 tax years.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise has not provided for U.S. federal income and foreign withholding taxes on

$12 billion of undistributed earnings from non-U.S. operations as of October 31, 2017 because the Company

intends to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside of the U.S. The undistributed earnings from non-U.S.
operations has decreased from October 31, 2016 due to the Everett and Seattle Transactions and utilization of
such earnings to fund losses of non-U.S. subsidiaries. If the Company were to distribute these earnings, foreign
tax credits may become available under current law to reduce the resulting U.S. income tax liability.
Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these earnings is not practicable.
The Company will remit non-indefinitely reinvested earnings of its non-U.S. subsidiaries for which deferred U.S.
federal and withholding taxes have been provided where excess cash has accumulated and the Company
determines that it is advantageous for business operations, tax or cash management reasons.

Deferred Income Taxes

Deferred income taxes result from temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities

recognized for financial reporting and tax purposes.

The significant components of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities were as follows:

Note 8: Taxes on Earnings (Continued)

The Company periodically engages in intercompany advanced royalty payment and licensing

arrangements that may result in advance payments between subsidiaries in different tax jurisdictions. When the
local tax treatment of the intercompany licensing arrangements differs from U.S. GAAP treatment, deferred
taxes are recognized. Hewlett Packard Enterprise executed intercompany advanced royalty payment
arrangements resulting in advanced payments of $439 million and $3.7 billion during fiscal 2017 and 2016,
respectively. In these transactions, the payments were received in the U.S. from a foreign consolidated affiliate,
with a deferral of intercompany revenues over the term of the arrangements, approximately 15 years and
5 years, respectively. Intercompany royalty revenue and the amortization expense related to the licensing rights
are eliminated in consolidation.

As of October 31, 2017, the Company had $1.0 billion, $1.5 billion and $7.7 billion of federal, state and

foreign net operating loss carry-forwards, respectively. Amounts included in state, foreign and federal net
operating loss carry-forwards will begin to expire in 2018, 2019, and 2030, respectively. Hewlett Packard
Enterprise has provided a valuation allowance of $108 million and $1.4 billion for deferred tax assets related to
state and foreign net operating losses carry-forwards, respectively.

As of October 31, 2017, Hewlett Packard Enterprise had recorded deferred tax assets for various tax

credit carry-forwards as follows:

U.S. foreign tax credits . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Total valuation allowances increased by $694 million in fiscal 2017, due primarily to the valuation

allowance recorded against foreign deferred tax assets related to loss carry-forwards and increases in U.S.
domestic valuation allowances on deferred taxes related to state operations. Total valuation allowances
increased by $523 million in fiscal 2016 due primarily to the valuation allowance recorded against foreign
deferred tax assets related to pension assets and liabilities, partially offset by decreases in foreign deferred tax
assets for net operating losses.

Tax Matters Agreement and Other Income Tax Matters

In connection with the Separation, the Company entered into a Tax Matters Agreement with HP Inc.,
formerly Hewlett-Packard Company. In connection with the Everett and Seattle Transactions, the company
entered into a DXC Tax Matters Agreement with DXC and a Micro Focus Tax Matters Agreement with Micro
Focus, respectively. See Note 20, ‘‘Guarantees, Indemnifications and Warranties’’, for a description of the Tax

Note 10: Financing Receivables and Operating Leases (Continued)

During the second quarter of fiscal 2017, in connection with the Everett Transaction, the Company

converted certain capital lease arrangements with the former ES segment to operating lease assets held by
FS. The decrease in financing receivables during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2017 in the table above is
due primarily to this conversion of capital leases to operating leases.

As of October 31, 2017, scheduled maturities of the Company’s minimum lease payments receivable were

as follows:

Sale of Financing Receivables

During the fiscal years ended October 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company entered into arrangements to
transfer the contractual payments due under certain financing receivables to third party financial institutions,
which are accounted for as sales in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (‘‘ASC’’) 860—
Transfers and Servicing. The Company derecognizes the carrying value of the receivable transferred and
recognizes a net gain or loss on the sale. During the fiscal years ended October 31, 2017 and 2016, the
Company sold $130 million and $124 million, respectively, of financing receivables. The gains recognized on
the sales of financing receivables were not material for the periods presented.

Credit Quality Indicators

Due to the homogeneous nature of its leasing transactions, the Company manages its financing

receivables on an aggregate basis when assessing and monitoring credit risk. Credit risk is generally diversified
due to the large number of entities comprising the Company’s customer base and their dispersion across many
different industries and geographic regions. The Company evaluates the credit quality of an obligor at lease
inception and monitors that credit quality over the term of a transaction. The Company assigns risk ratings to
each lease based on the creditworthiness of the obligor and other variables that augment or mitigate the
inherent credit risk of a particular transaction. Such variables include the underlying value and liquidity of the
collateral, the essential use of the equipment, the term of the lease, and the inclusion of credit enhancements,
such as guarantees, letters of credit or security deposits.

The credit risk profile of gross financing receivables, based on internal risk ratings, was as follows:

Risk Rating:

Low . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Accounts rated low risk typically have the equivalent of a Standard & Poor’s rating of BBBⳮ or higher,
while accounts rated moderate risk generally have the equivalent of BB+ or lower. The Company classifies
accounts as high risk when it considers the financing receivable to be impaired or when management believes
there is a significant near-term risk of impairment.

The allowance for doubtful accounts for financing receivables is comprised of a general reserve and a
specific reserve. The Company maintains general reserve percentages on a regional basis and bases such
percentages on several factors, including consideration of historical credit losses and portfolio delinquencies,
trends in the overall weighted-average risk rating of the portfolio, current economic conditions and information
derived from competitive benchmarking. The Company excludes accounts evaluated as part of the specific
reserve from the general reserve analysis. The Company establishes a specific reserve for financing
receivables with identified exposures, such as customer defaults, bankruptcy or other events, that make it
unlikely the Company will recover its investment. For individually evaluated receivables, the Company
determines the expected cash flow for the receivable, which includes consideration of estimated proceeds from
disposition of the collateral, and calculates an estimate of the potential loss and the probability of loss. For
those accounts where a loss is considered probable, the Company records a specific reserve. The Company
generally writes off a receivable or records a specific reserve when a receivable becomes 180 days past due,
or sooner if the Company determines that the receivable is not collectible.

The allowance for doubtful accounts related to financing receivables and changes therein were as follows:

Non-Accrual and Past-Due Financing Receivables

The Company considers a financing receivable to be past due when the minimum payment is not

received by the contractually specified due date. The Company generally places financing receivables on
non-accrual status, which is the suspension of interest accrual, and considers such receivables to be
non-performing at the earlier of the time at which full payment of principal and interest becomes doubtful or the
receivable becomes 90 days past due. Subsequently, the Company may recognize revenue on non-accrual
financing receivables as payments are received, which is on a cash basis, if the Company deems the recorded
financing receivable to be fully collectible; however, if there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectability of the
recorded financing receivable, all cash receipts are applied to the carrying amount of the financing receivable,
which is the cost recovery method. In certain circumstances, such as when the Company deems a delinquency
to be of an administrative nature, financing receivables may accrue interest after becoming 90 days past due.
The non-accrual status of a financing receivable may not impact a customer’s risk rating. After all of a

and income based taxes, and residual goodwill, which are subject to change within the measurement period as
valuations are finalized. Measurement period adjustments are recorded in the reporting period in which the
estimates are finalized and adjustment amounts are determined.

Pro forma results of operations for these acquisitions have not been presented because they are not

material to the Company’s consolidated results of operations, either individually or in the aggregate. Goodwill,
which represents the excess of the purchase price over the net tangible and intangible assets acquired, is not
deductible for tax purposes.

Divestitures in Fiscal 2016

In fiscal 2016, the Company completed three divestitures, which resulted in $3.0 billion of net proceeds.

These divestitures primarily represent the sale of the Company’s controlling interest in H3C and MphasiS,
which are discussed further below. The gains associated with the sale of the Company’s controlling interest in
H3C and MphasiS are included in Gain on H3C and MphasiS divestitures in the Consolidated Statement of
Earnings for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016.

In May 2016, the Company executed its joint partnership agreement with Tsinghua Holdings to bring

together the Chinese enterprise technology assets of the Company and Tsinghua University to create a
Chinese business provider of technology infrastructure. Under the definitive agreement, Tsinghua Holdings’
subsidiary, Unisplendour Corporation, purchased 51% of the new business named H3C for $2.6 billion, which
includes purchase consideration adjustments. H3C is comprised of the Company’s former H3C Technologies
and China-based server, storage and technology services businesses (‘‘H3C disposal group’’), which were
previously reported within the EG segment until the time of the sale. As a result of the H3C divestiture, the
Company recognized a gain of $2.2 billion. The Company’s remaining China subsidiary maintains 100%
ownership of its existing China-based Enterprise Services, Software and Helion Cloud businesses. The new
H3C is the exclusive provider of the Company’s server and storage portfolio, as well as the Company’s
exclusive hardware support services provider in China, customized for that market.

The results of the H3C disposal group, which represented 100% of the Company’s H3C Technologies and

China-based server, storage and technology services businesses, were reflected in the Company’s
Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements through the date of closing. The pre-tax earnings for the
fiscal years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 were $182 million and $286 million, respectively. The
Company’s remaining 49% ownership is accounted for under the equity method of accounting, and its
proportionate share of H3C’s earnings are included in Loss from equity interests in the Consolidated and
Combined Statements of Earnings. See Note 22, ‘‘Equity Method Investments’’ for additional information.

In April 2016, the Company signed a definitive agreement with The Blackstone Group to sell the

Company’s equity stake in MphasiS Limited, an IT services provider headquartered in Bangalore, India, for
Indian Rupees (‘‘INR’’) 430 per share. On September 1, 2016, the Company closed the MphasiS divestiture by
selling its full equity stake, which was valued at $824 million at the purchase price of INR 430 per share. As a
result of the MphasiS divestiture, the Company recognized a gain of $253 million.

Acquisitions in Fiscal 2015

In fiscal 2015, the Company completed four acquisitions. The following table presents the aggregate

For fiscal 2017, the increase in gross intangible assets was due primarily to $688 million of purchases
related to acquisitions, partially offset by $384 million of intangible assets which became fully amortized and
were eliminated from gross intangible assets and accumulated amortization. Intangible asset amortization
expense for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2017 was $321 million.

For fiscal 2016, the decrease in gross intangible assets was due primarily to $189 million of intangible

assets which became fully amortized and were eliminated from gross intangible assets and accumulated
amortization, and $355 million of intangible assets that were divested, of which $293 million was accumulated
amortization. The decrease was partially offset by $7 million of purchases related to an acquisition. Intangible
asset amortization expense for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016 was $272 million.

In-process research and development consists of efforts that are in process on the date the Company

acquires a business. Under the accounting guidance for intangible assets, in-process research and
development acquired in a business combination is considered an indefinite-lived intangible asset until
completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts. The Company begins
amortizing its in-process research and development intangible assets upon completion of the projects. If an
in-process research and development project is abandoned, the Company records an expense for the value of
the related intangible asset to its Consolidated and Combined Statement of Earnings in the period of
abandonment. The Company reclassified in-process research and development assets acquired of $10 million
and $159 million to developed and core technology and patents as the projects were completed, and began
amortization during fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively.

As of October 31, 2017, the weighted-average remaining useful lives of the Company’s finite-lived

intangible assets were as follows:

Note 13: Fair Value

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an

exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.

Fair Value Hierarchy

The Company uses valuation techniques that are based upon observable and unobservable inputs.
Observable inputs are developed using market data such as publicly available information and reflect the
assumptions market participants would use, while unobservable inputs are developed using the best
information available about the assumptions market participants would use. Assets and liabilities are classified
in the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement:

Level 1—Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2—Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or

similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are
observable for the asset or liability and market-corroborated inputs.

Level 3—Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to observable inputs and lowest priority to unobservable

inputs.

Valuation Techniques

Cash Equivalents and Investments: The Company holds time deposits, money market funds, debt

securities primarily consisting of corporate and foreign government notes and bonds, and equity securities. The
Company values cash equivalents and equity investments using quoted market prices, alternative pricing
sources, including net asset value, or models utilizing market observable inputs. The fair value of debt
investments was based on quoted market prices or model-driven valuations using inputs primarily derived from
or corroborated by observable market data, and, in certain instances, valuation models that utilize assumptions
which cannot be corroborated with observable market data.

Derivative Instruments: The Company uses forward contracts, interest rate and total return swaps to
hedge certain foreign currency and interest rate exposures. The Company uses industry standard valuation
models to measure fair value. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future
amounts to present value using market-based observable inputs, including interest rate curves, the Company
and counterparties’ credit risk, foreign currency exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for currencies and
interest rates. See Note 14, ‘‘Financial Instruments’’, for a further discussion of the Company’s use of derivative
instruments.

Note 13: Fair Value (Continued)

Other Fair Value Disclosures

Short- and Long-Term Debt: The Company estimates the fair value of its debt primarily using an

expected present value technique, which is based on observable market inputs using interest rates currently
available to companies of similar credit standing for similar terms and remaining maturities, and considering its
own credit risk. The portion of the Company’s debt that is hedged is reflected in the Consolidated Balance
Sheets as an amount equal to the debt’s carrying amount and a fair value adjustment representing changes in
the fair value of the hedged debt obligations arising from movements in benchmark interest rates. At
October 31, 2017, the estimated fair value of the Company’s short-term and long-term debt was $14.6 billion
and the carrying value was $14.0 billion. As of October 31, 2016, the estimated fair value of the Company’s
short-term and long-term debt was $16.3 billion and the carrying value was $15.7 billion. If measured at fair
value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, short-term and long-term debt would be classified in Level 2 of the
fair value hierarchy.

Other Financial Instruments: For the balance of the Company’s financial instruments, primarily accounts

receivable, accounts payable and financial liabilities included in other accrued liabilities, the carrying amounts
approximate fair value due to their short maturities. If measured at fair value in the Consolidated Balance
Sheets, these other financial instruments would be classified in Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

Non-Marketable Equity Investments and Non-Financial Assets: The Company’s non-marketable equity
investments and non-financial assets, such as intangible assets, goodwill and property, plant and equipment,
are recorded at fair value in the period an impairment charge is recognized. If measured at fair value in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets, these would generally be classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 14: Financial Instruments (Continued)

All highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the date of acquisition are

considered cash equivalents. As of October 31, 2017 and 2016, the carrying amount of cash equivalents
approximated fair value due to the short period of time to maturity. Interest income related to cash, cash
equivalents and debt securities was approximately $104 million in fiscal 2017, $105 million in fiscal 2016 and
$54 million in fiscal 2015. Time deposits were primarily issued by institutions outside the U.S. as of October 31,
2017 and 2016. The estimated fair value of the available-for-sale investments may not be representative of
values that will be realized in the future.

The gross unrealized loss as of October 31, 2017 and 2016 was due primarily to a decline in the fair

value of a debt security of $11 million and $12 million, respectively, that has been in a continuous loss position
for more than twelve months. The Company does not intend to sell this debt security, and it is not likely that
the Company will be required to sell this debt security prior to the recovery of the amortized cost.

Contractual maturities of investments in available-for-sale debt securities were as follows:

Equity securities in privately held companies that are accounted for as cost basis investments are

included in Long-term financing receivables and other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These
investments amounted to $149 million and $128 million at October 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Investments in equity securities that are accounted for using the equity method are included in

Investments in equity interests in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. These amounted to $2.5 billion and
$2.6 billion at October 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. For additional information, see Note 22, ‘‘Equity
Method Investments’’.

Derivative Instruments

The Company is a global company exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and interest

rate changes in the normal course of its business. As part of its risk management strategy, the Company uses
derivative instruments, primarily forward contracts, interest rate swaps and total return swaps to hedge certain
foreign currency, interest rate and, to a lesser extent, equity exposures. The Company’s objective is to offset
gains and losses resulting from these exposures with losses and gains on the derivative contracts used to
hedge them, thereby reducing volatility of earnings or protecting the fair value of assets and liabilities. The
Company does not have any leveraged derivatives and does not use derivative contracts for speculative
purposes. The Company may designate its derivative contracts as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or
hedges of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation (‘‘net investment hedges’’).
Additionally, for derivatives not designated as hedging instruments, the Company categorizes those economic
hedges as other derivatives. Derivative instruments directly attributable to the Company are recognized at fair
value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The change in fair value of the derivative instruments is recognized
in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Earnings or Consolidated and Combined Statements of
Comprehensive Income depending upon the type of hedge as further discussed below. The Company classifies
cash flows from its derivative programs with the activities that correspond to the underlying hedged items in the
Consolidated and Combined Statements of Cash Flows.

As a result of its use of derivative instruments, the Company is exposed to the risk that its counterparties
will fail to meet their contractual obligations. To mitigate counterparty credit risk, the Company has a policy of
only entering into derivative contracts with carefully selected major financial institutions based on their credit

Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 14: Financial Instruments (Continued)

ratings and other factors, and the Company maintains dollar risk limits that correspond to each financial
institution’s credit rating and other factors. The Company’s established policies and procedures for mitigating
credit risk include reviewing and establishing limits for credit exposure and periodically reassessing the
creditworthiness of its counterparties. Master netting agreements also mitigate credit exposure to counterparties
by permitting the Company to net amounts due from the Company to a counterparty against amounts due to
the Company from the same counterparty under certain conditions.

To further mitigate credit exposure to counterparties, the Company has collateral security agreements,

which allows the Company to hold collateral from, or require the Company to post collateral to, counterparties
when aggregate derivative fair values exceed contractually established thresholds which are generally based
on the credit ratings of the Company and its counterparties. If the Company’s credit rating falls below a
specified credit rating, the counterparty has the right to request full collateralization of the derivatives’ net
liability position. Conversely, if the counterparty’s credit rating falls below a specified credit rating, the Company
has the right to request full collateralization of the derivatives’ net liability position. Collateral is generally posted
within two business days. The fair value of the Company’s derivatives with credit contingent features in a net
liability position was $265 million and $9 million at October 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, all of which were
fully collateralized within two business days.

Under the Company’s derivative contracts, the counterparty can terminate all outstanding trades following
a covered change of control event affecting the Company that results in the surviving entity being rated below
a specified credit rating. This credit contingent provision did not affect the Company’s financial position or cash
flows as of October 31, 2017 and 2016.

Fair Value Hedges

The Company issues long-term debt in U.S. dollars based on market conditions at the time of financing.

The Company may enter into fair value hedges, such as interest rate swaps, to reduce the exposure of its debt
portfolio to changes in fair value resulting from changes in interest rates by achieving a primarily U.S. dollar
LIBOR-based floating interest rate. The swap transactions generally involve principal and interest obligations for
U.S. dollar-denominated amounts. Alternatively, the Company may choose not to swap fixed for floating interest
payments or may terminate a previously executed swap if it believes a larger proportion of fixed-rate debt
would be beneficial. When investing in fixed-rate instruments, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps
that convert the fixed interest payments into variable interest payments and may designate these swaps as fair
value hedges.

For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, the Company recognizes

the change in fair value of the derivative instrument, as well as the offsetting change in the fair value of the
hedged item, in Interest and other, net in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Earnings in the period
of change.

Cash Flow Hedges

The Company uses forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign
currency exchange rate risks inherent in its forecasted net revenue and, to a lesser extent, cost of sales,
operating expenses, and intercompany loans denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The
Company’s foreign currency cash flow hedges mature generally within twelve months; however, forward
contracts associated with sales-type and direct-financing leases and intercompany loans extend for the duration
of the lease or loan term, which typically range from two to five years.

For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the Company initially

records changes in fair value for the effective portion of the derivative instrument in Accumulated other
comprehensive loss as a separate component of equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and subsequently

Note 14: Financial Instruments (Continued)

reclassifies these amounts into earnings in the period during which the hedged transaction is recognized in
earnings. The Company reports the effective portion of its cash flow hedges in the same financial statement
line item as changes in the fair value of the hedged item.

Net Investment Hedges

The Company uses forward contracts designated as net investment hedges to hedge net investments in

certain foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is the local currency. The Company records the effective
portion of such derivative instruments together with changes in the fair value of the hedged items in Cumulative
translation adjustment as a separate component of Equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Other Derivatives

Other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist primarily of forward contracts used to
hedge foreign currency-denominated balance sheet exposures. The Company also uses total return swaps
and, to a lesser extent, interest rate swaps, based on equity or fixed income indices, to hedge its executive
deferred compensation plan liability.

For derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, the Company recognizes changes in
fair value of the derivative instrument, as well as the offsetting change in the fair value of the hedged item, in
Interest and other, net in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Earnings in the period of change.

Hedge Effectiveness

For interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges, the Company measures hedge effectiveness by

offsetting the change in fair value of the hedged items with the change in fair value of the derivative. For
forward contracts designated as cash flow or net investment hedges, the Company measures hedge
effectiveness by comparing the cumulative change in fair value of the hedge contract with the cumulative
change in fair value of the hedged item, both of which are based on forward rates. The Company recognizes
any ineffective portion of the hedge in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Earnings in the same
period in which ineffectiveness occurs. Amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized
in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Earnings in the period they arise.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise Senior Notes

On October 9, 2015, Hewlett Packard Enterprise completed its offering of $14.0 billion of fixed rate notes
and $0.6 billion of floating rate notes, with the interest rate and maturity date described in the table above. The
Notes are Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with
all of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness. Hewlett Packard
Enterprise distributed approximately $14.5 billion of net proceeds from the Notes offering to HP Co.

On December 30, 2016, Hewlett Packard Enterprise exchanged new registered Notes for all of the

outstanding $14.6 billion of unregistered Senior Notes. The terms of the new registered Notes in the exchange
offer are substantially identical to the terms of the previously unregistered Senior Notes, except that the new
Notes are registered under the Securities Act, and certain transfer restrictions, registration rights and additional
interest provisions relating to the outstanding Senior Notes do not apply to the new Notes.

On April 28, 2017, the Company used a portion of the $3.0 billion cash dividend received from Everett to
redeem $1.5 billion face value of the 2.450% Senior Notes with an original maturity date of October 5, 2017. A
proportional amount of unamortized discount and debt issuance costs were allocated to the retired debt. These
costs, along with the redemption price of $1.5 billion resulted in an immaterial loss.

On September 20, 2017, Hewlett Packard Enterprise completed its offering of $1.1 billion of new 2.100%

registered notes due October 4, 2019. The Company used the net proceeds to fund the repayment of the
remaining $750 million outstanding principal amount of its 2.450% notes due October 5, 2017 and the
repayment of the $350 million outstanding principal amount of its floating rate notes due October 5, 2017.

As disclosed in Note 14, ‘‘Financial Instruments’’, the Company uses interest rate swaps to mitigate the
exposure of its debt portfolio to changes in fair value resulting from changes in interest rates by achieving a
primarily U.S. dollar LIBOR-based floating interest rate. As of October 31, 2017, the Company entered into
interest rate swaps to reduce the exposure of $9.5 billion of aggregate principal amount of fixed rate Senior
Notes to changes in fair value resulting from changes in interest rates by achieving LIBOR-based floating
interest rate. Interest rates on long-term debt in the table above have not been adjusted to reflect the impact of
any interest rate swaps.

Commercial Paper

Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s Board of Directors has authorized the issuance of up to $4.0 billion in

aggregate principal amount of commercial paper by Hewlett Packard Enterprise. Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s
subsidiaries are authorized to issue up to an additional $500 million in aggregate principal amount of
commercial paper. Hewlett Packard Enterprise maintains two commercial paper programs, and a wholly-owned

subsidiary maintains a third program. Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s U.S. program provides for the issuance of
U.S. dollar-denominated commercial paper up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $4.0 billion.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s euro commercial paper program provides for the issuance of commercial paper
outside of the U.S. denominated in U.S. dollars, euros or British pounds up to a maximum aggregate principal
amount of $3.0 billion or the equivalent in those alternative currencies. The combined aggregate principal
amount of commercial paper outstanding under those programs at any one time cannot exceed the $4.0 billion
authorized by Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s Board of Directors. The Hewlett Packard Enterprise subsidiary’s
euro Commercial Paper/Certificate of Deposit Program provides for the issuance of commercial paper in
various currencies of up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $500 million. As of October 31, 2017 and
2016, no borrowings were outstanding under Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s two commercial paper programs,
and $401 million and $326 million, respectively, were outstanding under the subsidiary’s program.

Revolving Credit Facility

On November 1, 2015, the Company entered into a revolving credit facility (the ‘‘Credit Agreement’’),
together with the lenders named therein, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (‘‘JPMorgan’’), as co-administrative
agent and administrative processing agent, and Citibank, N.A., as co-administrative agent, providing for a
senior, unsecured revolving credit facility with aggregate lending commitments of $4.0 billion. Loans under the
revolving credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes. Commitments under the Credit Agreement
are available for a period of five years, which period may be extended, subject to satisfaction of certain
conditions, by up to two, one-year periods. Commitment Fees, interest rates and other terms of borrowing
under the credit facility vary based on Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s external credit rating. As of October 31,
2017 and 2016, no borrowings were outstanding under the Credit Agreement.

Future Maturities of Long-term Debt

As of October 31, 2017, aggregate future maturities of the Company’s long-term debt at face value

(excluding a fair value adjustment related to hedged debt of $142 million and a net discount on debt issuance
of $10 million), including capital lease obligations were as follows:

Note 16: Related Party Transactions and Former Parent Company Investment

Prior to November 1, 2015, the Company consisted of the enterprise technology infrastructure, software,

services, and financing businesses of former Parent and thus, transactions with former Parent were considered
related party transactions. Following the Separation, the Company became an independent publicly-traded
company. As a result, transactions with HP Inc. are no longer considered related party transactions.

On October 31, 2015 and November 1, 2015, in connection with the Separation, the Company entered

into several agreements with former Parent that govern the relationship between the Company and former
Parent following the Distribution, including the following:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

Transition Services Agreement;

Tax Matters Agreement;

Employee Matters Agreement;

Real Estate Matters Agreement;

Master Commercial Agreement; and

Information Technology Service Agreement.

These agreements provided for the allocation between the Company and former Parent’s assets,

employees, liabilities, and obligations (including its investments, property and employee benefits and tax-related
assets and liabilities) attributable to periods prior to, at and after the Separation. Obligations under the service
and commercial contracts generally extend through five years.

Final Cash Allocation from former Parent

In December 2015, in connection with the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Company received
a net cash allocation of $526 million from former Parent. The cash allocation was based on the projected cash
requirements of the Company, in light of the intended investment grade credit rating, business plan and
anticipated operations and activities.

Purchases from former Parent

During fiscal 2015, the Company purchased equipment from other businesses of former Parent in the

amount of $1.3 billion.

Net Transfers from former Parent

Former Parent historically used a centralized approach to cash management and the financing of its

operations. Prior to the Separation, transactions between the Company and former Parent were considered to
be effectively settled for cash at the time the transaction was recorded. The net effect of these transactions is
included in Net transfer from former Parent in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Cash Flows.

Transactions with DXC and Micro Focus

Prior to April 1, 2017, the Company’s operations were organized into five segments for financial reporting
purposes, which included the former Enterprise Services segment, and therefore, transactions with the segment
were considered related party transactions. On April 1, 2017, HPE completed the Everett Transaction. As a
result, transactions with DXC are no longer considered related party transactions. Following April 1, 2017, but
prior to September 1, 2017, the Company’s operations were organized into four segments for financial reporting
purposes, which included the former Software segment, and therefore, transactions with that segment were
considered related party transactions. On September 1, 2017, HPE completed the Seattle Transaction. As a
result, transactions with Micro Focus are no longer considered related party transactions. For further
information, see Note 2, ‘‘Discontinued Operations’’.

Dividends

On November 11, 2015, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a regular quarterly cash dividend
for its common stock. The stockholders of HPE common stock are entitled to receive dividends when and as
declared by HPE’s Board of Directors. Dividends declared were $0.26 per common share in fiscal 2017 and
$0.22 per common share in fiscal 2016.

Share Repurchase Program

On October 13, 2015, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program with an

authorization of $3.0 billion, which was refreshed with additional share repurchase authorizations of $3.0 billion
and $5.0 billion on May 24, 2016 and October 16, 2017, respectively. The Company’s share repurchase
program authorizes both open market and private repurchase transactions and does not have a specific
expiration date. The Company may choose to repurchase shares when sufficient liquidity exists and the shares
are trading at a discount relative to estimated intrinsic value.

The Company entered into two separate accelerated share repurchase agreements (‘‘ASR Agreements’’)

with financial institutions in November 2015 and May 2016. Under the ASR agreements, the Company paid
upfront amounts of $1,075 million and $1,450 million, respectively. For fiscal 2016, the Company retired a total
of 158 million shares as a result of its share repurchase program, which included purchases of 148 million
shares under the ASR Agreements with the remainder under open market repurchases. The 158 million shares
were retired and recorded as a $2.7 billion reduction to stockholder’s equity. For fiscal 2017, the Company
repurchased and retired 136 million shares as a result of its share repurchase program and recorded a
$2.6 billion reduction to stockholders’ equity. Share repurchases settled in fiscal 2017 were open market
purchases. As of October 31, 2017, the Company had unsettled open market repurchases of 1.7 million
shares, which were recorded as a $24 million reduction to stockholders’ equity. As of October 31, 2017, the
Company had a remaining authorization of $5.8 billion for future share repurchases.

Note 18: Net Earnings Per Share

The Company calculates basic net EPS using net earnings and the weighted-average number of shares

outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted net EPS includes the weighted-average dilutive effect of
restricted stock units, stock options, and performance-based awards.

For fiscal 2015, the Company calculated the weighted-average dilutive effect of employee stock plans
after conversion by multiplying the dilutive Hewlett-Packard Company stock-based awards attributable to
Hewlett Packard Enterprise employees for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015 by the price conversion
ratio used to convert those awards to equivalent units of Hewlett Packard Enterprise awards on the
Separation date. The price conversion ratio was calculated using the closing price of Hewlett-Packard
Company common shares on October 31, 2015 divided by the opening price of Hewlett Packard
Enterprise common shares on November 2, 2015.
U.S. GAAP requires the denominator used in the diluted net EPS calculation for discontinued operations
to be the same as that of continuing operations, regardless of net earnings (loss) from continuing
operations.
The Company excludes shares potentially issuable under employee stock plans that could dilute basic net
EPS in the future from the calculation of diluted net earnings (loss) per share, as their effect, if included,
would have been anti-dilutive for the periods presented. For the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015, the
Company’s anti-dilutive shares were calculated by multiplying the anti-dilutive Hewlett-Packard Company
stock-based awards attributable to Hewlett Packard Enterprise employees for the fiscal year ended
October 31, 2015 by the price conversion ratio used to convert those awards to equivalent units of
Hewlett Packard Enterprise awards on the Separation date. The price conversion ratio was calculated
using the closing price of Hewlett-Packard Company common shares on October 31, 2015 divided by the
opening price of Hewlett Packard Enterprise common shares on November 2, 2015.

matters, which arise in the ordinary course of business. In addition, as part of the Separation and Distribution
Agreement, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. (formerly known as ‘‘Hewlett-Packard Company’’) agreed
to cooperate with each other in managing certain existing litigation related to both parties’ businesses. The
Separation and Distribution Agreement included provisions that allocate liability and financial responsibility for
pending litigation involving the parties, as well as provide for cross-indemnification of the parties against
liabilities to one party arising out of liabilities allocated to the other party. The Separation and Distribution
Agreement also included provisions that assign to the parties responsibility for managing pending and future
litigation related to the general corporate matters of HP Inc. arising prior to the Separation. Hewlett Packard
Enterprise records a liability when it believes that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the
amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine both the probability
of having incurred a liability and the estimated amount of the liability. Hewlett Packard Enterprise reviews these
matters at least quarterly and adjusts these liabilities to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings,
advice of legal counsel and other updated information and events pertaining to a particular matter. Litigation is
inherently unpredictable. However, Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes it has valid defenses with respect to
legal matters pending against us. Nevertheless, cash flows or results of operations could be materially affected
in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these contingencies. Hewlett Packard Enterprise
believes it has recorded adequate provisions for any such matters and, as of October 31, 2017, it was not
reasonably possible that a material loss had been incurred in connection with such matters in excess of the
amounts recognized in its financial statements.

Litigation, Proceedings and Investigations

India Directorate of Revenue Intelligence Proceedings. On April 30 and May 10, 2010, the India

Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (the ‘‘DRI’’) issued show cause notices to Hewlett-Packard India Sales
Private Ltd (‘‘HP India’’), a subsidiary of HP Inc., seven HP India employees and one former HP India
employee alleging that HP India underpaid customs duties while importing products and spare parts into India
and seeking to recover an aggregate of approximately $370 million, plus penalties. Prior to the issuance of the
show cause notices, HP India deposited approximately $16 million with the DRI and agreed to post a
provisional bond in exchange for the DRI’s agreement to not seize HP India products and spare parts and to
not interrupt the transaction of business by HP India.

On April 11, 2012, the Bangalore Commissioner of Customs issued an order on the products-related show
cause notice affirming certain duties and penalties against HP India and the named individuals of approximately
$386 million, of which HP India had already deposited $9 million. On December 11, 2012, HP India voluntarily
deposited an additional $10 million in connection with the products-related show cause notice. On April 20,
2012, the Commissioner issued an order on the parts-related show cause notice affirming certain duties and
penalties against HP India and certain of the named individuals of approximately $17 million, of which HP India
had already deposited $7 million. After the order, HP India deposited an additional $3 million in connection with
the parts-related show cause notice so as to avoid certain penalties.

HP India filed appeals of the Commissioner’s orders before the Customs Tribunal along with applications

for waiver of the pre-deposit of remaining demand amounts as a condition for hearing the appeals. The
Customs Department has also filed cross-appeals before the Customs Tribunal. On January 24, 2013, the
Customs Tribunal ordered HP India to deposit an additional $24 million against the products order, which HP
India deposited in March 2013. The Customs Tribunal did not order any additional deposit to be made under
the parts order. In December 2013, HP India filed applications before the Customs Tribunal seeking early
hearing of the appeals as well as an extension of the stay of deposit as to HP India and the individuals already
granted until final disposition of the appeals. On February 7, 2014, the application for extension of the stay of
deposit was granted by the Customs Tribunal until disposal of the appeals. On October 27, 2014, the Customs
Tribunal commenced hearings on the cross-appeals of the Commissioner’s orders. The Customs Tribunal
rejected HP India’s request to remand the matter to the Commissioner on procedural grounds. The hearings

were scheduled to reconvene on April 6, 2015, and again on November 3, 2015 and April 11, 2016, but were
canceled at the request of the Customs Tribunal. No new hearing date has been set.

Department of Justice, Securities and Exchange Commission Proceedings.

In April 2014, HP Inc. and

HP Inc. subsidiaries in Russia, Poland, and Mexico collectively entered into agreements with the U.S.
Department of Justice (‘‘DOJ’’) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (‘‘SEC’’) to resolve claims of
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (‘‘FCPA’’) violations. Pursuant to the terms of the resolutions with the DOJ and
SEC, HP Inc. was required to undertake certain compliance, reporting and cooperation obligations for a three
year period. In October of 2015, Hewlett Packard Enterprise contractually undertook the same compliance,
reporting and cooperation obligations that were held by HP Inc. under the DOJ resolutions for the balance of
the three year period. Hewlett Packard Enterprise has reached a similar agreement with the Staff of the SEC,
which is set forth in an amended SEC administrative order dated July 15, 2016. Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s
obligations to the SEC expired in April 2017. Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s obligations to the DOJ ran for three
years following a court proceeding held in connection with the resolution, and were satisfied in
September 2017.

ECT Proceedings.

In January 2011, the postal service of Brazil, Empresa Brasileira de Correios e

Tel ´egrafos (‘‘ECT’’), notified a former subsidiary of HP Inc. in Brazil (‘‘HP Brazil’’) that it had initiated
administrative proceedings to consider whether to suspend HP Brazil’s right to bid and contract with ECT
related to alleged improprieties in the bidding and contracting processes whereby employees of HP Brazil and
employees of several other companies allegedly coordinated their bids and fixed results for three ECT
contracts in 2007 and 2008. In late July 2011, ECT notified HP Brazil it had decided to apply the penalties
against HP Brazil and suspend HP Brazil’s right to bid and contract with ECT for five years, based upon the
evidence before it. In August 2011, HP Brazil appealed ECT’s decision. In April 2013, ECT rejected HP Brazil’s
appeal, and the administrative proceedings were closed with the penalties against HP Brazil remaining in place.
In parallel, in September 2011, HP Brazil filed a civil action against ECT seeking to have ECT’s decision
revoked. HP Brazil also requested an injunction suspending the application of the penalties until a final ruling
on the merits of the case. The court of first instance has not issued a decision on the merits of the case, but it
has denied HP Brazil’s request for injunctive relief. HP Brazil appealed the denial of its request for injunctive
relief to the intermediate appellate court, which issued a preliminary ruling denying the request for injunctive
relief but reducing the length of the sanctions from five to two years. HP Brazil appealed that decision and, in
December 2011, obtained a ruling staying enforcement of ECT’s sanctions until a final ruling on the merits of
the case. HP Brazil expects the decision to be issued in 2018 and any subsequent appeal on the merits to last
several years.

Forsyth, et al. vs. HP Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise: This purported class and collective action

was filed on August 18, 2016 and an amended complaint was filed on December 19, 2016 in the United States
District Court for the Northern District of California, against HP Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise alleging
defendants violated the Federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act (‘‘ADEA’’), the California Fair
Employment and Housing Act, California public policy and the California Business and Professions Code by
terminating older workers and replacing them with younger workers. Plaintiffs seek to certify a nationwide
collective action under the ADEA comprised of all individuals aged 40 and older who had their employment
terminated by an HP entity pursuant to a work force reduction (‘‘WFR’’) plan on or after December 9, 2014 for
individuals terminated in deferral states and on or after April 8, 2015 in non-deferral states. Plaintiffs also seek
to certify a Rule 23 class under California law comprised of all persons 40 years or older employed by
defendants in the state of California and terminated pursuant to a WFR plan on or after August 18, 2012. On
September 20, 2017, the court granted the defendants’ motion to compel arbitration and administratively closed
the case pending resolution of the arbitration proceedings. The court held that an arbitrator must first decide
whether the release provisions contained in the relevant arbitration agreements are enforceable. On
October 18, 2017, plaintiffs moved for reconsideration of the court’s order.

Note 19: Litigation and Contingencies (Continued)

Jackson, et al. v. HP Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise: This putative nationwide class action was
filed on July 24, 2017 in federal district court in San Jose. Plaintiffs purport to bring the lawsuit on behalf of
themselves and other similarly situated African-Americans and individuals over the age of forty. Plaintiffs allege
that defendants engaged in a pattern and practice of racial and age discrimination in lay-offs and promotions.
Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on September 29, 2017.

Wall v. Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company and HP Inc. This certified California class action and

Private Attorney General Act action was filed against Hewlett-Packard Company on January 17, 2012 and the
fifth amended (and operative) complaint was filed against HP Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise on June 28,
2016. The complaint alleges that the defendants paid earned incentive compensation late and failed to timely
pay final wages in violation of the California Labor Code. On August 9, 2016, the court ordered the class
certified without prejudice to a future motion to amend or modify the class certification order or to decertify.
Trial is set to begin on January 22, 2018.

Hewlett-Packard Company v. Oracle (Itanium): On June 15, 2011, HP Inc. filed suit against Oracle in
Santa Clara Superior Court in connection with Oracle’s March 2011 announcement that it was discontinuing
software support for HP Inc.’s Itanium-based line of mission critical servers. HP Inc. asserted, among other
things, that Oracle’s actions breached the contract that was signed by the parties as part of the settlement of
the litigation relating to Oracle’s hiring of Mark Hurd. The matter eventually progressed to trial, which was
bifurcated into two phases. HP Inc. prevailed in the first phase of the trial, in which the court ruled that the
contract at issue required Oracle to continue to offer its software products on HP Inc.’s Itanium-based servers
for as long as HP Inc. decided to sell such servers. Phase 2 of the trial was then postponed by Oracle’s appeal
of the trial court’s denial of Oracle’s ‘‘anti-SLAPP’’ motion, in which Oracle argued that HP Inc.’s damages
claim infringed on Oracle’s First Amendment rights. On August 27, 2015, the Court of Appeal rejected Oracle’s
appeal. The matter was remanded to the trial court for Phase 2 of the trial, which began on May 23, 2016, and
was submitted to the jury on June 29, 2016. On June 30, 2016, the jury returned a verdict in favor of HP Inc.,
awarding HP Inc. approximately $3 billion in damages: $1.7 billion for past lost profits and $1.3 billion for future
lost profits. On October 20, 2016, the court entered judgment for this amount with interest accruing until the
judgment is paid. Oracle’s motion for a new trial was denied on December 19, 2016, and Oracle filed its notice
of appeal from the trial court’s judgment on January 17, 2017. On February 2, 2017, HP Inc. filed a notice of
cross-appeal challenging the trial court’s denial of prejudgment interest. The schedule for appellate briefing and
argument has not yet been established. HP Inc. expects that the appeals process could take several years to
complete. Pursuant to the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, HP Inc. and Hewlett Packard
Enterprise will share equally in any recovery from Oracle once Hewlett Packard Enterprise has been
reimbursed for all costs incurred in the prosecution of the action prior to the HP Inc./Hewlett Packard Enterprise
separation on November 1, 2015.

Network-1 Technologies, Inc. v. Alcatel-Lucent USA Inc., et al. This patent infringement action was filed
in September 2011 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas and alleges that various
Hewlett Packard Enterprise switches and access points infringe Network-1’s patent relating to the 802.3af and
802.3at ‘‘Power over Ethernet’’ standards. The Network-1 patent at issue expires in 2020. A jury trial was
conducted beginning on November 6, 2017. On November 13, 2017, the jury returned a verdict in favor of
HPE, finding that HPE did not infringe Network-1’s patent and that the patent was invalid. The Company
expects Network-1 to appeal following post-trial motion practice and the entry of judgment.

Environmental

The Company’s operations and products are or may in the future become subject to various federal,

state, local and foreign laws and regulations concerning environmental protection, including laws addressing
the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and
wastes, the clean-up of contaminated sites, the substances and materials used in the Company’s products, the
energy consumption of products, services and operations and the operational or financial responsibility for

recycling, treatment and disposal of those products. This includes legislation that makes producers of electrical
goods, including servers and networking equipment, financially responsible for specified collection, recycling,
treatment and disposal of past and future covered products (sometimes referred to as ‘‘product take-back
legislation’’). The Company could incur substantial costs, its products could be restricted from entering certain
jurisdictions, and it could face other sanctions, if it were to violate or become liable under environmental laws
or if its products become non-compliant with environmental laws. The Company’s potential exposure includes
impacts on revenue, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, third-party property damage or personal injury claims
and clean-up costs. The amount and timing of costs to comply with environmental laws are difficult to predict.

In particular, the Company may become a party to, or otherwise involved in, proceedings brought by

U.S. or state environmental agencies under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act (‘‘CERCLA’’), known as ‘‘Superfund,’’ or other federal, state or foreign laws and regulations
addressing the clean-up of contaminated sites, and may become a party to, or otherwise involved in,
proceedings brought by private parties for contribution towards clean-up costs. The Company is also
contractually obligated to make financial contributions to address actions related to certain environmental
liabilities, both ongoing and arising in the future, pursuant to its Separation and Distribution Agreement with
HP Inc.

Other Contingencies

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company’s facilities in Houston, Texas sustained significant

damage as a result of Hurricane Harvey. For fiscal 2017, the Company recorded $52 million in Disaster
charges in its Consolidated Statement of Earnings, which primarily represents the deductible under the
Company’s insurance plans. The Company continues to evaluate the impact of Hurricane Harvey on the
business and has filed a claim under its insurance program for property damage and incremental expenses.
However, as of October 31, 2017, the final claim amount was not quantified, and as such, no insurance
receivable was recorded.

As a result of the damage caused by Hurricane Harvey, the Company further recognized an asset

impairment charge of $41 million for the buildings it owns in Houston, Texas. The impairment charge
represented the difference between the carrying value of the buildings and estimated market value.

Note 20: Guarantees, Indemnifications and Warranties

Guarantees

In the ordinary course of business, the Company may issue performance guarantees to certain of its

clients, customers and other parties pursuant to which the Company has guaranteed the performance
obligations of third parties. Some of those guarantees may be backed by standby letters of credit or surety
bonds. In general, the Company would be obligated to perform over the term of the guarantee in the event a
specified triggering event occurs as defined by the guarantee. The Company believes the likelihood of having
to perform under a material guarantee is remote.

The Company has entered into service contracts with certain of its clients that are supported by financing

arrangements. With the completion of the Everett Transaction, these service contracts now primarily relate to
TS contracts. If a service contract is terminated as a result of the Company’s non-performance under the
contract or failure to comply with the terms of the financing arrangement, the Company could, under certain
circumstances, be required to acquire certain assets related to the service contract. The Company believes the
likelihood of having to acquire a material amount of assets under these arrangements is remote.

Note 20: Guarantees, Indemnifications and Warranties (Continued)

Indemnifications

In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into contractual arrangements under which the
Company may agree to indemnify a third party to such arrangement from any losses incurred relating to the
services they perform on behalf of the Company or for losses arising from certain events as defined within the
particular contract, which may include, for example, litigation or claims relating to past performance. The
Company also provides indemnifications to certain vendors and customers against claims of IP infringement
made by third parties arising from the use by such vendors and customers of the Company’s software products
and support services and certain other matters. Some indemnifications may not be subject to maximum loss
clauses. Historically, payments made related to these indemnifications have been immaterial.

General Cross-indemnification

In connection with the Separation, the Company entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement

with HP Inc. effective November 1, 2015 where the Company agreed to indemnify HP Inc., each of its
subsidiaries and each of their respective directors, officers and employees from and against all liabilities
relating to, arising out of or resulting from, among other matters, the liabilities allocated to the Company as part
of the Separation. HP Inc. similarly agreed to indemnify the Company, each of its subsidiaries and each of their
respective directors, officers and employees from and against all claims and liabilities relating to, arising out of
or resulting from, among other matters, the liabilities allocated to HP Inc. as part of the Separation. As a result,
as of October 31, 2017 and October 31, 2016 the Company has recorded both a receivable from HP Inc. of
$48 million and $56 million, respectively, and a payable to HP Inc. of $41 million and $41 million, respectively,
related to litigation matters and other contingencies.

In connection with the Everett Transaction, the Company entered into a Separation and Distribution

Agreement with DXC, effective April 1, 2017, where DXC agreed to indemnify HPE, each of its subsidiaries
and each of their respective directors, officers and employees from and against all liabilities relating to, arising
out of or resulting from, among other matters, the liabilities allocated to DXC as part of the Everett Transaction.
HPE similarly agreed to indemnify DXC, each of its subsidiaries and each of their respective directors, officers
and employees from and against all claims and liabilities relating to, arising out of or resulting from, among
other matters, the liabilities allocated to the Company as part of the Everett Transaction. As a result, as of
October 31, 2017, the Company has recorded both a receivable from DXC of $87 million and a payable to
DXC of $27 million related to litigation matters and other contingencies.

In connection with the Seattle Transaction, the Company entered into a Separation and Distribution

Agreement with Micro Focus, effective September 1, 2017, where Micro Focus agreed to indemnify HPE, each
of its subsidiaries and each of their respective directors, officers and employees from and against all liabilities
relating to, arising out of or resulting from, among other matters, the liabilities allocated to Micro Focus as part
of the Seattle Transaction. HPE similarly agreed to indemnify Micro Focus, each of its subsidiaries and each of
their respective directors, officers and employees from and against all claims and liabilities relating to, arising
out of or resulting from, among other matters, the liabilities allocated to the Company as part of the Seattle
Transaction. As a result, as of October 31, 2017, the Company has recorded both a receivable from Micro
Focus of $14 million and a payable to Micro Focus of $24 million related to litigation matters and other
contingencies.

Shared Litigation with HP Inc., DXC and Micro Focus

As part of the Separation and Distribution Agreements between Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc.,
Hewlett Packard Enterprise and DXC, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Seattle SpinCo, the parties to each
agreement agreed to cooperate with each other in managing certain existing litigation related to both parties’
businesses. The Separation and Distribution Agreements also included provisions that assign to the parties
responsibility for managing pending and future litigation related to the general corporate matters of HP Inc. (in
the case of the separation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise from HP Inc.) or of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (in the

case of the separation of DXC from Hewlett Packard Enterprise and the separation of Seattle SpinCo from
Hewlett Packard Enterprise), in each case arising prior to the applicable separation.

Tax Matters Agreement with HPI and Other Income Tax Matters

In connection with the Separation, the Company entered into a Tax Matters Agreement (the ‘‘Tax Matters
Agreement’’) with HP Inc. effective November 1, 2015 that governs the rights and obligations of the Company
and HP Inc. for certain pre-Separation tax liabilities. The Tax Matters Agreement provides that the Company
and HP Inc. will share certain pre-Separation income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax
authorities to the Company and HP Inc.’s U.S. and certain non-U.S. income tax returns. In certain jurisdictions,
the Company and HP Inc. have joint and several liability for past income tax liabilities and accordingly, the
Company could be legally liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities and required to make additional tax
payments. In these cases, the Company records the entire liability, which is partially offset by the
indemnification receivable from HP Inc., thereby reflecting the Company’s net exposure in its Consolidated
Balance Sheets.

In addition, if the Distribution of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s common shares to the HP Inc. stockholders

are determined to be taxable, the Company and HP Inc. would share the tax liability equally, unless the
taxability of the Distribution is the direct result of action taken by either the Company or HP Inc. subsequent to
the Distribution in which case the party causing the Distribution to be taxable would be responsible for any
taxes imposed on the Distribution.

As of October 31, 2017, the Company recorded a net long-term receivable of $1.3 billion from HP Inc. for
certain tax liabilities that the Company is joint and severally liable for, but for which it is indemnified by HP Inc.
under the Tax Matters Agreement. The actual amount that the Company may receive could vary depending
upon the outcome of certain unresolved tax matters, which may not be resolved for several years.

Tax Matters Agreement with DXC and Other Income Tax Matters

In connection with the Everett Transaction, the Company entered into a Tax Matters Agreement (the

‘‘DXC Tax Matters Agreement’’) with DXC effective on April 1, 2017 that governs the rights and obligations of
the Company and DXC for certain pre-divestiture tax liabilities and tax receivables. The DXC Tax Matters
Agreement generally provides that the Company will be responsible for pre-divestiture tax liabilities and will be
entitled to pre-divestiture tax receivables that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to the Company
and DXC’s U.S. and certain non-U.S. tax returns. In certain jurisdictions the Company and DXC have joint and
several liability for past tax liabilities and accordingly, the Company could be legally liable under applicable tax
law for such liabilities and required to make additional tax payments.

In addition, if the distribution of Everett’s common shares to Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s stockholders is

determined to be taxable, the Company would generally bear the tax liability, unless the taxability of the
distribution is the direct result of actions taken by DXC, in which case DXC would be responsible for any taxes
imposed on the distribution.

As of October 31, 2017, the Company recorded a net tax indemnification receivable of $109 million from

DXC for certain tax liabilities and tax receivables. The actual amount that DXC may be obligated to pay the
Company could vary depending upon the outcome of certain unresolved tax matters, which may not be
resolved for several years.

Tax Matters Agreement with Seattle and Other Income Tax Matters

In connection with the Seattle Transaction, the Company entered into a Tax Matters Agreement (the
‘‘Micro Focus Tax Matters Agreement’’) with Micro Focus effective on September 1, 2017 that governs the

rights and obligations of the Company and Micro Focus for certain pre-divestiture tax liabilities and tax
receivables. The Micro Focus Tax Matters Agreement generally provides that the Company will be responsible
for pre-divestiture tax liabilities and will be entitled to pre-divestiture tax receivables that arise from adjustments
made by tax authorities to the Company and Micro Focus’s U.S. and certain non-U.S. tax returns. In certain
jurisdictions the Company and Micro Focus have joint and several liability for past tax liabilities and accordingly,
the Company could be legally liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities and required to make additional
tax payments.

In addition, if the distribution of Seattle’s common shares to Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s stockholders is

determined to be taxable, the Company would generally bear the tax liability, unless the taxability of the
distribution is the direct result of actions taken by Micro Focus, in which case Micro Focus would be
responsible for any taxes imposed on the distribution.

As of October 31, 2017, the Company recorded a net tax indemnification payable of $31 million to Micro
Focus for certain tax liabilities and tax receivables. The actual amount that the Company may be obligated to
pay Micro Focus could vary depending upon the outcome of certain unresolved tax matters, which may not be
resolved for several years.

Warranties

The Company accrues the estimated cost of product warranties at the time it recognizes revenue. The

Company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and
evaluating the quality of its component suppliers; however, contractual warranty terms, repair costs, product call
rates, average cost per call, current period product shipments and ongoing product failure rates, as well as
specific product class failures outside of the Company’s baseline experience, affect the estimated warranty
obligation.

The Company’s aggregate product warranty liabilities and changes therein were as follows:

Note 22: Equity Method Investments

The Company includes investments which are accounted for using the equity method, under Investments

in equity interests on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of October 31, 2017 and October 31,
2016, the Company’s Investments in equity interests were $2.5 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively, primarily
related to a 49% equity interest in H3C.

Investment in H3C

In May 2016, Tsinghua Holdings’ subsidiary, Unisplendour Corporation, purchased 51% of a new

business named H3C, which is comprised of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s former H3C Technologies and
China-based servers, storage and technology services businesses which were previously reported within the

Note 22: Equity Method Investments (Continued)

EG segment. The Company retained a 49% interest in the new company, which it records as an equity method
investment.

In the periods presented, the Company recorded its interest in the net earnings of H3C along with an

adjustment to eliminate unrealized profits on intra-entity sales, and the amortization of basis difference, within
Loss from equity interests in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Earnings.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company received a cash dividend of $98 million from H3C.
This amount was accounted for as a return on investment and reflected as a reduction in the carrying balance
of the Company’s Investments in equity interests in its Consolidated Balance Sheet.

The difference between the sale date carrying value of the Company’s investment in H3C and its

proportionate share of the net assets of H3C, created a basis difference of $2.5 billion, which was allocated as
follows:

The Company amortizes the basis difference over the estimated useful lives of the assets that gave rise

to this difference. The weighted-average life of the H3C intangible assets is five years and will be amortized
using a straight-line method. IPR&D is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite
life and assessed for impairment thereafter. When the IPR&D project is complete, it is reclassified as an
amortizable purchased intangible asset and is amortized over its estimated useful life. If an IPR&D project is
abandoned, the Company will record the full basis difference charge for the value of the related intangible
asset to its Consolidated and Combined Statements of Earnings in the period of abandonment. Equity method
goodwill is not amortized or tested for impairment; instead the equity method investment is tested for
impairment whenever factors indicate that the carrying value of the investment may not be recoverable. As of
October 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company determined that no impairment of its equity method investments
existed.

The Company recorded a Loss from equity interests of $23 million and $76 million during fiscal 2017 and
2016 respectively, in the Consolidated and Combined Statement of Earnings. For fiscal 2017, Loss from equity
interests consists of basis difference amortization of $155 million, partially offset by the Company’s share of
H3C’s net income of $127 million and an adjustment related to elimination of profit on intra-entity sales and
withholding taxes of $5 million. For fiscal 2016, Loss from equity interests consists of basis difference
amortization of $93 million and adjustment related to elimination of profit on intra-entity sales of $15 million,
partially offset by the Company’s share of H3C’s net income of $32 million. This loss was reflected as a
reduction in the carrying amount of Investments in equity interests in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of
October 31, 2017 and 2016.

The Company also has commercial arrangements with H3C to buy and sell HPE branded servers,
storage, networking and technology services. During fiscal 2017 and 2016, HPE recorded approximately
$1.2 billion and $0.5 billion in sales to H3C and $331 million and $169 million in purchases from H3C,
respectively. Net payables due to H3C as of October 31, 2017 and 2016 were approximately $64 million and
$71 million, respectively.
