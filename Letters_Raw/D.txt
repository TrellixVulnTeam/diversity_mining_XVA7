Dear Fellow Shareholders:

The D.R. Horton team delivered an outstanding year in fiscal 2017. We closed 58% more homes than any 

other homebuilder, completing our 16th consecutive year as the largest homebuilder in the United States. Our 
experienced operational teams, broad geographic base, product diversity and financial strength provide a strong 
competitive position to achieve growth in both revenues and profits while improving our return on inventory and 
generating positive annual cash flow from operations.

Our financial achievements during fiscal 2017 included the following:

Increased total revenues by 16%;

Increased consolidated pre-tax income by 18% to $1.6 billion;

Improved consolidated pre-tax profit margin by 30 basis points to 11.4%;

by 120 basis points to 16.6%;

Generated $435.1 million of cash from operations;

Improved homebuilding debt to total capital by 520 basis points to 24.0%;

Increased total equity to $7.7 billion, up 14% from $6.8 billion a year ago; and

Increased book value per share to $20.66, up 13% from a year ago.

The key to our performance is a consistent focus on the fundamentals of our business in each of our 

communities across the 79 markets in which we operate. Our operational teams in each market are responsible for

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

D.R. Horton, Inc. is the largest homebuilding company in the United States as measured by number of homes 

closed and revenues. We construct and sell homes through our operating divisions in 79 markets in 26 states, under the 
names of D.R. Horton, America’s Builder, Emerald Homes, Express Homes, Freedom Homes and Pacific Ridge Homes. 
Our common stock is included in the S&P 500 Index and listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker 
symbol “DHI.” Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms “D.R. Horton,” the “Company,” “we” and “our” used 
herein refer to D.R. Horton, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its predecessors and subsidiaries.

Our homebuilding business began in 1978 in Fort Worth, Texas, and our common stock has been publicly traded 
since 1992. We have expanded and diversified our homebuilding operations geographically over the years by investing 
available capital into our existing markets, start-up operations in new markets and acquisitions of other homebuilding 
companies. Our product offerings across our operating markets are broad and diverse. Our homes range in size from 
1,000 to more than 4,000 square feet and in price from $100,000 to more than $1,000,000. For the year ended 
September 30, 2017, we closed 45,751 homes with an average closing price of $298,400.

Our business operations consist of homebuilding, financial services and other activities. Our homebuilding 

operations are the most substantial part of our business, comprising 98% of consolidated revenues, which totaled $14.1 
billion in fiscal 2017. Our homebuilding operations generate most of their revenues from the sale of completed homes, 
with a lesser amount from the sale of land and lots. Approximately 88% of our home sales revenue in fiscal 2017 was 
generated from the sale of single-family detached homes, with the remainder from the sale of attached homes, such as 
townhomes, duplexes, triplexes and condominiums.

Our financial services operations provide mortgage financing and title agency services to homebuyers in many of 
our homebuilding markets. DHI Mortgage, our 100% owned subsidiary, provides mortgage financing services primarily 
to our homebuyers and generally sells the mortgages it originates and the related servicing rights to third-party 
purchasers. DHI Mortgage originates loans in accordance with purchaser guidelines and sells substantially all of its 
mortgage production shortly after origination. Our subsidiary title companies serve as title insurance agents by providing 
title insurance policies, examination and closing services, primarily to our homebuyers.

In addition to our core homebuilding and financial services operations, we have subsidiaries that engage in other 
business activities. These subsidiaries conduct insurance-related operations, construct and own income-producing rental 
properties, own non-residential real estate including ranch land and improvements and own and operate oil and gas 
related assets. The operating results of these subsidiaries are immaterial for separate reporting and therefore are grouped 
together and presented as other. One of these subsidiaries, DHI Communities, recently began developing and 
constructing multi-family rental properties on land parcels we already owned and currently has four projects under active 
construction. Costs incurred by DHI Communities totaled $93.7 million at September 30, 2017 and are included in 
property and equipment in the Financial Services and Other section of our consolidated balance sheet. The combined 
assets of all of our subsidiaries engaged in other business activities totaled $143.3 million and $54.9 million at 
September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and the combined pre-tax loss of these subsidiaries was $11.7 million, $9.0 
million and $0 in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

OPERATING STRUCTURE AND PROCESSES

Following is an overview of our company’s operating structure and the significant processes that support our 

business controls, strategies and performance.

Homebuilding Markets

Our homebuilding business began in the Dallas/Fort Worth area, which is still one of our largest homebuilding 

operations and home to our corporate headquarters. We currently operate in 26 states and 79 markets, which provides us 
with geographic diversification in our homebuilding inventory investments and our sources of revenues and earnings. We 
believe our geographic diversification lowers our operational risks by mitigating the effects of local and regional 
economic cycles, and it also enhances our earnings potential by providing more diverse opportunities to invest in our 
business.

2

We conduct our homebuilding operations in the geographic regions, states and markets listed below, and we 

conduct our financial services operations in many of these markets. Our homebuilding operating divisions are aggregated 
into six reporting segments, also referred to as reporting regions, which comprise the markets below. Our financial 
statements and the notes thereto contain additional information regarding segment performance.

When evaluating new or existing homebuilding markets for purposes of capital allocation, we consider local, 

market-specific factors, including among others:

•  Economic conditions;

•  Employment levels and job growth;

• 

Income level of potential homebuyers;

•  Local housing affordability and typical mortgage products utilized;

•  Market for homes at our targeted price points;

•  Availability of land and lots in desirable locations on acceptable terms;

•  Land entitlement and development processes;

•  Availability of qualified subcontractors;

•  New and secondary home sales activity;

•  Competition; and

• 

Prevailing housing products, features, cost and pricing.

Economies of Scale

We are the largest homebuilding company in the United States in fiscal 2017 as measured by number of homes 

closed and revenues, and we are also one of the largest builders in many of the markets in which we operate. We believe 
that our national, regional and local scale of operations provides us with benefits that may not be available to the same 
degree to some other smaller homebuilders, such as:

•  Greater access to and lower cost of capital, due to our balance sheet strength and our lending and capital 

markets relationships;

•  Volume discounts and rebates from national, regional and local materials suppliers and lower labor rates from 

certain subcontractors; and

•  Enhanced leverage of our general and administrative activities, which allows us flexibility to adjust to 

changes in market conditions and compete effectively in each of our markets.

Decentralized Homebuilding Operations

We view homebuilding as a local business; therefore, most of our direct homebuilding activities are decentralized 
to provide flexibility to our local managers on operational decisions. We believe that our local management teams, who 
are familiar with local conditions, have the best information to make many decisions regarding their operations. At 
September 30, 2017, we had 41 separate homebuilding operating divisions, many of which operate in more than one 
market area. Generally, each operating division consists of a division president; a controller; land entitlement, acquisition 
and development personnel; a sales manager and sales and marketing personnel; a construction manager and 
construction superintendents; customer service personnel; a purchasing manager and office staff. Our division presidents 
receive performance-based compensation if they achieve targeted financial and operating metrics related to their 
operating divisions. Following is a summary of our homebuilding activities that are decentralized in our local operating 
divisions, and the control and oversight functions that are centralized in our regional and corporate offices.

4

Operating Division Responsibilities

Each operating division is responsible for:

• 

Site selection, which involves

— A feasibility study;

— Soil and environmental reviews;

— Review of existing zoning and other governmental requirements;

— Review of the need for and extent of offsite work required to obtain project entitlements; and

— Financial analysis of the potential project;

•  Negotiating lot option, land acquisition and related contracts;

•  Obtaining all necessary land development and home construction approvals;

• 

• 

• 

• 

Selecting land development subcontractors and ensuring their work meets our contracted scopes;

Selecting building and architectural plans;

Selecting construction subcontractors and ensuring their work meets our contracted scopes;

Planning and managing home construction schedules;

•  Determining the pricing for each house plan and options in a given community;

•  Developing and implementing local marketing and sales plans;

•  Coordinating all interactions with customers and real estate brokers during the sales, construction and home 

closing processes; and 

•  Ensuring the quality and timeliness of post-closing service and warranty repairs provided to customers.

Centralized Controls

We centralize many important risk elements of our homebuilding business through our regional and corporate 

offices. We have five separate homebuilding regional offices. Generally, each regional office consists of a region 
president, a chief financial officer, legal counsel and other operational and office support staff. Each of our region 
presidents and their management teams are responsible for oversight of the operations of a number of homebuilding 
operating divisions, including:

•  Review and approval of division business plans and budgets;

•  Review and approval of all land and lot acquisition contracts;

•  Review of all business and financial analysis for potential land and lot inventory investments;

•  Oversight of land and home inventory levels;

•  Monitoring division financial and operating performance; and

•  Review of major personnel decisions and division incentive compensation plans.

5

Our corporate executives and corporate office departments are responsible for establishing our operational policies 

and internal control standards and for monitoring compliance with established policies and controls throughout our 
operations. The corporate office also has primary responsibility for direct management of certain key risk elements and 
initiatives through the following centralized functions:

• 

Financing;

•  Cash management;

•  Allocation of capital;

• 

Issuance and monitoring of inventory investment guidelines;

•  Approval and funding of land and lot acquisitions;

•  Monitoring and analysis of profitability, returns, costs and inventory levels;

•  Risk and litigation management;

•  Environmental assessments of land and lot acquisitions;

•  Technology systems to support management of operations, marketing and information;

•  Accounting and management reporting;

• 

• 

• 

Income taxes;

Internal audit;

Public reporting and investor and media relations;

•  Administration of payroll and employee benefits;

•  Negotiation of national purchasing contracts;

•  Administration, reporting and monitoring of customer satisfaction surveys and resolutions of issues; and

•  Approval of major personnel decisions and management incentive compensation plans.

Land/Lot Acquisition and Inventory Management

We acquire land for use in our homebuilding operations after we have completed due diligence and generally after 

we have obtained the rights (known as entitlements) to begin development or construction work resulting in an 
acceptable number of residential lots. Before we acquire lots or tracts of land, we complete a feasibility study, which 
includes soil tests, independent environmental studies, other engineering work and financial analysis. We also evaluate 
the status of necessary zoning and other governmental entitlements required to develop and use the property for home 
construction. Although we purchase and develop land primarily to support our homebuilding activities, we may sell land 
and lots to other developers and homebuilders where we have excess land and lot positions or for other strategic reasons.

We also enter into land/lot option contracts, in which we obtain the right, but generally not the obligation, to buy 

land or lots at predetermined prices on a defined schedule commensurate with anticipated home closings or planned 
development. Our option contracts generally are non-recourse, which limits our financial exposure to our earnest money 
deposited into escrow under the terms of the contract and any pre-acquisition due diligence costs we incur. This enables 
us to control land and lot positions with limited capital investment, which substantially reduces the risks associated with 
land ownership and development.

6

We directly acquire almost all of our land and lot positions. We are a party to a small number of joint ventures, all 

of which are consolidated in our financial statements.

We attempt to mitigate our exposure to real estate inventory risks by:

•  Managing our supply of land/lots controlled (owned and optioned) in each market based on anticipated future 

home closing levels;

•  Monitoring local market and demographic trends, housing preferences and related economic developments, 
including the identification of desirable housing submarkets based on the quality of local schools, new job 
opportunities, local growth initiatives and personal income trends;

•  Utilizing land/lot option contracts, where possible;

• 

Seeking to acquire developed lots which are substantially ready for home construction, where possible;

•  Controlling our levels of investment in land acquisition, land development and housing inventory to match 

the expected housing demand in each of our operating markets; and

•  Monitoring and managing the number of speculative homes (homes under construction without an executed 

sales contract) built in each subdivision.

Land Development and Home Construction

Substantially all of our land development and home construction work is performed by subcontractors. 

Subcontractors typically are selected after a competitive bidding process and are retained for a specific subdivision or 
series of house plans pursuant to a contract that obligates the subcontractor to complete the scope of work at an agreed-
upon price. We employ land development managers and construction superintendents to monitor land development and 
home construction activities, participate in major design and building decisions, coordinate the activities of 
subcontractors and suppliers, review the work of subcontractors for quality and cost controls and monitor compliance 
with zoning and building codes. In addition, our construction superintendents interact with our homebuyers during the 
construction process and instruct buyers on post-closing home maintenance.

Our home designs are selected or prepared in each of our markets to appeal to the preferences of local homebuyers 

in each community. Our local management teams regularly adjust our product offerings to address our customers’ 
expectations for affordability, home size and features. In many communities, we offer optional interior and exterior 
features to homebuyers for an additional charge. Construction time for our homes depends on the availability of labor, 
materials and supplies, the weather, the size of the home and other factors. We complete the construction of most homes 
within two to six months.

We typically do not maintain significant inventories of land development or construction materials, except for 

work in progress materials for active development projects and homes under construction. Generally, the construction 
materials used in our operations are readily available from numerous sources. We have contracts exceeding one year with 
certain suppliers of building materials that are cancelable at our option.

We are subject to governmental regulations that affect our land development and construction operations. At times, 

we have experienced delays in receiving the proper approvals from municipalities or other government agencies that 
have delayed our anticipated development and construction activities in certain communities. 

7

Cost Controls

We control construction costs by designing our homes efficiently and by obtaining competitive bids for 

construction materials and labor. We also competitively bid and negotiate pricing from our subcontractors and suppliers 
based on the volume of services and products we purchase on a local, regional and national basis. We monitor our land 
development expenditures and construction costs versus budgets for each house and community, and we review our 
inventory levels, margins, expenses, profitability and returns for each operating market compared to both its business 
plan and our performance expectations.

We control overhead costs by centralizing certain accounting and administrative functions and by monitoring 

staffing and compensation levels. We review other general and administrative costs to identify efficiencies and savings 
opportunities in our operating divisions and our regional and corporate offices. We also direct many of our promotional 
activities toward local real estate brokers and digital marketing initiatives, which we believe are efficient uses of our 
marketing expenditures.

Marketing and Sales

We use the D.R. Horton, Emerald Homes, Express Homes and Freedom Homes brand names to market and sell our 

homes. Our D.R. Horton branded communities are the core of our business and account for the majority of our home 
closings, focusing on the first time and first time move-up homebuyer. Our Emerald branded communities appeal to 
buyers in search of higher-end move-up and luxury homes. Our Express branded communities primarily accommodate a 
segment of entry-level buyers who are focused on affordability. We introduced our Freedom Homes brand in late fiscal 
2016 to offer affordable homes to active adult buyers seeking a low-maintenance lifestyle. The percentage of home 
closings and home sales revenue contributed by each brand during fiscal 2017 was as follows:

We also use the Pacific Ridge Homes brand in our Seattle market following our acquisition of their homebuilding 

operations in fiscal 2015, and their product offerings are similar to, and included with, our D.R. Horton branded 
communities shown above.

We market and sell our homes primarily through commissioned employees, and the majority of our home closings 

also involve an independent real estate broker. We typically conduct home sales from sales offices located in furnished 
model homes in each subdivision, and we generally do not offer our model homes for sale until the completion of a 
subdivision. Our sales personnel assist prospective homebuyers by providing floor plans and price information, 
demonstrating the features and layouts of our homes and assisting with the selection of options, when available. We train 
and inform our sales personnel as to the availability of financing, construction schedules and marketing and advertising 
plans. As market conditions warrant, we may provide potential homebuyers with incentives, such as discounts or free 
upgrades, to be competitive in a particular market or to attain our targeted sales pace.

We market our homes and communities to prospective homebuyers and real estate brokers digitally, through email, 
search engine marketing, social media and our company website and other real estate websites, in addition to print media 
and advertisement. We also use billboards, radio, television, magazine and newspaper advertising locally as necessary. 
We attempt to position our subdivisions in locations that are desirable to potential homebuyers and convenient to or 
visible from local traffic patterns, which helps to reduce advertising costs. Model homes play an important role in our 
marketing efforts, and we expend significant effort and resources to create an attractive atmosphere in our model homes.

8

We also build speculative homes in most of our communities, which allow us to compete effectively with existing 
homes available in the market and improve our profits and returns. These homes enhance our marketing and sales efforts 
to prospective homebuyers who are renters or who are relocating to these markets and require a home within a short time 
frame, as well as to independent brokers who represent these homebuyers. We determine our speculative homes strategy 
in each market based on local market factors, such as new job growth, the number of job relocations, housing demand 
and supply, seasonality, current sales contract cancellation trends and our past experience in the market. We maintain a 
level of speculative home inventory in each community based on our current and planned sales pace, and we monitor and 
adjust speculative home inventory on an ongoing basis as conditions warrant.

Sales Contracts and Backlog

Our sales contracts require an earnest money deposit which varies in amount across our markets and communities. 
Additionally, customers are generally required to pay additional deposits when they select options or upgrade features for 
their homes. Our sales contracts include a financing contingency which permits customers to cancel and receive a refund 
of their deposit if they cannot obtain mortgage financing at prevailing or specified interest rates within a specified period. 
Our contracts may include other contingencies, such as the sale of an existing home. We either retain or refund customer 
deposits on cancelled sales contracts, depending upon the applicable provisions of the contract or other circumstances.

Sales order backlog represents homes under contract but not yet closed at the end of the period. At September 30, 

2017, the value of our backlog of sales orders was $3.7 billion (12,329 homes), an increase of 8% from $3.4 billion 
(11,475 homes) at September 30, 2016. The average sales price of homes in backlog was $302,200 at September 30, 
2017, up 1% from the $299,600 average at September 30, 2016. Many of the contracts in our sales order backlog are 
subject to contingencies, such as those described above, which can result in cancellations. A portion of the contracts in 
backlog will not result in closings due to cancellations. As a percentage of gross sales orders, cancellations of sales 
contracts were 22% and 23% in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively.

The length of time between the signing of a sales contract for a home and delivery of the home to the buyer 

(closing) is generally from two to six months; therefore, substantially all of the homes in our sales backlog at 
September 30, 2017 are scheduled to close in fiscal year 2018.

Customer Service and Quality Control

Our operating divisions are responsible for pre-closing quality control inspections and responding to customers’ 

post-closing needs. We believe that a prompt and courteous response to homebuyers’ needs during and after construction 
reduces post-closing repair costs, enhances our reputation for quality and service and ultimately leads to repeat and 
referral business from the real estate community and homebuyers. We typically provide our homebuyers with a ten-year 
limited warranty for major defects in structural elements such as framing components and foundation systems, a two-
year limited warranty on major mechanical systems, and a one-year limited warranty on other construction components. 
The subcontractors who perform the actual construction also provide us with warranties on workmanship and are 
generally prepared to respond to us and the homeowner promptly upon request. In addition, some of our suppliers 
provide manufacturer’s warranties on specified products installed in the home.

Customer Mortgage Financing

We provide mortgage financing services principally to purchasers of our homes in the majority of our 

homebuilding markets through DHI Mortgage, our 100% owned subsidiary. DHI Mortgage assists in the sales 
transaction by coordinating the mortgage application, mortgage commitment and home closing processes to facilitate a 
timely and efficient home buying experience for our buyers. During the year ended September 30, 2017, DHI Mortgage 
provided mortgage financing services for approximately 56% of our total homes closed, and approximately 95% of DHI 
Mortgage’s loan volume related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations. Most of our homebuilding divisions 
also work with a number of additional mortgage lenders that offer a range of mortgage financing programs to our 
homebuyers.

9

To limit the risks associated with our mortgage operations, DHI Mortgage originates loan products that we believe 
can be sold to third-party purchasers of mortgage loans, the majority of which are eligible for sale to the Federal National 
Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) or the Government 
National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae). DHI Mortgage sells substantially all of the loans and their servicing rights 
to third-party purchasers shortly after origination with limited recourse provisions. DHI Mortgage centralizes most of its 
control and oversight functions, including those related to loan underwriting, quality control, regulatory compliance, 
secondary marketing of loans, hedging activities, accounting and financial reporting.

Title Services

Through our subsidiary title companies, we serve as a title insurance agent in selected markets by providing title 

insurance policies, examination and closing services primarily to our homebuilding customers. We currently assume little 
or no underwriting risk associated with these title policies.

Employees

At September 30, 2017, we employed 7,735 persons, of whom 1,673 were sales and marketing personnel, 2,157 

were involved in construction, 2,107 were office personnel and 1,798 worked in mortgage and title operations. We focus 
significant attention toward attracting and retaining talented and experienced individuals to manage and support our 
operations, and we believe that we have good relations with our employees.

Recent Business Acquisitions

We routinely evaluate opportunities to profitably expand our operations, including potential acquisitions of other 
homebuilding or related businesses. Acquisitions of homebuilding businesses usually provide us with immediate land 
and home inventories and control of additional land and lot positions through option contracts. Also, employees of 
acquired businesses generally have specialized knowledge of local market conditions, including existing relationships 
with municipalities, land owners, developers, subcontractors and suppliers. These inventory positions and local market 
knowledge and relationships could take us several years to develop through our own efforts. We seek to limit the risks 
associated with acquiring other companies by conducting extensive operational, financial and legal due diligence on each 
acquisition and by performing financial analysis to determine that each acquisition will have a positive impact on our 
earnings within an acceptable period of time.

In September 2016, we acquired the homebuilding operations of Wilson Parker Homes, which operated in Atlanta 

and Augusta, Georgia; Raleigh, North Carolina; Columbia, South Carolina and Phoenix, Arizona. 

Subsequent to September 30, 2017, we acquired 75% of the outstanding shares of Forestar Group Inc. (Forestar) 

for $558.3 million in cash, pursuant to the terms of the June 2017 merger agreement. Forestar is and will continue to be a 
publicly-traded residential and real estate development company with operations currently in 14 markets and 10 states, 
where it owns, directly or through joint ventures, interests in 44 residential and mixed-use projects. Our alignment with 
Forestar advances our strategy of increasing our access to high-quality optioned land and lot positions to enhance 
operational efficiency and returns. Both companies are identifying land development opportunities to expand Forestar’s 
platform, and we plan to acquire a large portion of Forestar’s finished lots in accordance with the master supply 
agreement between the two companies.

10

Competition

The homebuilding industry is highly competitive. We compete with numerous other national, regional and local 

homebuilders for homebuyers, desirable land, raw materials, skilled labor, employees, management talent and financing. 
We also compete with resales of existing and foreclosed homes and with the rental housing market. Our homes compete 
on the basis of quality, price, location, design and mortgage financing terms.

The competitors to our financial services businesses include other mortgage lenders and title companies, including 

national, regional and local mortgage bankers and other financial institutions. Some of these competitors are subject to 
fewer governmental regulations and may have greater access to capital, and some of them may operate with different 
lending criteria and may offer a broader array of financing and other products and services to consumers than we do. 
However, we work diligently to provide flexible, fairly priced financing alternatives subject to applicable regulation.

Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters

The homebuilding industry is subject to extensive and complex regulations. We and the subcontractors we use 
must comply with many federal, state and local laws and regulations. These include zoning, density and development 
requirements and building, environmental, advertising, labor and real estate sales rules and regulations. These regulations 
and requirements affect substantially all aspects of our land development and home design, construction and sales 
processes in varying degrees across our markets. Our homes are inspected by local authorities where required, and 
homes eligible for insurance or guarantees provided by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and the Department 
of Veteran Affairs (VA) are subject to inspection by them. These regulations often provide broad discretion to the 
administering governmental authorities. In addition, our new housing developments may be subject to various 
assessments for schools, parks, streets, utilities and other public improvements.

Our homebuilding operations are also subject to an extensive array of local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, 
rules and regulations concerning protection of health, safety and the environment. The particular environmental laws for 
each site vary greatly according to location, environmental condition and the present and former uses of the site and 
adjoining properties.

Our mortgage company must comply with extensive state and federal laws and regulations, which are administered 
by numerous agencies, including but not limited to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), Federal Housing 
Finance Agency, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, FHA, VA, United States Department of 
Agriculture (USDA), Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae. These laws and regulations include many compliance 
requirements, including but not limited to licensing, consumer disclosures, fair lending and real estate settlement 
procedures. As a result, our operations are subject to regular, extensive examinations by the applicable agencies.

Seasonality

Although significant changes in market conditions have impacted our seasonal patterns in the past and could do so 
again in the future, we generally close more homes and generate greater revenues and operating income in the third and 
fourth quarters of our fiscal year. The seasonal nature of our business can also cause significant variations in our working 
capital requirements in both our homebuilding and financial services operations. As a result of seasonal activity, our 
quarterly results of operations and financial position at the end of a particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily 
representative of the balance of our fiscal year.

11

ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS

Discussion of our business and operations included in this annual report on Form 10-K should be read together 
with the risk factors set forth below. They describe various risks and uncertainties we are or may become subject to, 
many of which are difficult to predict or beyond our control. These risks and uncertainties, together with other factors 
described elsewhere in this report, have the potential to affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, 
cash flows, strategies or prospects in a material and adverse manner.

The homebuilding industry is cyclical and affected by changes in economic, real estate or other conditions that could 
adversely affect our business or financial results. 

The homebuilding industry is cyclical and is significantly affected by changes in general and local economic and 

real estate conditions, such as:

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

employment levels;

consumer confidence and spending;

housing demand;

availability of financing for homebuyers;

interest rates;

availability and prices of new homes for sale and alternatives to new homes, including foreclosed homes, 
homes held for sale by investors and speculators, other existing homes and rental properties; and

demographic trends.

Adverse changes in these general and local economic conditions or deterioration in the broader economy would 
cause a negative impact on our business and financial results and increase the risk for asset impairments and writeoffs. 
Changes in these economic conditions may affect some of our regions or markets more than others. If adverse conditions 
affect our larger markets, they could have a proportionately greater impact on us than on some other homebuilding 
companies.

In the past, concerns regarding the federal government’s fiscal policies and economic stimulus actions have created 

uncertainty in the financial markets and caused volatility in interest rates, which has impacted business and consumer 
confidence. Federal government actions and new legislation related to economic stimulus, taxation, spending levels and 
borrowing limits, along with the related political debates, conflicts and compromises associated with such actions, may 
negatively impact the financial markets and consumer confidence. Such events could hurt the U.S. economy and the 
housing market and in turn, could adversely affect the operating results of our homebuilding, financial services and other 
businesses.

Weather conditions and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, volcanic activity, droughts 
and floods, heavy or prolonged precipitation or wildfires, can harm our homebuilding business. These can delay our 
development work, home construction and home closings, adversely affect the cost or availability of materials or labor or 
damage homes under construction. The climates and geology of many of the states in which we operate, including 
California, Florida, Texas and other coastal areas, where we have some of our larger operations and which have 
experienced recent natural disasters, present increased risks of adverse weather or natural disasters.

Deployments of U.S. military personnel to foreign regions, terrorist attacks, other acts of violence or threats to 

national security and any corresponding response by the United States or others, related domestic or international 
instability or civil unrest may cause an economic slowdown in the markets where we operate, which could adversely 
affect our homebuilding business.

12

Public health issues such as a major epidemic or pandemic could adversely affect our business. The U.S. and other 

countries have experienced, and may experience in the future, outbreaks of contagious diseases that affect public 
perception of health risk. In the event of a widespread, prolonged, actual or perceived outbreak of a contagious disease, 
our operations could be negatively impacted by a reduction in customer traffic or other factors which could reduce 
demand for new homes.

If we experience any of the foregoing, potential customers may be less willing or able to buy our homes. In the 

future, our pricing and product strategies may also be limited by market conditions. We may be unable to change the mix 
of our home offerings, reduce the costs of the homes we build, offer more affordable homes or satisfactorily address 
changing market conditions in other ways without adversely affecting our profit margins. In addition, cancellations of 
home sales contracts in backlog may increase if homebuyers do not honor their contracts due to any of the factors 
discussed above.

Our financial services business is closely related to our homebuilding business, as it originates mortgage loans 

principally to purchasers of the homes we build. A decrease in the demand for our homes because of the foregoing 
matters will also adversely affect the financial results of this segment of our business. An increase in the default rate on 
the mortgages we originate may adversely affect our ability to sell the mortgages or the pricing we receive upon the sale 
of mortgages or may increase our recourse obligations for previous originations. We may be responsible for losses 
associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to third-party purchasers in the event of errors or omissions relating 
to certain representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements, including representations as to 
underwriting standards, the type of collateral, the existence of primary mortgage insurance, and the validity of certain 
borrower representations in the connection with the loan. We establish reserves related to mortgages we have sold; 
however, actual future obligations related to these mortgages could differ significantly from our current estimated 
amounts.

Constriction of the credit markets could limit our ability to access capital and increase our costs of capital. 

During past economic and housing downturns, the credit markets constricted and reduced some sources of liquidity 
that were previously available to us. Consequently, we relied principally on our cash on hand to meet our working capital 
needs and repay outstanding indebtedness during those times. There likely will be periods in the future when financial 
market upheaval will increase our cost of capital or limit our ability to access the public debt markets or obtain bank 
financing. 

We have a $1.275 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility with an uncommitted accordion feature that 
could increase the size of the facility to $1.9 billion, subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank 
commitments. The facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit with a sublimit equal to approximately 50% 
of the revolving credit commitment. The maturity date of the commitments under the facility is September 25, 2022. 
Also, our mortgage subsidiary utilizes a $600 million mortgage repurchase facility to finance the majority of the loans it 
originates. The capacity of the facility increases, without requiring additional commitments, to $725 million for 
approximately 30 days at each quarter end and to $800 million for approximately 45 days at fiscal year end. The capacity 
can also be increased to $1.0 billion subject to the availability of additional commitments. The mortgage repurchase 
facility must be renewed annually and currently expires on February 23, 2018. We expect to renew and extend the term 
of the mortgage repurchase facility with similar terms prior to its maturity. Adverse changes in market conditions could 
make the renewal of these facilities more difficult or could result in an increase in the cost of these facilities or a decrease 
in the committed amounts. Such changes affecting our mortgage repurchase facility may also make it more difficult or 
costly to sell the mortgages that we originate.

13

We regularly assess our projected capital requirements to fund growth in our business, repay debt obligations, and 

support other general corporate and operational needs, and we regularly evaluate our opportunities to raise additional 
capital. We have an automatically effective universal shelf registration statement filed with the SEC in August 2015, 
registering debt and equity securities that we may issue from time to time in amounts to be determined. As market 
conditions permit, we may issue new debt or equity securities through the public capital markets or obtain additional 
bank financing to fund our projected capital requirements or provide additional liquidity. In October 2017, we used cash 
on hand to purchase 75% of the outstanding shares of Forestar Group Inc. (Forestar) for $558.3 million. We believe that 
our existing cash resources, our revolving credit facility, our mortgage repurchase facility and our ability to access the 
capital markets will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our working capital needs and debt obligations, including the 
maturity of $400 million principal amount of senior notes in fiscal 2018. Adverse changes in economic, homebuilding or 
capital market conditions could negatively affect our business, liquidity and financial results, restrict our ability to obtain 
additional capital or increase our costs of capital.

Reductions in the availability of mortgage financing provided by government agencies, changes in government 
financing programs, a decrease in our ability to sell mortgage loans on attractive terms or an increase in mortgage 
interest rates could decrease our buyers’ ability to obtain financing and adversely affect our business or financial 
results.

The mortgage loans originated by our financial services operations are primarily eligible for sale to Fannie Mae, 

Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae and are sold to third-party purchasers. The secondary market for mortgage loans continues 
to primarily desire securities backed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae, and we believe the liquidity these 
agencies provide to the mortgage industry is important to the housing market. There have been ongoing discussions 
within the government regarding the long-term structure and viability of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which could 
result in adjustments to the size of their loan portfolios and to guidelines for their loan products. Any reduction in the 
availability of financing provided by these institutions could adversely affect interest rates, mortgage availability and 
sales of new homes and mortgage loans. During fiscal 2017, approximately 84% of our mortgage loans were sold to 
three major financial entities, one of which purchased 45% of the total loans sold. On an ongoing basis, we seek to 
establish loan purchase arrangements with additional financial entities. If we are unable to sell mortgage loans to 
purchasers on attractive terms, our ability to originate and sell mortgage loans at competitive prices could be limited, 
which would negatively affect our profitability.

The FHA insures mortgage loans that generally have lower credit requirements and is an important source for 

financing the sale of our homes. Changes, restrictions or significant premium increases in FHA programs in the future 
may negatively affect the availability or affordability of FHA financing, which could adversely affect our ability to sell 
homes.

Some of our customers may qualify for 100% financing through programs offered by the VA, USDA and certain 

other housing finance agencies. These programs are subject to changes in regulations, lending standards and government 
funding levels. There can be no assurances that these programs or other programs will continue to be available in our 
homebuilding markets or that they will be as attractive to our customers as the programs currently offered, which could 
negatively affect our sales. 

Mortgage rates are currently low as compared to most historical periods; however, they are expected to increase as 

the Federal Reserve Board has raised its benchmark rate several times over the past year and has indicated further 
interest rate increases are likely. When interest rates increase, the cost of owning a home will increase, which will likely 
reduce the number of potential homebuyers who can obtain mortgage financing, and could result in a decline in the 
demand for our homes.

14

The risks associated with our land and lot inventory could adversely affect our business or financial results. 

Inventory risks are substantial for our homebuilding business. There are risks inherent in controlling, owning and 

developing land. If housing demand declines, we may not be able to build and sell homes profitably in some of our 
communities, and we may not be able to fully recover the costs of some of the land and lots we own. Also, the values of 
our owned undeveloped land, lots and housing inventories may fluctuate significantly due to changes in market 
conditions. As a result, our deposits for lots controlled under option or similar contracts may be put at risk, we may have 
to sell homes or land for a lower profit margin or record inventory impairment charges on our land and lots. A significant 
deterioration in economic or homebuilding industry conditions may result in substantial inventory impairment charges.

We cannot make any assurances that our growth strategies, acquisitions or investments will be successful or will not 
expose us to additional risks or other negative consequences. 

In recent years, we have primarily grown our business by increasing our investments in land, lot and home 

inventories in our existing homebuilding markets. We have also expanded through investments in new product offerings 
and in new geographic markets. Investments in land, lots and home inventories can expose us to risks of economic loss 
and inventory impairments if housing conditions weaken or if we are unsuccessful in implementing our growth 
strategies.

Subsequent to September 30, 2017, we made an investment of $558.3 million in cash to acquire 75% of the 

outstanding shares of Forestar, pursuant to the terms of the June 2017 merger agreement. Forestar is and will continue to 
be a publicly-traded residential and real estate development company with operations currently in 14 markets and 10 
states, where it owns, directly or through joint ventures, interests in 44 residential and mixed-use projects. Our alignment 
with Forestar advances our strategy of increasing our access to high-quality optioned land and lot positions to enhance 
operational efficiency and returns. Both companies are identifying land development opportunities to expand Forestar’s 
platform, and we plan to acquire a large portion of Forestar’s finished lots in accordance with the master supply 
agreement between the two companies. 

In addition to the investment and merger with Forestar, we have acquired the homebuilding operations of several 

companies since fiscal 2012, and we may make strategic acquisitions of or investments in other companies, operations or 
assets in the future. Such acquisitions and investments may have risks similar to those related to land, lots and home 
inventories, but they may also expose us to additional risks or other negative consequences. These transactions may not 
advance our business strategy, provide a satisfactory return on our investment or provide other benefits we anticipate. 
Also, the integration of these transactions may not be successful and may require significant time and resources, which 
may divert management’s attention from other operations. Acquisitions and investments could also expose us to material 
liabilities not discovered in the due diligence process and may lead to litigation. If these transactions under-perform our 
expectations or are unsuccessful, we may incur significant expenses or write-offs of inventory, other assets or intangible 
assets such as goodwill. Acquisitions and investments can result in dilution to existing stockholders if we issue our 
common stock as consideration, and can increase our debt levels or reduce our liquidity if we purchase them with cash. 
The magnitude, timing and nature of any future acquisitions or investments will depend on a number of factors, 
including our ability to identify suitable additional markets or acquisition candidates, the negotiation of acceptable terms, 
our financial capabilities and general economic and business conditions. We also may seek to divest an investment or a 
business and may have difficulty selling such investment or business on acceptable terms in a timely manner.

Homebuilding is subject to home warranty and construction defect claims in the ordinary course of business that can 
be significant. 

We are subject to home warranty and construction defect claims arising in the ordinary course of our homebuilding 

business. We rely on subcontractors to perform the actual construction of our homes, and in many cases, to select and 
obtain construction materials. Despite our detailed specifications and monitoring of the construction process, our 
subcontractors occasionally do not meet adequate quality standards in the construction of our homes. When we find these 
issues, we repair them in accordance with our warranty obligations. We spend significant resources to repair items in 
homes we have sold to fulfill the warranties we issued to our homebuyers. Additionally, we are subject to construction 
defect claims which can be costly to defend and resolve in the legal system. Warranty and construction defect matters 
can also result in negative publicity in the media and on the internet, which can damage our reputation and adversely 
affect our ability to sell homes.

15

Based on the large number of homes we have sold over the years, our potential liabilities related to warranty and 
construction defect claims are significant. As a consequence, we maintain product liability insurance, and we seek to 
obtain indemnities and certificates of insurance from subcontractors covering claims related to their workmanship and 
materials. We establish warranty and other reserves for the homes we sell based on historical experience in our markets 
and our judgment of the qualitative risks associated with the types of homes built. Because of the uncertainties inherent 
to these matters, we cannot provide assurance that our insurance coverage, our subcontractor arrangements and our 
reserves will be adequate to address all of our future warranty and construction defect claims. Contractual indemnities 
can be difficult to enforce, we may be responsible for applicable self-insured retentions and some types of claims may 
not be covered by insurance or may exceed applicable coverage limits. Additionally, the coverage offered by and the 
availability of product liability insurance for construction defects is limited and costly. We have responded to increases in 
insurance costs and coverage limitations by increasing our self-insured retentions and claim reserves. There can be no 
assurance that coverage will not be further restricted or become more costly. If costs to resolve our future warranty and 
construction defect claims exceed our estimates, our financial results and liquidity could be adversely affected.

A health and safety incident relating to our operations could be costly in terms of potential liability and reputational 
damage.
 

Building sites are inherently dangerous, and operating in the homebuilding industry poses certain inherent health 

and safety risks. Due to health and safety regulatory requirements and the number of homes we construct, health and 
safety performance is critical to the success of our business. Any failure in health and safety performance may result in 
penalties for non-compliance with relevant regulatory requirements, and a failure that results in a major or significant 
health and safety incident is likely to be costly and could expose us to liability that could be costly. Such an incident 
could generate significant negative publicity and have a corresponding impact on our reputation, our relationships with 
relevant regulatory agencies or governmental authorities, and our ability to attract customers and employees, which in 
turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and liquidity.

Damage to our corporate reputation or brands from negative publicity could adversely affect our business, financial 
results and/or stock price.

Adverse publicity related to our company, industry, personnel, operations or business performance may cause 

damage to our corporate reputation or brands and may generate negative sentiment, potentially affecting the performance 
of our business or our stock price, regardless of its accuracy or inaccuracy. Negative publicity can be disseminated 
rapidly through digital platforms, including social media, websites, blogs and newsletters. Customers and other 
interested parties value readily available information and often act on such information without further investigation and 
without regard to its accuracy. The harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction, 
and our success in preserving our brand image depends on our ability to recognize, respond to and effectively manage 
negative publicity in a rapidly changing environment. Adverse publicity or unfavorable commentary from any source 
could damage our reputation, reduce the demand for our homes or negatively impact the morale and performance of our 
employees, which could adversely affect our business.

Supply shortages and other risks related to acquiring land, building materials and skilled labor could increase our 
costs and delay deliveries. 

The homebuilding industry has from time to time experienced significant difficulties that can affect the cost or 

timing of construction, including:

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

difficulty in acquiring land suitable for residential building at affordable prices in locations where our 
potential customers want to live;

shortages of qualified subcontractors;

reliance on local subcontractors, manufacturers and distributors who may be inadequately capitalized;

shortages of materials; and

volatile increases in the cost of materials, particularly increases in the price of lumber, drywall and cement, 
which are significant components of home construction costs.

16

These factors may increase our build times or cause us to incur more costs building our homes. If the level of new 

home demand increases significantly in future periods, the risk of shortages in residential lots, labor and materials 
available to the homebuilding industry will likely increase.

Our business and financial results could be adversely affected by significant inflation, higher interest rates or 
deflation. 

Inflation can adversely affect us by increasing costs of land, materials and labor. In addition, significant inflation is 

often accompanied by higher interest rates, which have a negative impact on housing affordability. In a highly 
inflationary environment, depending on industry and other economic conditions, we may be precluded from raising 
home prices enough to keep up with the rate of inflation, which could reduce our profit margins. Moreover, with 
inflation, the costs of capital, labor and materials can increase and the purchasing power of our cash resources can 
decline. Current or future efforts by the government to stimulate the economy may increase the risk of significant 
inflation and its adverse impact on our business or financial results. 

Alternatively, a significant period of deflation could cause a decrease in overall spending and borrowing levels. 
This could lead to deterioration in economic conditions, including an increase in the rate of unemployment. Deflation 
could also cause the value of our inventories to decline or reduce the value of existing homes below the related mortgage 
loan balance, which could potentially increase the supply of existing homes. If oil prices decline significantly, economic 
conditions in markets that have significant exposure to the energy sector may weaken. These, or other factors that 
increase the risk of significant deflation, could have a negative impact on our business or financial results.

We are required to obtain performance bonds, the unavailability of which could adversely affect our results of 
operations and cash flows.

We often are required to provide surety bonds to secure our performance or obligations under construction 

contracts, development agreements and other arrangements. At September 30, 2017, we had $1.2 billion of outstanding 
surety bonds. Our ability to obtain surety bonds primarily depends upon our credit rating, financial condition, past 
performance and other factors, including the capacity of the surety market and the underwriting practices of surety bond 
issuers. The ability to obtain surety bonds also can be impacted by the willingness of insurance companies to issue 
performance bonds for construction and development activities. If we are unable to obtain surety bonds when required, 
our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.

Increases in the costs of owning a home could prevent potential customers from buying our homes and adversely 
affect our business or financial results. 

Significant expenses of owning a home, including mortgage interest and real estate taxes, generally are deductible 
expenses for an individual’s federal, and in some cases state, income taxes, subject to various limitations under current 
tax law and policy. If the federal government or a state government changes its income tax laws, as has been discussed 
from time to time, to eliminate or substantially modify these income tax deductions, the after-tax cost of owning a new 
home would increase for many of our potential customers. The loss or reduction of homeowner tax deductions, if such 
tax law changes were enacted without offsetting provisions, could adversely affect demand for and sales prices of new 
homes. 

In addition, increases in property tax rates by local governmental authorities, as experienced in some areas in 

response to reduced federal and state funding, could adversely affect the amount of financing our potential customers 
could obtain or their desire to purchase new homes.

17

Governmental regulations and environmental matters could increase the cost and limit the availability of our 
development and homebuilding projects and adversely affect our business or financial results. 

We are subject to extensive and complex regulations that affect land development and home construction, including 

zoning, density restrictions, building design and building standards. These regulations often provide broad discretion to 
the administering governmental authorities as to the conditions we must meet prior to development or construction being 
approved, if approved at all. We are subject to determinations by these authorities as to the adequacy of water or sewage 
facilities, roads or other local services. New housing developments may also be subject to various assessments for 
schools, parks, streets and other public improvements. In addition, in many markets government authorities have 
implemented no growth or growth control initiatives. Any of these may limit, delay or increase the costs of development 
or home construction. 

We are also subject to a significant number and variety of local, state and federal laws and regulations concerning 

protection of health, safety, labor standards and the environment. The impact of environmental laws varies depending 
upon the prior uses of the building site or adjoining properties and may be greater in areas with less supply where 
undeveloped land or desirable alternatives are less available. These matters may result in delays, may cause us to incur 
substantial compliance, remediation, mitigation and other costs, and can prohibit or severely restrict development and 
homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas. Government agencies also routinely initiate audits, 
reviews or investigations of our business practices to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, which can 
cause us to incur costs or create other disruptions in our business that can be significant. For example, we have received 
Notices of Violation from the United States Environmental Protection Agency related to stormwater compliance at 
certain of our sites in the Southeast. This matter could potentially result in requirements for us to perform additional 
compliance procedures and to pay monetary sanctions.

The subcontractors we rely on to perform the actual construction of our homes are also subject to a significant 

number of local, state and federal laws and regulations, including laws involving matters that are not within our control. 
If the subcontractors who construct our homes fail to comply with all applicable laws, we can suffer reputational 
damage, and may be exposed to possible liability. 

We are also subject to an extensive number of laws and regulations because our common stock and debt securities 
are publicly traded in the capital markets. These regulations govern our communications with our shareholders and the 
capital markets, our financial statement disclosures and our legal processes, and they also impact the work required to be 
performed by our independent registered public accounting firm and our legal counsel. Changes in these laws and 
regulations, including the subsequent implementation of rules by the administering government authorities, may require 
us to incur additional compliance costs, and such costs may be significant.

Governmental regulation of our financial services operations could adversely affect our business or financial results.

Our financial services operations are subject to extensive state and federal laws and regulations, which are 

administered by numerous agencies, including but not limited to the CFPB, Federal Housing Finance Agency, U.S. 
Department of Housing and Urban Development, FHA, VA, USDA, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae. These 
laws and regulations include many compliance requirements, including but not limited to licensing, consumer 
disclosures, fair lending and real estate settlement procedures. As a result, our operations are subject to regular, extensive 
examinations by the applicable agencies.

In fiscal 2013, our mortgage subsidiary was subpoenaed by the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) 

regarding the adequacy of certain underwriting and quality control processes related to FHA loans originated and sold in 
prior years. We have provided information related to these loans and our processes to the DOJ, and communications are 
ongoing. The DOJ has to date not asserted any formal claim amount, penalty or fine.

Due to the significant increases in regulations, operating costs have increased for our mortgage operations. The 

possibility of additional future regulations, changing rule interpretations and examinations by regulatory agencies may 
result in more stringent compliance standards and could adversely affect the results of our operations.

18

We have significant amounts of consolidated debt and may incur additional debt; our debt obligations and our ability 
to comply with related covenants, restrictions or limitations could adversely affect our financial condition.

As of September 30, 2017, our consolidated debt was $2.9 billion, and we had $829.6 million principal amount of 

our debt maturing before the end of fiscal 2018, including $400 million principal amount of senior notes and $420 
million outstanding under the mortgage repurchase facility. The indenture governing our senior notes does not restrict the 
incurrence of future unsecured debt by us or our homebuilding subsidiaries or the incurrence of secured or unsecured 
debt by our financial services subsidiaries, and the agreement governing our revolving credit facility allows us to incur a 
substantial amount of future unsecured debt. Also, the indenture governing our senior notes and the agreement governing 
our revolving credit facility impose restrictions on our ability and on that of the guarantors to incur debt secured by 
certain assets, but still permit us and our homebuilding subsidiaries to incur significant amounts of additional secured 
debt.

Possible consequences. The amount and the maturities of our debt could have important consequences. For 

example, they could:

• 

• 

• 

require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payment of our debt and 
reduce our ability to use our cash flow for other operating or investing purposes;

limit our flexibility to adjust to changes in our business or economic conditions; and

limit our ability to obtain future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service 
requirements or other requirements.

In addition, our debt obligations and the restrictions imposed by the instruments governing those obligations 

expose us to additional risks, including:

Dependence on future performance. Our ability to meet our debt service and other obligations and the financial 
covenants under our revolving credit and mortgage repurchase facilities will depend, in part, upon our future financial 
performance. Our future results are subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this report. Our revenues and 
earnings vary with the level of general economic activity in the markets we serve. Our businesses are also affected by 
financial, political, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. The factors that affect our ability 
to generate cash can also affect our ability to raise additional funds for these purposes through the sale of debt or equity, 
the refinancing of debt or the sale of assets. Changes in prevailing interest rates may affect the cost of our debt service 
obligations, because borrowings under our revolving credit facility and mortgage repurchase facility bear interest at 
floating rates. 

Revolving credit facility. Our revolving credit facility contains financial covenants requiring the maintenance of a 

maximum allowable ratio of debt to tangible net worth and a borrowing base restriction if our ratio of debt to tangible net 
worth exceeds a certain level. A failure to comply with these requirements could allow the lending banks to terminate the 
availability of funds under our revolving credit facility or cause any outstanding borrowings to become due and payable 
prior to maturity.

Mortgage repurchase facility and other restrictions. The mortgage repurchase facility for our mortgage subsidiary 

requires the maintenance of a minimum level of tangible net worth, a maximum allowable ratio of debt to tangible net 
worth and a minimum level of liquidity by our mortgage subsidiary. A failure to comply with these requirements could 
allow the lending banks to terminate the availability of funds to our mortgage subsidiary or cause any outstanding 
borrowings to become due and payable prior to maturity. Any difficulty experienced in complying with these covenants 
could make the renewal of the facility more difficult or costly. 

19

In addition, although our financial services business is conducted through subsidiaries that are not restricted by the 
indenture governing our senior notes or the agreement governing our revolving credit facility, the ability of our financial 
services subsidiaries to distribute funds to our homebuilding operations would be restricted in the event such distribution 
would cause an event of default under the mortgage repurchase facility or if an event of default had occurred under this 
facility. Moreover, our right to receive assets from these subsidiaries upon their liquidation or recapitalization is subject 
to the prior claims of the creditors of these subsidiaries. Any claims we may have to funds from our financial services 
subsidiaries would be subordinate to subsidiary indebtedness to the extent of any security for such indebtedness and to 
any indebtedness otherwise recognized as senior to our claims.

Changes in debt ratings. Our senior unsecured debt is currently rated investment grade by all three major rating 

agencies; however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain this rating. Any lowering of our debt 
ratings could make accessing the public capital markets or obtaining additional credit from banks more difficult and/or 
more expensive. 

Change of control purchase options and change of control default. Upon the occurrence of both a change of control 

and a ratings downgrade event, each as defined in the indenture governing our senior notes, we will be required to offer 
to repurchase such notes at 101% of their principal amount, together with all accrued and unpaid interest, if any. 
Moreover, a change of control (as defined in our revolving credit facility) would constitute an event of default under our 
revolving credit facility, which could result in the acceleration of the repayment of any borrowings outstanding under our 
revolving credit facility, a requirement to cash collateralize all letters of credit outstanding thereunder and the 
termination of the commitments thereunder. If repayment of more than $50 million outstanding under our revolving 
credit facility were accelerated and such acceleration were not rescinded or such indebtedness were not satisfied, in 
either case within 30 days, an event of default would result under the indenture governing our senior notes, entitling the 
trustee for the notes or holders of at least 25 percent in principal amount of the relevant series of notes then outstanding 
to declare all such notes to be due and payable immediately. If purchase offers were required under the indenture for our 
notes, repayment of the borrowings under our revolving credit facility were required, or if our senior notes were 
accelerated, we can give no assurance that we would have sufficient funds to pay the required amounts.

Homebuilding and financial services are very competitive industries, and competitive conditions could adversely 
affect our business or financial results. 

The homebuilding industry is highly competitive. Homebuilders compete not only for homebuyers, but also for 

desirable properties, financing, raw materials and skilled labor. We compete with local, regional and national 
homebuilders, and also with existing home sales, foreclosures and rental properties. The competitive conditions in the 
homebuilding industry can negatively affect our sales volumes, selling prices and incentive levels, reduce our profit 
margins, and cause the value of our inventory or other assets to be impaired. Competition can also affect our ability to 
acquire suitable land, raw materials and skilled labor at acceptable prices or terms, or cause delays in the construction of 
our homes.

The competitors to our financial services businesses include other title companies and mortgage lenders, including 

national, regional and local mortgage banks and other financial institutions. Some of these competitors are subject to 
fewer governmental regulations and have greater access to capital than we do, and some of them may operate with 
different lending criteria than we do. These competitors may offer a broader or more attractive array of financing and 
other products and services to potential customers than we do.

Our homebuilding and financial services businesses compete with other companies across all industries to attract 

and retain highly skilled and experienced employees, managers and executives. Competition for the services of these 
individuals increases as business conditions improve in the homebuilding and financial services industries and in the 
general economy. If we are unable to attract and retain key employees, managers or executives, our business could be 
adversely affected.

20

Our business could be adversely affected by the loss of key personnel.

We rely on our key personnel to effectively operate and manage our homebuilding and financial services 

businesses. Specifically, our success depends heavily on the performance of our homebuilding division and region 
presidents and their management teams, our financial services management team, our corporate office management 
teams and our executive officers. These key personnel have significant experience and skills in the homebuilding and 
financial services industries, as well as leadership and management abilities that are important to our success. We seek to 
retain our key personnel and to have succession plans in place to address the potential loss of key personnel. However, if 
our retention and succession planning efforts are unsuccessful or if we fail to attract suitable replacements, the loss of 
key personnel could adversely affect our business.

Information technology failures and data security breaches could harm our business. 

We use information technology and other computer resources to carry out important operational and marketing 

activities and to maintain our business records. These information technology systems are dependent upon global 
communications providers, web browsers, third-party software and data storage providers and other aspects of the 
Internet infrastructure that have experienced security breaches, cyber-attacks, significant systems failures and service 
outages in the past. A material breach in the security of our information technology systems or other data security 
controls could include the theft or release of customer, employee or company data. A data security breach, a significant 
and extended disruption in the functioning of our information technology systems or a breach of any of our data security 
controls could disrupt our business operations, damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers, adversely impact 
our sales and revenue and require us to incur significant expense to address and remediate or otherwise resolve these 
kinds of issues. The release of confidential information as a result of a security breach could also lead to litigation or 
other proceedings against us by affected individuals or business partners, or by regulators, and the outcome of such 
proceedings, which could include penalties or fines, could have a significant negative impact on our business. We may 
also be required to incur significant costs to protect against damages caused by information technology failures or 
security breaches in the future. We routinely utilize information technology security experts to assist us in our 
evaluations of the effectiveness of the security of our information technology systems, and we regularly enhance our 
security measures to protect our systems and data. However, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, 
disable or degrade systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be 
unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Consequently, we cannot provide 
assurances that a security breach, cyber-attack, data theft or other significant systems or security failures will not occur in 
the future, and such occurrences could have a material and adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or 
financial position.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

In addition to our inventories of land, lots and homes, we own office buildings totaling approximately 

1,000,000 square feet, and we lease approximately 529,000 square feet of office space under leases expiring through 
November 2023. These properties are located in our various operating markets to house our homebuilding and financial 
services operating divisions and our regional and corporate offices.

We own ranch land and improvements totaling approximately 93,600 acres which we use to conduct ranching and 

agricultural activities and to host company meetings and events.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We are involved in lawsuits and other contingencies in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome of such 
contingencies cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the liabilities arising from these matters will not have a 
material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, to the extent 
the liability arising from the ultimate resolution of any matter exceeds our estimates reflected in the recorded reserves 
relating to such matter, we could incur additional charges that could be significant.

In May and July of 2014, we received Notices of Violation from the United States Environmental Protection 

Agency related to stormwater compliance at certain of our sites in the Southeast. This matter could potentially result in 
monetary sanctions to the Company; however, we do not believe it is reasonably possible that this matter would result in 
a loss that would have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In fiscal 2013, our mortgage subsidiary was subpoenaed by the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) 

regarding the adequacy of certain underwriting and quality control processes related to Federal Housing Administration 
loans originated and sold in prior years. We have provided information related to these loans and our processes to the 
DOJ, and communications are ongoing. The DOJ has to date not asserted any formal claim amount, penalty or fine.

As of November 8, 2017, the closing price of our common stock on the NYSE was $45.41, and there were 

approximately 373 holders of record.

In November 2017, our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend of $0.125 per common share, payable on 
December 15, 2017, to stockholders of record on December 1, 2017. The declaration of future cash dividends is at the 
discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon, among other things, our future earnings, cash flows, capital 
requirements, financial condition and general business conditions.

The information required by this item with respect to equity compensation plans is set forth under Item 12 of this 

annual report on Form 10-K and is incorporated herein by reference.

During fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, we did not sell any equity securities that were not registered under the 

Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

Effective August 1, 2016, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $100 million of our common 
stock effective through July 31, 2017. During the third quarter of fiscal 2017, we repurchased 1,850,000 shares of our 
common stock for $60.6 million, resulting in a remaining authorization of $39.4 million. Effective August 1, 2017, our 
Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $200 million of our common stock effective through July 31, 2018. 
As there were no repurchases of common stock during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, all of the $200 million 
authorization was remaining at September 30, 2017, and no common stock has been repurchased subsequent to 
September 30, 2017.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Results of Operations — Fiscal Year 2017 Overview

During fiscal 2017, demand for new homes continued to reflect the stable to moderately improved trends we 

experienced across most of our operating markets in fiscal 2016. We continue to see varying levels of strength in new 
home demand and home prices across our markets, with demand in each market generally reflecting the relative strength 
of each market’s economy, as measured by job growth, household incomes, household formations and consumer 
confidence.

Our position as the largest and most geographically diverse homebuilder in the United States provides a strong 

platform for us to compete for new home sales. In recent years, we have focused on expanding our product offerings to 
more consistently include a broad range of homes for entry-level, move-up and luxury buyers across most of our 
markets. Our affordable entry-level homes have experienced very strong demand from homebuyers, as the entry-level 
segment of the new home market remains under-served, with low inventory levels relative to demand. Since the fourth 
quarter of fiscal 2016, we have been introducing affordable homes in communities designed for active adult buyers 
seeking a low-maintenance lifestyle. We plan to continue to expand our product offerings across more of our operating 
markets.

We believe our business is well positioned because of our broad geographic footprint and diverse product offerings, 
our ample supply of finished lots, land and homes, our strong balance sheet and liquidity and our experienced personnel 
across our operating markets. We remain focused on growing our revenues and profitability, generating positive annual 
cash flows from operations and managing our product offerings, pricing, sales pace, and inventory levels to optimize the 
return on our inventory investments.

In fiscal 2017, our number of homes closed and home sales revenues increased 14% and 16%, respectively, 

compared to the prior year. Our pre-tax income grew to $1.6 billion in fiscal 2017 compared to $1.4 billion in fiscal 2016 
and $1.1 billion in fiscal 2015. Our pre-tax operating margin increased to 11.4% in fiscal 2017 compared to 11.1% in 
fiscal 2016 and 10.4% in fiscal 2015. Cash provided by operations was $435.1 million in fiscal 2017 compared to $618.0 
million in fiscal 2016 and $700.4 million in fiscal 2015. In fiscal 2017, our homebuilding return on inventory (ROI) 
improved to 16.6% compared to 15.4% in fiscal 2016 and 12.8% in fiscal 2015. Homebuilding ROI is calculated as 
homebuilding pre-tax income for the year divided by average inventory. Average inventory in the ROI calculation is the 
sum of ending inventory balances for the trailing five quarters divided by five.

During the year, we also made significant progress in increasing our lots controlled under option purchase contracts 

to 50% of our total lots owned and controlled compared to 45% in the prior year. The transaction with Forestar Group 
Inc. (Forestar), which closed subsequent to year end, is expected to advance our strategy of increasing our access to high-
quality optioned land and lot positions.

We believe that housing demand in our individual operating markets is tied closely to each market’s economy; 
therefore, we expect that housing market conditions will vary across our markets. If the U.S. economy continues to 
improve, we expect to see slow to moderate growth in housing demand, concentrated in markets where job growth is 
occurring. The pace and sustainability of new home demand and our future results could be negatively affected by 
weakening economic conditions, decreases in the level of employment and housing demand, decreased home 
affordability, significant increases in mortgage interest rates or tightening of mortgage lending standards.

26

Strategy

Our operating strategy focuses on leveraging our financial and competitive position to increase the returns on our 
inventory investments and generate strong profitability and cash flows, while managing risk. This strategy includes the 
following initiatives:

•  Maintaining a strong cash balance and overall liquidity position and controlling our level of debt.

•  Allocating and actively managing our inventory investments across our operating markets to diversify our 

geographic risk.

•  Offering new home communities that appeal to a broad range of entry-level, move-up, active adult and luxury 

homebuyers based on consumer demand in each market.

•  Modifying product offerings, sales pace, home prices and sales incentives as necessary in each of our markets 

to meet consumer demand.

•  Managing our inventory of homes under construction relative to demand in each of our markets, including 
starting construction on unsold homes to capture new home demand and actively controlling the number of 
unsold, completed homes in inventory.

• 

• 

Investing in land and land development and pursuing opportunistic acquisitions of homebuilding companies 
in desirable markets, while controlling the level of land and lots we own in each of our markets relative to the 
local new home demand.

Increasing the amount of land and finished lots controlled through option purchase contracts by expanding 
relationships with land developers across the country.

•  Controlling the cost of goods purchased from both vendors and subcontractors.

• 

Improving the efficiency of our land development, construction, sales and other key operational activities.

•  Controlling our selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense infrastructure to match production 

levels.

We believe our operating strategy, which has produced positive results in recent years, will allow us to maintain 

and improve our financial and competitive position and balance sheet strength. However, we cannot provide any 
assurances that the initiatives listed above will continue to be successful, and we may need to adjust components of our 
strategy to meet future market conditions.

(1)  Cancellation rate represents the number of cancelled sales orders divided by gross sales orders.

Net Sales Orders

2017 versus 2016

The value of net sales orders increased 16% to $13.9 billion (46,605 homes) in 2017 from $12.0 billion (40,814 

homes) in 2016, with increases in all of our regions. The increase in the value of sales orders was due to increased 
volume and to a lesser extent, increased selling prices in some regions.

The number of net sales orders increased 14%, and the average price of net sales orders increased 2% to $299,100 

during 2017 compared to 2016. The increase in net sales orders reflects the continued stable to moderately improved 
market conditions in most of our markets. Our Phoenix market contributed the most to the higher volume in our 
Southwest region and our Carolina markets contributed most to the higher volume in our East region. Our sales order 
cancellation rate (cancelled sales orders divided by gross sales orders for the period) was 22% in fiscal 2017 compared to 
23% in 2016.

We believe our business is well positioned to continue to generate increased sales volumes; however, our future 
sales volumes will depend on the economic strength of each of our operating markets and our ability to successfully 
implement our operating strategies.

2016 versus 2015

The value of net sales orders increased 12% to $12.0 billion (40,814 homes) in 2016 from $10.7 billion (37,380 

homes) in 2015, with increases in all of our regions. The increase in the value of sales orders was due to increased 
volume and to a lesser extent, increased selling prices in most regions.

The number of net sales orders increased 9%, and the average price of net sales orders increased 2% to $294,000 
during 2016 compared to 2015. Our Florida markets contributed most to the higher volume in our Southeast region and 
our Las Vegas market contributed most to the higher volume in our West region.

Sales order backlog represents homes under contract but not yet closed at the end of the period. Many of the 

contracts in our sales order backlog are subject to contingencies, including mortgage loan approval and buyers selling 
their existing homes, which can result in cancellations. A portion of the contracts in backlog will not result in closings 
due to cancellations.

Revenues from home sales increased 16% to $13.7 billion (45,751 homes closed) in 2017 from $11.8 

billion (40,309 homes closed) in 2016. The increase in home sales revenues reflects the continued stable to moderately 
improved market conditions in most of our markets.

The number of homes closed in fiscal 2017 increased 14% from 2016 due to increases in all of our regions. Our 
Phoenix, Florida and Carolina markets contributed the most to higher closing volumes in our Southwest, Southeast and 
East regions, respectively. The average selling price of homes closed during fiscal 2017 was $298,400, up 2% from the 
prior year.

2016 versus 2015

Revenues from home sales increased 13% to $11.8 billion (40,309 homes closed) in 2016 from $10.5 billion 

(36,648 homes closed) in 2015.

The number of homes closed in fiscal 2016 increased 10% from 2015 due to increases in most of our regions. Our 

Florida and Phoenix markets contributed the most to higher closing volumes in our Southeast and Southwest regions, 
respectively. The decrease in homes closed in our Midwest region was primarily due to lower volume in our Chicago and 
Denver markets.

Gross profit from home sales increased 15% to $2.7 billion in 2017 from $2.4 billion in 2016 and decreased 

20 basis points to 20.0% as a percentage of home sales revenues. The 20 basis point decrease in the home sales gross 
profit percentage resulted from a decrease of 50 basis points due to an increase in warranty and construction defect 
expenses as a percentage of home sales revenues, partially offset by an improvement of 30 basis points due to a decrease 
in the amortization of capitalized interest and property taxes.

2016 versus 2015

Gross profit from home sales increased 15% to $2.4 billion in 2016 from $2.1 billion in 2015 and increased 

40 basis points to 20.2% as a percentage of home sales revenues. The 40 basis point increase in the home sales gross 
profit percentage resulted from improvements of 30 basis points due to the average selling price of our homes closed 
increasing by more than the average cost and 10 basis points due to a decrease in the amortization of capitalized interest 
and property taxes as a percentage of home sales revenues.

We remain focused on managing the pricing, incentives and sales pace in each of our communities to optimize the 

returns on our inventory investments and adjust to local market conditions. Our gross profit margins have remained 
relatively stable in recent years and based on current market conditions, we expect continued stability; however, our 
gross profit margins could fluctuate in future periods.

33

Land Sales and Other Revenues

Land sales and other revenues were $88.3 million, $78.7 million and $89.6 million in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, 

respectively. We continually evaluate our land and lot supply, and fluctuations in revenues and profitability from land 
sales occur based on how we manage our inventory levels in various markets. We generally purchase land and lots with 
the intent to build and sell homes on them. However, some of the land that we purchase includes commercially zoned 
parcels that we may sell to commercial developers. We may also sell residential lots or land parcels to manage our supply 
or for other strategic reasons. As of September 30, 2017, we had $10.4 million of land held for sale that we expect to sell 
in the next twelve months.

Inventory and Land Option Charges

At the end of each quarter during fiscal 2017, we reviewed the performance and outlook for all of our communities 
and land inventories for indicators of potential impairment and performed detailed impairment evaluations and analyses 
when necessary. As of September 30, 2017, we performed detailed impairment evaluations of communities and land 
inventories with a combined carrying value of $105.3 million and recorded impairment charges of $12.8 million during 
the fourth quarter to reduce the carrying value of impaired communities and land to their estimated fair value. Total 
impairment charges during fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $23.2 million, $20.3 million and $44.9 million, respectively.

As we manage our inventory investments across our operating markets to optimize returns and cash flows, we may 

modify our pricing and incentives, construction and development plans or land sale strategies in individual active 
communities and land held for development, which could result in the affected communities being evaluated for 
potential impairment. Also, if housing or economic conditions weaken in specific markets in which we operate, or if 
conditions weaken in the broader economy or homebuilding industry, we may be required to evaluate additional 
communities for potential impairment. These evaluations could result in additional impairment charges.

During fiscal 2017, we wrote off $17.0 million of earnest money deposits and pre-acquisition costs related to land 

option contracts that we have terminated or expect to terminate. Earnest money and pre-acquisition cost write-offs for 
fiscal 2016 and 2015 were $11.1 million and $15.4 million, respectively.

Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expense

SG&A expense related to homebuilding activities was $1.2 billion, $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion in fiscal 2017, 

2016 and 2015, respectively, increasing 11% in 2017 and 10% in 2016 from the respective prior years. As a percentage 
of homebuilding revenues, SG&A expense decreased 40 basis points to 8.9% in 2017 and decreased 20 basis points to 
9.3% in 2016 from the respective prior years. This improvement in SG&A expense as a percentage of homebuilding 
revenues was achieved primarily through leverage of our fixed overhead costs resulting from the increase in 
homebuilding revenues.

Employee compensation and related costs were $860.2 million, $748.7 million and $679.4 million in fiscal 2017, 

2016 and 2015, respectively. Compensation costs represented 70% of SG&A costs in fiscal 2017 and 68% of SG&A 
costs in both fiscal 2016 and 2015. These costs increased 15% in 2017 and 10% in 2016 due to increases in the number 
of employees and the amount of incentive compensation as compared to the respective prior years. Our homebuilding 
operations employed 5,876, 5,366 and 4,888 employees at September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

We attempt to control our SG&A costs while ensuring that our infrastructure adequately supports our operations; 
however, we cannot make assurances that we will be able to maintain or improve upon the current SG&A expense as a 
percentage of revenues.

34

Interest Incurred

We capitalize interest costs incurred to inventory during active development and construction (active inventory). 

Capitalized interest is charged to cost of sales as the related inventory is delivered to the buyer. Interest incurred 
decreased 15% to $129.3 million in fiscal 2017 and decreased 10% to $152.3 million in fiscal 2016 compared to the 
respective prior years. These decreases were due to decreases in our average debt of 12% and 9% in fiscal 2017 and 
2016, respectively, and lower average interest rates on outstanding debt during the periods. Interest charged to cost of 
sales was 1.4%, 1.8% and 1.9% of total cost of sales (excluding inventory and land option charges) in fiscal 2017, 2016 
and 2015, respectively.

Other Income

Other income, net of other expenses, included in our homebuilding operations was $11.0 million, $12.7 million 
and $7.8 million in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Other income in fiscal 2016 included a $4.5 million gain 
from the sale of an investment in debt securities. Other income consists of interest income, rental income and various 
other types of ancillary income, gains, expenses and losses not directly associated with sales of homes, land and lots. The 
activities that result in this ancillary income or expense are not significant, either individually or in the aggregate.

Goodwill Impairment

We performed our annual goodwill impairment evaluation in the fourth quarters of fiscal 2017 and 2016. As a 

result of the 2017 evaluation, no impairment charges were recorded. As a result of the 2016 evaluation, a $7.2 million 
impairment charge was recorded to reduce the goodwill in the Huntsville operating segment in our Southeast reporting 
region. This operating segment had experienced lower levels of profitability than anticipated primarily due to difficult 
market conditions. See Note A.

Business Acquisitions

In September 2016, we acquired the homebuilding operations of Wilson Parker Homes for $91.9 million. Wilson 

Parker Homes operated in Atlanta and Augusta, Georgia; Raleigh, North Carolina; Columbia, South Carolina and 
Phoenix, Arizona. The assets acquired included approximately 380 homes in inventory, 490 lots and control of 
approximately 1,850 additional lots through option contracts. We also acquired a sales order backlog of 308 homes 
valued at $74.1 million.

Subsequent to September 30, 2017, we acquired 75% of the outstanding shares of Forestar for $558.3 million in 

cash, pursuant to the terms of the June 2017 merger agreement. Forestar is and will continue to be a publicly-traded 
residential and real estate development company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol 
“FOR,” with operations currently in 14 markets and 10 states, where it owns, directly or through joint ventures, interests 
in 44 residential and mixed-use projects. Our alignment with Forestar advances our strategy of increasing our access to 
high-quality optioned land and lot positions to enhance operational efficiency and returns. Both companies are 
identifying land development opportunities to expand Forestar’s platform, and we plan to acquire a large portion of 
Forestar’s finished lots in accordance with the master supply agreement between the two companies. As the controlling 
shareholder of Forestar, we will have significant influence in guiding the strategic direction and driving the growth and 
operational execution necessary to increase the future value potential of Forestar.

Inventories, Land and Lot Position and Homes in Inventory

We routinely enter into land/lot option contracts to purchase land or developed residential lots at predetermined 

prices on a defined schedule commensurate with planned development or anticipated new home demand. We also 
purchase undeveloped land that generally is vested with the rights to begin development or construction work, and we 
plan and coordinate the development of our land into residential lots for use in our homebuilding business. We manage 
our inventory of owned land and lots and homes under construction relative to demand in each of our markets, including 
starting construction on unsold homes to capture new home demand and actively controlling the number of unsold, 
completed homes in inventory.

Our inventories at September 30, 2017 and 2016 are summarized as follows:

Mortgage Loan Activity

The volume of loans originated by our mortgage operations is directly related to the number of homes closed by 

our homebuilding operations. In fiscal 2017 and 2016, the volume of first-lien loans originated or brokered by DHI 
Mortgage for our homebuyers increased 16% and 17% from the respective prior years, primarily as a result of increases 
in the number of homes closed by our homebuilding operations of 14% and 10%, respectively. The percentages of total 
home closings by our homebuilding operations for which DHI Mortgage handled the homebuyers’ financing were 56%, 
55% and 51% in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These increases also contributed to our higher loan volumes.

Home closings from our homebuilding operations constituted 95%, 93% and 89% of DHI Mortgage loan 

originations in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These rates reflect DHI Mortgage’s consistent focus on the 
captive business provided by our homebuilding operations.

The number of loans sold increased 14% in fiscal 2017 and 16% in fiscal 2016 compared to the respective prior 

years. Virtually all of the mortgage loans held for sale on September 30, 2017 were eligible for sale to Fannie Mae, 
Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae. Approximately 84% of the mortgage loans sold by DHI Mortgage during fiscal 2017 were 
sold to three major financial entities, one of which purchased 45% of the total loans sold.

Financial Services and Other Revenues and Expenses

Revenues from our financial services and other operations increased 18% to $349.5 million in fiscal 2017 from 
$295.6 million in fiscal 2016, while the number of loan originations increased 13% over that same period. Revenues 
from our financial services and other operations increased 12% to $295.6 million in fiscal 2016 from $265.0 million in 
fiscal 2015, and the number of loan originations also increased 12%. In fiscal 2017, revenues increased at a higher rate 
than origination volume primarily due to improved loan sale execution in the secondary market and increased revenue 
from title operations.

Our mortgage operations revenues were reduced by $2.9 million and $8.5 million in fiscal 2017 and 2016, 

respectively, to increase our loss reserves for estimated future recourse obligations and other mortgage loans, and to 
adjust certain mortgage loans held for sale to fair value. Our mortgage operations revenues were increased by $9.8 
million in fiscal 2015 due to reductions in our loss reserves. Our loss reserves for loan recourse obligations are estimated 
based upon analysis of the volume of mortgages originated, loan repurchase requests received, actual repurchases and 
losses through the disposition of such loans or requests and discussions with our mortgage purchasers. Actual losses on 
mortgage loans may differ from our estimates, which may result in future changes to our loss reserves.

General and administrative (G&A) expense related to financial services and other operations was $251.2 million, 
$220.0 million and $183.0 million in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, increasing 14% in 2017 and 20% in 2016 
from the respective prior years. These increases were primarily due to increases in employee related costs due to both 
increased volume and the cost of compliance with mortgage industry regulations. Our financial services and other 
operations employed 1,859, 1,610 and 1,342 employees at September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

As a percentage of financial services and other revenues (excluding the effects of recourse expense or benefit), 

G&A expense was 71.3%, 72.3% and 71.7% in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Fluctuations in financial 
services G&A expense as a percentage of revenues can be expected to occur, as some components of revenue may 
fluctuate differently than loan volumes, and some expenses are not directly related to mortgage loan volume or to 
changes in the amount of revenue earned.

Interest and other income, net of other expense, included in our financial services and other operations consists 

primarily of the interest income of our mortgage subsidiary.

Results of Operations — Consolidated

Income before Income Taxes

Pre-tax income was $1.6 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.1 billion in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The 
increase in our operating income over the three-year period is primarily due to higher revenues from increased home 
closings.

Income Taxes

Our income tax expense was $563.7 million, $467.2 million and $372.7 million in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, 

respectively, and our effective tax rate was 35.2%, 34.5% and 33.2%, respectively, in those years. The effective tax rate 
for all years includes an expense for state income taxes, reduced by tax benefits for the domestic production activities 
deduction and federal energy tax credits. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 also includes a tax benefit for a reduction 
in the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets.

We previously filed three requests for advance consent for a change in tax accounting method with the Internal 

Revenue Service (IRS) relating to changes in the timing of income and expense recognition for tax purposes. We agreed 
to and signed consent agreements for two of the three requests during the quarter ended June 30, 2017. The impact of the 
approved tax accounting method changes was reflected in our consolidated financial statements as of June 30, 2017 as a 
reduction in income taxes payable of $58.2 million, a reduction in the deferred tax asset related to inventory costs of 
$50.1 million, an increase in the deferred tax liability related to the deferral of profit on home sales of $13.4 million and 
income tax expense of $5.3 million. The third request for advance consent for a change in tax accounting method will be 
recognized in the period in which a consent agreement is issued by the IRS and agreed to and signed by us.

At September 30, 2017 and 2016, we had deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, of $376.2 million and 

$486.6 million, respectively, partially offset by valuation allowances of $11.2 million and $10.3 million, respectively. We 
had tax benefits of $26.2 million that exist for state net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards that will expire at various 
times depending on the tax jurisdiction. Of the total amount, $3.8 million of the tax benefits will expire from fiscal years 
2018 to 2022, $2.7 million will expire from fiscal years 2023 to 2027 and $19.7 million will expire from fiscal years 
2028 to 2036. We also had tax benefits for state tax credit carryforwards of $1.4 million that will expire from fiscal years 
2018 to 2019 and $1.1 million of tax benefits for state tax credit carryforwards that have no expiration date. The 
accounting for deferred taxes is based upon estimates of future results. Differences between the anticipated and actual 
outcomes of these future results could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial 
position. Also, changes in existing federal and state tax laws and tax rates could affect future tax results and the valuation 
of our deferred tax assets and liabilities.

When assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some 

portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. The realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the 
generation of sufficient taxable income in future periods. We record a valuation allowance when we determine it is more 
likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The valuation allowance for both years relates 
to our state deferred tax assets for NOL carryforwards. As of September 30, 2017, we believe it is more likely than not 
that a portion of our state NOL carryforwards will not be realized because some state NOL carryforward periods are too 
brief to realize the related deferred tax assets. We will continue to evaluate both the positive and negative evidence in 
determining the need for a valuation allowance with respect to our remaining state NOL carryforwards.

Unrecognized tax benefits are the differences between tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
and the benefits recognized for accounting purposes. We had no unrecognized tax benefits and no accrued interest or 
penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits at September 30, 2017 and 2016.

We are subject to federal income tax and to income tax in multiple states. The statute of limitations for our major 

tax jurisdictions remains open for examination for fiscal years 2014 through 2017. We are currently being audited by 
various states; however, to date, we are not aware of any significant findings identified by the taxing authorities.

Capital Resources and Liquidity

We have historically funded our homebuilding and financial services and other operations with cash flows from 

operating activities, borrowings under bank credit facilities and the issuance of new debt securities. Our current levels of 
cash, borrowing capacity and balance sheet leverage provide us with the operational flexibility to adjust to changes in 
homebuilding market conditions and allow us to increase our investments in homes, finished lots, land and land 
development to expand our operations and grow our profitability.

At September 30, 2017, our ratio of homebuilding debt to total capital (homebuilding notes payable divided by 

total equity plus homebuilding notes payable) was 24.0% compared to 29.2% at September 30, 2016. Over the long term, 
we intend to maintain our ratio of homebuilding debt to total capital below 35%, and we expect it to remain significantly 
lower than 35% throughout fiscal 2018. We believe that the ratio of homebuilding debt to total capital is useful in 
understanding the leverage employed in our homebuilding operations and comparing our capital structure with other 
homebuilders. We exclude the debt of our financial services business because it is separately capitalized, and its 
obligation under its repurchase facility is substantially collateralized and not guaranteed by our parent company or any of 
our homebuilding entities.

We regularly assess our projected capital requirements to fund growth in our business, repay debt obligations, and 

support other general corporate and operational needs, and we regularly evaluate our opportunities to raise additional 
capital. We have an automatically effective universal shelf registration statement filed with the SEC in August 2015, 
registering debt and equity securities that we may issue from time to time in amounts to be determined. As market 
conditions permit, we may issue new debt or equity securities through the public capital markets or obtain additional 
bank financing to fund our projected capital requirements or provide additional liquidity. In October 2017, we used cash 
on hand to purchase 75% of the outstanding shares of Forestar for $558.3 million. We believe that our existing cash 
resources, our revolving credit facility, our mortgage repurchase facility and our ability to access the capital markets will 
provide sufficient liquidity to fund our working capital needs and debt obligations, including the maturity of $400 
million principal amount of senior notes in fiscal 2018.

Capital Resources - Homebuilding

Cash and Cash Equivalents — At September 30, 2017, cash and cash equivalents of our homebuilding segment 

totaled $973.0 million.

Bank Credit Facility — We have a senior unsecured revolving credit facility which was amended in September 

2017 to increase its capacity from $975 million to $1.275 billion and to extend its maturity date to September 25, 2022. 
The uncommitted accordion feature was also amended to permit an increase in the size of the facility to $1.9 billion, 
subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank commitments. The facility also provides for the issuance 
of letters of credit with a sublimit equal to approximately 50% of the revolving credit commitment. Letters of credit 
issued under the facility reduce the available borrowing capacity. The interest rate on borrowings under the revolving 
credit facility may be based on either the Prime Rate or London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus an applicable 
margin, as defined in the credit agreement governing the facility. At September 30, 2017, there were no borrowings 
outstanding and $94.3 million of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility, resulting in available capacity 
of approximately $1.2 billion.

Our revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on our operations and activities, including requiring the 

maintenance of a maximum allowable ratio of debt to tangible net worth and a borrowing base restriction if our ratio of 
debt to tangible net worth exceeds a certain level. These covenants are measured as defined in the credit agreement 
governing the facility and are reported to the lenders quarterly. A failure to comply with these financial covenants could 
allow the lending banks to terminate the availability of funds under the revolving credit facility or cause any outstanding 
borrowings to become due and payable prior to maturity. The credit agreement governing the facility also imposes 
restrictions on the creation of secured debt and liens. At September 30, 2017, we were in compliance with all of the 
covenants, limitations and restrictions of our revolving credit facility.

44

Secured Letter of Credit Agreement — We have a secured letter of credit agreement which requires us to deposit 
cash, in an amount approximating the balance of letters of credit outstanding, as collateral with the issuing bank. The 
amount of cash restricted for letters of credit issued under this agreement totaled $2.5 million and $2.9 million at 
September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and is included in homebuilding restricted cash in our consolidated balance 
sheets.

Public Unsecured Debt — On May 15, 2017, we repaid $350 million principal amount of our 4.75% senior notes, 
which were due on that date. We have $400 million principal amount of senior notes maturing in February 2018 which 
we currently expect to refinance. The indenture governing our senior notes imposes restrictions on the creation of 
secured debt and liens. At September 30, 2017, we were in compliance with all of the limitations and restrictions 
associated with our public debt obligations.

Repurchases of Common Stock — During fiscal 2017, we repurchased 1,850,000 shares of our common stock for 

$60.6 million.

Debt and Equity Repurchase Authorizations — Effective August 1, 2017, our Board of Directors authorized the 
repurchase of up to $500 million of debt securities and $200 million of our common stock effective through July 31, 
2018. The full amount of each of these authorizations was remaining at September 30, 2017.

Capital Resources - Financial Services and Other

Cash and Cash Equivalents — At September 30, 2017, cash and cash equivalents of our financial services and 

other operations totaled $34.8 million.

Mortgage Repurchase Facility — Our mortgage subsidiary, DHI Mortgage, has a mortgage repurchase facility that 

is accounted for as a secured financing. The mortgage repurchase facility provides financing and liquidity to DHI 
Mortgage by facilitating purchase transactions in which DHI Mortgage transfers eligible loans to the counterparties 
against the transfer of funds by the counterparties, thereby becoming purchased loans. DHI Mortgage then has the right 
and obligation to repurchase the purchased loans upon their sale to third-party purchasers in the secondary market or 
within specified time frames from 45 to 60 days in accordance with the terms of the mortgage repurchase facility. In 
February 2017, the mortgage repurchase facility was amended to increase its capacity to $600 million and extend its 
maturity date to February 23, 2018. The capacity of the facility increases, without requiring additional commitments, to 
$725 million for approximately 30 days at each quarter end and to $800 million for approximately 45 days at fiscal year 
end. The capacity can also be increased to $1.0 billion subject to the availability of additional commitments.

As of September 30, 2017, $540.1 million of mortgage loans held for sale with a collateral value of $520.0 million 

were pledged under the mortgage repurchase facility. As a result of advance paydowns totaling $100.0 million, DHI 
Mortgage had an obligation of $420.0 million outstanding under the mortgage repurchase facility at September 30, 2017 
at a 3.3% annual interest rate.

The mortgage repurchase facility is not guaranteed by D.R. Horton, Inc. or any of the subsidiaries that guarantee 

our homebuilding debt. The facility contains financial covenants as to the mortgage subsidiary’s minimum required 
tangible net worth, its maximum allowable ratio of debt to tangible net worth and its minimum required liquidity. These 
covenants are measured and reported to the lenders monthly. At September 30, 2017, DHI Mortgage was in compliance 
with all of the conditions and covenants of the mortgage repurchase facility.

In the past, our mortgage subsidiary has been able to renew or extend its mortgage credit facility at a sufficient 

capacity and on satisfactory terms prior to its maturity, and obtain temporary additional commitments through 
amendments to the credit facility during periods of higher than normal volumes of mortgages held for sale. The liquidity 
of our financial services business depends upon its continued ability to renew and extend the mortgage repurchase 
facility or to obtain other additional financing in sufficient capacities.

Operating Cash Flow Activities

In fiscal 2017, net cash provided by operating activities was $435.1 million compared to $618.0 million in fiscal 

2016. We used $584.4 million of cash to increase our construction in progress and finished home inventory compared to 
$496.2 million in fiscal 2016. In both years, the expenditures were made to support the current year increase in sales and 
closing volumes, as well as the expected increase in the subsequent year. Cash used to increase residential land and lots 
inventory to fund future growth was $362.3 million in fiscal 2017 compared to $10.3 million in fiscal 2016. The most 
significant source of cash provided by operating activities in both years was net income.

Investing Cash Flow Activities

In fiscal 2017, net cash used in investing activities was $171.0 million compared to $112.6 million in fiscal 2016. 
We used $157.3 million and $86.1 million in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively, to purchase and construct property and 
equipment, including office buildings, rental properties, model home furniture and office and technology equipment to 
support our operations. Of the cash used for property and equipment in fiscal 2017, $54.6 million relates to our recent 
efforts to begin developing and constructing multi-family rental properties on land parcels we already owned, and we 
currently have four such projects under active construction. During fiscal 2017, we purchased $8.8 million of debt 
securities which were secured by residential real estate, and in fiscal 2016, we sold a previous investment in debt 
securities for proceeds of $35.8 million. Additionally, we paid $4.1 million during fiscal 2017 to complete our purchase 
of the homebuilding operations of Wilson Parker Homes, acquired in September 2016.

Financing Cash Flow Activities

We expect the short-term financing needs of our operations will be funded with existing cash, cash generated from 
operations and borrowings under our homebuilding and financial services credit facilities. Long-term financing needs for 
the growth of our operations have historically been funded with the issuance of senior unsecured debt securities through 
the public capital markets.

In fiscal 2017, net cash used in financing activities was $559.5 million, consisting primarily of note repayments, 
payments of cash dividends and repurchases of common stock, partially offset by note proceeds. Note repayments of 
$1.2 billion included the repayment of $350 million principal amount of our 4.75% senior notes at maturity and 
repayments of amounts drawn on the revolving credit facility and the mortgage repurchase facility of $835.0 million and 
$53.0 million, respectively. Proceeds from notes payable included draws of $835.0 million on the revolving credit 
facility. During fiscal 2017, we also used cash to repurchase 1,850,000 shares of our common stock for $60.6 million. 
During fiscal 2016, net cash used in financing activities was $586.0 million, consisting primarily of note repayments and 
payments of cash dividends. Note repayments of $549.7 million included the repayment of $170.2 million principal 
amount of our 5.625% senior notes and $372.7 million principal amount of our 6.5% senior notes at maturity.

Our Board of Directors approved and paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.10 per common share and $0.08 per 

common share in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively. In November 2017, our Board of Directors approved a cash 
dividend of $0.125 per common share, payable on December 15, 2017, to stockholders of record on December 1, 2017. 
The declaration of future cash dividends is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon, among other 
things, our future earnings, cash flows, capital requirements, financial condition and general business conditions.

Contractual Cash Obligations, Commercial Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Our primary contractual cash obligations are payments under our debt agreements and lease payments under 

operating leases. We expect to fund our contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business through a combination 
of our existing cash resources, cash flows generated from profits, our homebuilding and financial services credit facilities 
or other bank financing, and the issuance of new debt or equity securities through the public capital markets as market 
conditions may permit.

Our future cash requirements for contractual obligations as of September 30, 2017 are presented below.

_____________

(1)  Homebuilding notes payable represent principal and interest payments due on our senior notes and our secured notes. 

Because the balance of our revolving credit facility was zero at September 30, 2017, we did not assume any principal or 
interest payments related to this facility in future periods.

(2)  Purchase obligations relate to our land and lot option purchase contracts which enable us to control significant lot positions 

with limited capital investment. Among our land and lot option purchase contracts at September 30, 2017, there were a 
limited number of contracts, representing $29.7 million of remaining purchase price, subject to specific performance 
provisions which may require us to purchase the land or lots upon the land sellers meeting their contractual obligations. 
Further information about our land option contracts is provided in the “Inventories, Land and Lot Position and Homes in 
Inventory” section included herein.

(3)  Financial services notes payable represent principal and interest payments due on our mortgage subsidiary’s repurchase 
facility. The interest obligation associated with this variable rate facility is based on its annual effective rate of 3.3% and 
principal balance outstanding at September 30, 2017.

At September 30, 2017, our homebuilding operations had outstanding letters of credit of $96.8 million and surety 

bonds of $1.2 billion, issued by third parties to secure performance under various contracts. We expect that our 
performance obligations secured by these letters of credit and bonds will generally be completed in the ordinary course 
of business and in accordance with the applicable contractual terms. When we complete our performance obligations, the 
related letters of credit and bonds are generally released shortly thereafter, leaving us with no continuing obligations. We 
have no material third-party guarantees.

Our mortgage subsidiary enters into various commitments related to the lending activities of our mortgage 

operations. Further discussion of these commitments is provided in Item 7A “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures 
About Market Risk” under Part II of this annual report on Form 10-K.

47

Seasonality

Although significant changes in market conditions have impacted our seasonal patterns in the past and could do so 
again in the future, we generally close more homes and generate greater revenues and operating income in the third and 
fourth quarters of our fiscal year. The seasonal nature of our business can also cause significant variations in our working 
capital requirements in both our homebuilding and financial services operations. As a result of seasonal activity, our 
quarterly results of operations and financial position at the end of a particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily 
representative of the balance of our fiscal year.

Inflation

We may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation, primarily because of higher financing, land, labor 

and material construction costs. We attempt to pass cost increases through to our customers through increased sales 
prices. However, during periods when housing market conditions are challenging, we may not be able to offset cost 
increases with higher selling prices. In addition, higher mortgage interest rates reduce the affordability of our homes to 
prospective homebuyers.

Critical Accounting Policies

General — A comprehensive enumeration of the significant accounting policies of D.R. Horton, Inc. and 

subsidiaries is presented in Note A to the accompanying financial statements as of September 30, 2017 and 2016, and for 
the years ended September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015. Each of our accounting policies has been chosen based upon 
current authoritative literature that collectively comprises U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). In 
instances where alternative methods of accounting are permissible under GAAP, we have chosen the method that most 
appropriately reflects the nature of our business, the results of our operations and our financial condition, and have 
consistently applied those methods over each of the periods presented in the financial statements. The Audit Committee 
of our Board of Directors has reviewed and approved the accounting policies selected.

Revenue Recognition — We generally recognize homebuilding revenue and related profit at the time of the closing 

of a sale, when title to and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer. In situations where the buyer’s 
financing is originated by DHI Mortgage, our 100% owned mortgage subsidiary, and the buyer has not made an adequate 
initial or continuing investment, the profit is deferred until the sale of the related mortgage loan to a third-party purchaser 
has been completed. Any profit on land sales is deferred until the full accrual method criteria are met. When appropriate, 
revenue and profit on long-term construction projects are recognized under the percentage-of-completion method.

We include proceeds from home closings held for our benefit at title companies in homebuilding cash. When we 

execute sales contracts with our homebuyers, or when we require advance payment from homebuyers for custom 
changes, upgrades or options related to their homes, we record the cash deposits received as liabilities until the homes 
are closed or the contracts are cancelled. We either retain or refund to the homebuyer deposits on cancelled sales 
contracts, depending upon the applicable provisions of the contract or other circumstances.

We recognize financial services revenues associated with our title operations as closing services are rendered and 

title insurance policies are issued, both of which generally occur simultaneously as each home is closed. We transfer 
substantially all underwriting risk associated with title insurance policies to third-party insurers. We typically elect the 
fair value option for our mortgage loan originations. Mortgage loans held for sale are initially recorded at fair value 
based on either sale commitments or current market quotes and are adjusted for subsequent changes in fair value until the 
loans are sold. Net origination costs and fees associated with mortgage loans are recognized at the time of origination. 
The expected net future cash flows related to the associated servicing of a loan are included in the measurement of all 
written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings at the time of commitment. We generally 
sell the mortgages we originate and the related servicing rights to third-party purchasers within 30 days of origination. 
Interest income is earned from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the loan is sold.

Some mortgage loans are sold with limited recourse provisions, which can result in repurchases of loans previously 
sold to investors or payments to reimburse investors for loan losses. Based on historical experience, discussions with our 
mortgage purchasers, analysis of the mortgages we originated and current housing and credit market conditions, we 
estimate and record a loss reserve for mortgage loans held in portfolio and mortgage loans held for sale, as well as 
known and projected mortgage loan repurchase requests.

Inventories and Cost of Sales — Inventory includes the costs of direct land acquisition, land development and 
home construction, capitalized interest, real estate taxes and direct overhead costs incurred during development and 
home construction. Costs that we incur after development projects or homes are substantially complete, such as utilities, 
maintenance, and cleaning, are charged to SG&A expense as incurred. All indirect overhead costs, such as compensation 
of sales personnel, division and region management, and the costs of advertising and builder’s risk insurance are charged 
to SG&A expense as incurred.

50

Land and development costs are typically allocated to individual residential lots on a pro-rata basis, and the costs 
of residential lots are transferred to construction in progress when home construction begins. Home construction costs 
are specifically identified and recorded to individual homes. Cost of sales for homes closed includes the specific 
construction costs of each home and all applicable land acquisition, land development and related costs (both incurred 
and estimated to be incurred) allocated to each residential lot based upon the total number of homes expected to be 
closed in each community. Any changes to the estimated total development costs subsequent to the initial home closings 
in a community are generally allocated on a pro-rata basis to the remaining homes in the community associated with the 
relevant development activity.

When a home is closed, we generally have not paid all incurred costs necessary to complete the home. We record a 
liability and a charge to cost of sales for the amount estimated to ultimately be paid related to completed homes that have 
been closed. We compare our home construction budgets to actual recorded costs to determine the additional costs 
remaining to be paid on each closed home. We monitor the accrual by comparing actual costs incurred on closed homes 
in subsequent months to the amounts previously accrued. Although actual costs to be paid in the future on previously 
closed homes could differ from our current accruals, such differences have not been significant.

Each quarter, we review our communities and land inventories for indicators of potential impairment. We generally 

review our inventory for impairment indicators at the community level, and the inventory within each community is 
categorized as land held for development, residential land and lots developed and under development, land held for sale 
and construction in progress and finished homes, based on the stage of production or plans for future development or 
sale. A particular community often includes inventory in more than one category. In certain situations, inventory may be 
analyzed separately for impairment purposes based on its product type or future plans. In reviewing each of our 
communities, we determine if impairment indicators exist on inventory held and used by analyzing a variety of factors 
including, but not limited to, the following:

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

gross margins on homes closed in recent months;

projected gross margins on homes sold but not closed;

projected gross margins based on community budgets;

trends in gross margins, average selling prices or cost of sales;

sales absorption rates; and

performance of other communities in nearby locations.

If indicators of impairment are present for a community, we perform an impairment evaluation of the community, 
which includes an analysis to determine if the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less 
than their carrying amounts. If so, impairment charges are recorded to cost of sales if the fair value of such assets is less 
than their carrying amounts. These estimates of cash flows are significantly impacted by community specific factors 
including estimates of the amounts and timing of future revenues and estimates of the amount of land development, 
materials and labor costs which, in turn, may be impacted by the following local market conditions:

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

supply and availability of new and existing homes;

location and desirability of our communities;

variety of product types offered in the area;

pricing and use of incentives by us and our competitors;

alternative uses for our land or communities such as the sale of land, finished lots or home sites to third 
parties;

amount of land and lots we own or control in a particular market or sub-market; and

local economic and demographic trends.

51

For those assets deemed to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the 
carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Our determination of fair value is primarily based on 
discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related 
estimated cash flow streams. When an impairment charge for a community is determined, the charge is then allocated to 
each lot in the community in the same manner as land and development costs are allocated to each lot. Impairment 
charges are also recorded on finished homes in substantially completed communities when events or circumstances 
indicate that the carrying values are greater than the fair values less estimated costs to sell these homes.

For the inventory impairment analyses performed during fiscal 2017, we assumed that for the majority of 

communities, sales prices in future periods will be equal to or lower than current sales order prices in each community, or 
in comparable communities, in order to generate an acceptable absorption rate. The remaining lives of the communities 
evaluated were estimated to be in a range from six months to two years, and we utilized a range of discount rates for 
communities from 12% to 18%.

We rarely purchase land for resale. However, when we own land or communities under development that do not fit 
into our development and construction plans, and we determine that we will sell the asset, the project is accounted for as 
land held for sale if certain criteria are met. We record land held for sale at the lesser of its carrying value or fair value 
less estimated costs to sell. In performing the impairment evaluation for land held for sale, we consider several factors 
including, but not limited to, recent offers received to purchase the property, prices for land in recent comparable sales 
transactions and market analysis studies, which include the estimated price a willing buyer would pay for the land. If the 
estimated fair value less costs to sell an asset is less than the current carrying value, the asset is written down to its 
estimated fair value less costs to sell.

The key assumptions relating to inventory valuations are impacted by local market and economic conditions, and 
are inherently uncertain. Although our quarterly assessments reflect management’s best estimates, due to uncertainties in 
the estimation process, actual results could differ from such estimates.

Business Acquisitions — We account for acquisitions of businesses by allocating the purchase price of the business 
to the various assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over 
the estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Significant judgment is often 
required in estimating the fair value of assets acquired, particularly intangible assets. These estimates and assumptions 
are based on historical experience, information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and our 
estimates of significant assumptions that a market participant would use when determining fair value. While we believe 
the estimates and assumptions are reasonable, they are inherently uncertain. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic 
events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions.

Goodwill — We record goodwill associated with our acquisitions of businesses when the purchase price of the 

business exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. We evaluate our goodwill 
balances for potential impairment on at least an annual basis by comparing the carrying value of each of our operating 
segments with goodwill to their estimated fair values. The estimated fair value is determined by discounting the future 
cash flows of the operating segment to their present value. If the carrying value of the operating segment exceeds its fair 
value, we determine if an impairment exists based on the implied fair value of the operating segment’s goodwill. As a 
result of the goodwill evaluation performed in fiscal 2017, no impairment charges were recorded. As a result of the 
goodwill evaluation performed in fiscal 2016, an impairment charge of $7.2 million was recorded to write off the 
remaining goodwill associated with the Huntsville operating segment in the Southeast reporting region. This operating 
segment experienced lower levels of profitability than anticipated primarily due to difficult market conditions. Our total 
goodwill balance was $80.0 million at both September 30, 2017 and 2016.

52

Warranty Claims — We typically provide our homebuyers with a ten-year limited warranty for major defects in 

structural elements such as framing components and foundation systems, a two-year limited warranty on major 
mechanical systems and a one-year limited warranty on other construction components. Since we subcontract our 
construction work to subcontractors who typically provide us with an indemnity and a certificate of insurance prior to 
receiving payments for their work, claims relating to workmanship and materials are generally the primary responsibility 
of the subcontractors. Warranty liabilities have been established by charging cost of sales for each home delivered. The 
amounts charged are based on management’s estimate of expected warranty-related costs under all unexpired warranty 
obligation periods. Our warranty liability is based upon historical warranty cost experience in each market in which we 
operate, and is adjusted to reflect qualitative risks associated with the types of homes we build and the geographic areas 
in which we build them. Actual future warranty costs could differ from our currently estimated amounts. A 10% change 
in the historical warranty rates used to estimate our warranty accrual would not result in a material change in our accrual.

Legal Claims and Insurance — We are named as a defendant in various claims, complaints and other legal actions 

in the ordinary course of business. At any point in time, we are managing several hundred individual claims related to 
construction defect matters, personal injury claims, employment matters, land development issues, contract disputes and 
other matters. We have established reserves for these contingencies based on the estimated costs of pending claims and 
the estimated costs of anticipated future claims related to previously closed homes. Approximately 98% and 95% of 
these reserves related to construction defect matters at September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 

Our reserves for construction defect claims include the estimated costs of both known claims and anticipated future 

claims. At both September 30, 2017 and 2016, we had reserves for approximately 140 pending construction defect 
claims, and no individual existing claim was material to our financial statements. During fiscal 2017, we established 
reserves for approximately 75 new construction defect claims and resolved 75 construction defect claims for a total cost 
of $52.6 million. We have closed a significant number of homes during recent years, and we may be subject to future 
construction defect claims on these homes. Although regulations vary from state to state, construction defect issues can 
generally be reported for up to ten years after the home has closed in many states in which we operate. Historical data 
and trends regarding the frequency of claims incurred and the costs to resolve claims relative to the types of products and 
markets where we operate are used to estimate the construction defect liabilities for both existing and anticipated future 
claims. These estimates are subject to ongoing revision as the circumstances of individual pending claims and historical 
data and trends change. Adjustments to estimated reserves are recorded in the accounting period in which the change in 
estimate occurs.

Historical trends in construction defect claims have been inconsistent, and we believe they may continue to 

fluctuate. Housing market conditions have been volatile across most of our markets over the past ten years, and we 
believe such conditions can affect the frequency and cost of construction defect claims. We closed a significant number 
of homes over the past ten years. If the ultimate resolution of construction defect claims resulting from our home 
closings in prior years varies from current expectations, it could significantly change our estimates regarding the 
frequency and timing of claims incurred and the costs to resolve existing and anticipated future claims, which would 
impact the construction defect reserves in the future. If the frequency of claims incurred or costs of existing and future 
legal claims significantly exceed our current estimates, they will have a significant negative impact on our future 
earnings and liquidity.

We estimate and record receivables under the applicable insurance policies related to our estimated contingencies 
for known claims and anticipated future construction defect claims on previously closed homes and other legal claims 
and lawsuits incurred in the ordinary course of business when recovery is probable. Additionally, we may have the ability 
to recover a portion of our losses from our subcontractors and their insurance carriers when we have been named as an 
additional insured on their insurance policies.

53

The estimation of losses related to these reserves and the related estimates of recoveries from insurance policies are 

subject to a high degree of variability due to uncertainties such as trends in construction defect claims relative to our 
markets and the types of products built, claim frequency, claim settlement costs and patterns, insurance industry practices 
and legal interpretations, among others. Due to the high degree of judgment required in establishing reserves for these 
contingencies, actual future costs and recoveries from insurance could differ significantly from current estimated 
amounts. A 10% increase in the claim frequency and the average cost per claim used to estimate the reserves would 
result in an increase of approximately $71.4 million in our reserves and a $36.1 million increase in our receivable, 
resulting in additional expense of $35.3 million. A 10% decrease in the claim frequency and the average cost per claim 
would result in a decrease of approximately $63.9 million in our reserves and a $28.6 million decrease in our receivable, 
resulting in a reduction in expense of $35.3 million.

Income Taxes — We calculate our income tax expense (benefit) using the asset and liability method, under which 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary 
differences between the financial statement amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and 
attributable to net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. When assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, 
we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The 
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient taxable income in future periods and in 
the jurisdictions in which those temporary differences become deductible. We record a valuation allowance when we 
determine it is more likely than not that a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. The accounting for 
deferred taxes is based upon estimates of future results. Differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these 
future results could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. Also, changes 
in existing federal and state tax laws and tax rates could affect future tax results and the valuation of our deferred tax 
assets.

Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in the financial statements as a 

component of income tax expense. Significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions. We evaluate our 
uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. Our evaluations are based upon a number of factors, including changes in 
facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective 
settlement of audit issues. Changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in increases 
or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change.

Stock-based Compensation — Our stockholders formally authorize shares of our common stock to be available for 

future grants of stock-based compensation awards. From time to time, the Compensation Committee of our Board of 
Directors authorizes the grant of stock-based compensation to our employees and directors from these available shares. 
At September 30, 2017, our outstanding stock-based compensation awards include stock options and restricted stock 
units. Grants of restricted stock units may vest immediately or over a certain number of years as determined by the 
Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors. Restricted stock units outstanding at September 30, 2017 have a 
remaining vesting period of 1 to 5 years. Stock options are granted at exercise prices which equal the market value of our 
common stock at the date of the grant. The stock options outstanding at September 30, 2017 vest over periods of 2 to 
9.75 years from the initial grant date and expire 10 years after the dates on which they were granted.

The compensation expense for stock-based awards is based on the fair value of the award and is recognized on a 

straight-line basis over the remaining vesting period. The fair values of restricted stock units are based on our stock price 
at the date of grant. The fair values of stock options granted are calculated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes 
option pricing model. Determining the fair value of stock options requires judgment in developing assumptions and 
involves a number of estimates. These estimates include, but are not limited to, the expected stock price volatility over 
the term of the awards, the expected dividend yield and expected stock option exercise behavior. In addition, we also use 
judgment in estimating the number of stock options that are expected to be forfeited. The benefits of tax deductions in 
excess of recognized compensation expense are reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows as a financing cash 
flow.

54

Fair Value Measurements — The Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (FASB) authoritative guidance for fair 

value measurements establishes a three-level hierarchy based upon the inputs to the valuation model of an asset or 
liability. The fair value hierarchy and its application to our assets and liabilities, is as follows:

•  Level 1 — Valuation is based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.

•  Level 2 — Valuation is determined from quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted 
prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, or by model-based techniques in which 
all significant inputs are observable in the market.

•  Level 3 — Valuation is typically derived from model-based techniques in which at least one significant input is 
unobservable and based on our own estimates about the assumptions that market participants would use to value 
the asset or liability.

When available, we use quoted market prices in active markets to determine fair value. We consider the principal 
market and nonperformance risk associated with our counterparties when determining the fair value measurements, if 
applicable. Fair value measurements are used for our mortgage loans held for sale, debt securities collateralized by 
residential real estate, interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and other derivative instruments on a recurring basis and 
are used for inventories, certain other mortgage loans, rental properties and real estate owned on a nonrecurring basis, 
when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” which is a 

comprehensive new revenue recognition model that will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance. The core 
principle of this guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services equal to the 
amount that it expects to be entitled to receive for those goods or services. The guidance is effective for us beginning 
October 1, 2018 and allows for full retrospective or modified retrospective methods of adoption. We currently plan to 
adopt this standard using the modified retrospective method and are continuing to evaluate its effect.

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, “Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory,” which simplifies the 

subsequent measurement of inventory, excluding inventory measured using the last-in, first-out or retail inventory 
methods. The guidance specifies that inventory currently measured at the lower of cost or market, where market could be 
determined with different methods, should now be measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The guidance is 
effective for us beginning October 1, 2017 and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial 
position, results of operations or cash flows.

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, “Financial Instruments - Recognition and Measurement of 

Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities,” which addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation 
and disclosure of financial instruments. The guidance is effective for us beginning October 1, 2018 and is not expected to 
have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases,” which requires that lease assets and liabilities be 
recognized on the balance sheet, and that key information about leasing arrangements be disclosed. The guidance is 
effective for us beginning October 1, 2019, although early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact 
of this guidance on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, “Compensation - Stock Compensation,” which simplifies several 
aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of 
awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for us 
beginning October 1, 2017 and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of 
operations or cash flows.

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses,” which replaces the current 

incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration 
of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information in determining credit loss estimates. The guidance is 
effective for us beginning October 1, 2020 and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial 
position, results of operations or cash flows.

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, “Statement of Cash Flows - Classification of Certain Cash 

Receipts and Cash Payments,” which amends and clarifies the current guidance to reduce diversity in practice of the 
classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for us 
beginning October 1, 2018 and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated statements of cash flows.

In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, “Statement of Cash Flows - Restricted Cash,” which requires 

amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents be included with cash and cash equivalents 
when reconciling the total beginning and ending amounts for the periods shown on the statement of cash flows. The 
guidance is effective for us beginning October 1, 2018 and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated 
financial position or cash flows.

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01, “Business Combinations - Clarifying the Definition of a 

Business,” which clarifies the definition of a business for determining whether transactions should be accounted for as 
acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. The guidance is effective for us beginning October 1, 2018 and is not 
expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other.” The guidance simplifies the 
measurement of goodwill impairment by removing the second step of the goodwill impairment test, which requires the 
determination of the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit. Under the new guidance, goodwill 
impairment is measured as the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value with the loss 
recognized limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. The guidance is effective for us 
beginning October 1, 2020 and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of 
operations or cash flows.

In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, “Compensation - Stock Compensation: Scope of Modification 

Accounting,” which clarifies which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity 
to apply modification accounting. Under the new guidance, modification accounting is required if the fair value, vesting 
conditions or classification (equity or liability) of the new award are different from the original award immediately 
before the original award is modified. The guidance is effective for us beginning October 1, 2018 and is not expected to 
have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are subject to interest rate risk on our long-term debt. We monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates and 
utilize both fixed and variable rate debt. For fixed rate debt, changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the 
debt instrument, but not our earnings or cash flows. Conversely, for variable rate debt, changes in interest rates generally 
do not impact the fair value of the debt instrument, but may affect our future earnings and cash flows. Except in very 
limited circumstances, we do not have an obligation to prepay fixed-rate debt prior to maturity and, as a result, interest 
rate risk and changes in fair value would not have a significant impact on our cash flows related to our fixed-rate debt 
until such time as we are required to refinance, repurchase or repay such debt.

We are exposed to interest rate risk associated with our mortgage loan origination services. We manage interest rate 

risk through the use of forward sales of mortgage-backed securities (MBS), which are referred to as “hedging 
instruments” in the following discussion. We do not enter into or hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.

Interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) are extended to borrowers who have applied for loan funding and who 

meet defined credit and underwriting criteria. Typically, the IRLCs have a duration of less than six months. Some IRLCs 
are committed immediately to a specific purchaser through the use of best-efforts whole loan delivery commitments, 
while other IRLCs are funded prior to being committed to third-party purchasers. The hedging instruments related to 
IRLCs are classified and accounted for as derivative instruments in an economic hedge, with gains and losses recognized 
in financial services revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. Hedging instruments related to funded, 
uncommitted loans are accounted for at fair value, with changes recognized in financial services revenues in the 
consolidated statements of operations, along with changes in the fair value of the funded, uncommitted loans. The fair 
value change related to the hedging instruments generally offsets the fair value change in the uncommitted loans. The net 
fair value change, which for the years ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 was not significant, is recognized in current 
earnings. At September 30, 2017, hedging instruments used to mitigate interest rate risk related to uncommitted 
mortgage loans held for sale and uncommitted IRLCs totaled a notional amount of $720.0 million. Uncommitted IRLCs 
totaled a notional amount of approximately $419.3 million and uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale totaled a 
notional amount of approximately $330.7 million at September 30, 2017.

The following table sets forth principal cash flows by scheduled maturity, effective weighted average interest rates 

and estimated fair value of our debt obligations as of September 30, 2017. Because the mortgage repurchase facility is 
effectively secured by certain mortgage loans held for sale which are typically sold within 60 days, its outstanding 
balance is included in the most current period presented. The interest rate for our variable rate debt represents the 
weighted average interest rate in effect at September 30, 2017.

internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations 
and comprehensive income, total equity, yy and cash flows present fairly,yy in all material respects, the financial position 
of D.R. Horton, Inc. and its subsidiaries as of September 30, 2017 and 2016, and the results of their operations and 
their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2017 in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
internal  control  over  financial  reporting  as of  September 30,  2017, based  on criteria 
material  respects, effective 
established in Internal Control rr
- Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for 
of the Treadway 
maintaining effective 
of internal 
control over  financial  reporting,  included  in Management’s Report  on  Internal  Control  over  Financial Reporting
appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We WW conducted our audits in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material 
misstatement and whether effective 
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our  audits of  the  financial  statements included  examining,  on a  test  basis, evidence  supporting  the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial 
reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a 
material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness
of internal control based 
on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We WW believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

ff

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding 
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly 
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely 
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect 
on
the financial statements.

ff

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become 
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE A – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally 
Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and include the accounts of D.R. Horton, Inc. and all of its 100% owned, 
majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries (which are referred to as the Company, unless the context otherwise 
requires). All significant intercompany accounts, transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and 
assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of 
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition

Homebuilding revenue and related profit are generally recognized at the time of the closing of a sale, when title to 
and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer. In situations where the buyer’s financing is originated by DHI 
Mortgage, the Company’s 100% owned mortgage subsidiary, and the buyer has not made an adequate initial or 
continuing investment, the profit is deferred until the sale of the related mortgage loan to a third-party purchaser has been 
completed. At both September 30, 2017 and 2016, the deferred profit on these home sales was $3.6 million. Any profit 
on land sales is deferred until the full accrual method criteria are met. When appropriate, revenue and profit on long-term 
construction projects are recognized under the percentage-of-completion method.

Financial services revenues associated with the Company’s title operations are recognized as closing services are 
rendered and title insurance policies are issued, both of which generally occur simultaneously as each home is closed. 
The Company transfers substantially all underwriting risk associated with title insurance policies to third-party insurers. 
The Company typically elects the fair value option for its mortgage loan originations. Mortgage loans held for sale are 
initially recorded at fair value based on either sale commitments or current market quotes and are adjusted for subsequent 
changes in fair value until the loans are sold. Net origination costs and fees associated with mortgage loans are 
recognized at the time of origination. The expected net future cash flows related to the associated servicing of a loan are 
included in the measurement of all written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings at the 
time of commitment. The Company generally sells the mortgages it originates and the related servicing rights to third-
party purchasers within 30 days of origination. Interest income is earned from the date a mortgage loan is originated until 
the loan is sold.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an initial maturity of three months or less when 

purchased to be cash equivalents. Proceeds from home closings held for the Company’s benefit at title companies are 
included in homebuilding cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheets.

Cash balances of the Company’s captive insurance subsidiary, which are expected to be used to fund the 

subsidiary’s operations and pay future anticipated legal claims, were $36.7 million and $40.5 million at September 30, 
2017 and 2016, respectively, and are included in homebuilding cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated balance 
sheets.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)

Restricted Cash

The Company has cash that is restricted as to its use. Restricted cash related to homebuilding operations includes 

cash used as collateral for outstanding letters of credit issued under the Company’s secured letter of credit agreement and 
customer deposits that are temporarily restricted in accordance with regulatory requirements.

Inventories and Cost of Sales

Inventory includes the costs of direct land acquisition, land development and home construction, capitalized 

interest, real estate taxes and direct overhead costs incurred during development and home construction. Costs incurred 
after development projects or homes are substantially complete, such as utilities, maintenance, and cleaning, are charged 
to selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense as incurred. All indirect overhead costs, such as compensation of 
sales personnel, division and region management, and the costs of advertising and builder’s risk insurance are charged to 
SG&A expense as incurred.

Land and development costs are typically allocated to individual residential lots on a pro-rata basis, and the costs 
of residential lots are transferred to construction in progress when home construction begins. Home construction costs 
are specifically identified and recorded to individual homes. Cost of sales for homes closed includes the specific 
construction costs of each home and all applicable land acquisition, land development and related costs (both incurred 
and estimated to be incurred) allocated to each residential lot based upon the total number of homes expected to be 
closed in each community. Any changes to the estimated total development costs subsequent to the initial home closings 
in a community are generally allocated on a pro-rata basis to the remaining homes in the community associated with the 
relevant development activity.

When a home is closed, the Company generally has not paid all incurred costs necessary to complete the home. A 

liability and a corresponding charge to cost of sales are recorded for the amount estimated to ultimately be paid related to 
completed homes that have been closed. Home construction budgets are compared to actual recorded costs to determine 
the additional costs remaining to be paid on each closed home.

The Company rarely purchases land for resale. However, when the Company owns land or communities under 

development that do not fit into its development and construction plans, and the Company determines that it will sell the 
asset, the project is accounted for as land held for sale if certain criteria are met. The Company records land held for sale 
at the lesser of its carrying value or fair value less estimated costs to sell.

Each quarter, the Company reviews its communities and land inventories for indicators of potential impairment. If 

indicators of impairment are present for a community, the Company performs an impairment evaluation of the 
community, which includes an analysis to determine if the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those 
assets are less than their carrying amounts. If so, impairment charges are recorded to cost of sales if the fair value of such 
assets is less than their carrying amounts. Impairment charges are also recorded on finished homes in substantially 
completed communities when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying values are greater than the fair values 
less estimated costs to sell these homes. The key assumptions relating to inventory valuations are impacted by local 
market and economic conditions and are inherently uncertain. Due to uncertainties in the estimation process, actual 
results could differ from such estimates. See Note C.

Capitalized Interest

The Company capitalizes interest costs incurred to inventory during active development and construction (active 

inventory). Capitalized interest is charged to cost of sales as the related inventory is delivered to the buyer. During 
periods in which the Company’s active inventory is lower than its debt level, a portion of the interest incurred is reflected 
as interest expense in the period incurred. During fiscal 2017 and 2016, the Company’s active inventory exceeded its 
debt level, and all interest incurred was capitalized to inventory. See Note E.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)

Land Option Deposits and Pre-Acquisition Costs

The Company enters into land and lot option purchase contracts to acquire land or lots for the construction of 

homes. Under these contracts, the Company will fund a stated deposit in consideration for the right, but not the 
obligation, to purchase land or lots at a future point in time with predetermined terms. Under the terms of many of the 
option purchase contracts, the option deposits are not refundable in the event the Company elects to terminate the 
contract. Option deposits and capitalized pre-acquisition costs are expensed to inventory and land option charges when 
the Company believes it is probable that it will not acquire the property under option and will not be able to recover these 
costs through other means. See Notes C and K.

Variable Interests

Option purchase contracts can result in the creation of a variable interest in the entity holding the land parcel under 

option. There were no variable interest entities reported in the consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2017 and 
2016 because the Company determined it did not control the activities that most significantly impact the variable interest 
entity’s economic performance, and it did not have an obligation to absorb losses of or the right to receive benefits from 
the entity. The maximum exposure to losses related to the Company’s variable interest entities is limited to the amounts 
of the Company’s related option deposits. At September 30, 2017 and 2016, the option deposits related to these contracts 
totaled $222.9 million and $149.5 million, respectively, and are included in homebuilding other assets in the consolidated 
balance sheets.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Repairs and maintenance costs are 

expensed as incurred. Depreciation generally is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of 
the asset. The depreciable life of model home furniture is 2 years, depreciable lives of office furniture and equipment 
typically range from 2 to 5 years, and depreciable lives of buildings and improvements typically range from 5 to 30 
years.

The Company’s property and equipment balances and the related accumulated depreciation at September 30, 2017 

and 2016 were as follows:

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)

Business Acquisitions

The Company accounts for acquisitions of businesses by allocating the purchase price of the business to the various 
assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated 
fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Significant judgment is often required in 
estimating the fair value of assets acquired, particularly intangible assets. These estimates and assumptions are based on 
historical experience, information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and the Company’s 
estimates of significant assumptions that a market participant would use when determining fair value. While the 
Company believes the estimates and assumptions are reasonable, they are inherently uncertain. Unanticipated market or 
macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and 
assumptions.

In September 2016, the Company acquired the homebuilding operations of Wilson Parker Homes for $91.9 million. 
Wilson Parker Homes operated in Atlanta and Augusta, Georgia; Raleigh, North Carolina; Columbia, South Carolina and 
Phoenix, Arizona. The assets acquired included approximately 380 homes in inventory, 490 lots and control of 
approximately 1,850 additional lots through option contracts. The Company also acquired a sales order backlog of 308 
homes. No goodwill was recorded as a result of this acquisition. All of the assets acquired in this transaction were 
recorded at their estimated fair values by the Company. The acquisition was not material to the Company’s results of 
operations or its financial condition.

In October 2017, the Company acquired 75% of the outstanding shares of Forestar Group Inc. (Forestar) for $558.3 

million in cash, pursuant to the terms of the June 2017 merger agreement. Forestar is and will continue to be a publicly-
traded residential and real estate development company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol 
“FOR.” See Note P.

Goodwill

The Company records goodwill associated with its acquisitions of businesses when the purchase price of the 
business exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Goodwill balances are 
evaluated for potential impairment on at least an annual basis by comparing the carrying value of each of the operating 
segments with goodwill to their estimated fair values. The estimated fair value is determined by discounting the future 
cash flows of the operating segment to their present value. If the carrying value of the operating segment exceeds its fair 
value, the Company determines if an impairment exists based on the implied fair value of the operating segment’s 
goodwill. As a result of the goodwill evaluation performed in fiscal 2017, no impairment charges were recorded. As a 
result of the goodwill evaluation performed in fiscal 2016, an impairment charge of $7.2 million was recorded to write 
off the remaining goodwill in the Huntsville operating segment in the Southeast reporting region. This operating segment 
experienced lower levels of profitability than anticipated primarily due to difficult market conditions. The Company’s 
goodwill balances by reporting segment were as follows:

Warranty Claims

The Company typically provides its homebuyers with a ten-year limited warranty for major defects in structural 

elements such as framing components and foundation systems, a two-year limited warranty on major mechanical systems 
and a one-year limited warranty on other construction components. Since the Company subcontracts its construction 
work to subcontractors who typically provide it with an indemnity and a certificate of insurance prior to receiving 
payments for their work, claims relating to workmanship and materials are generally the primary responsibility of the 
subcontractors. Warranty liabilities have been established by charging cost of sales for each home delivered. The 
amounts charged are based on management’s estimate of expected warranty-related costs under all unexpired warranty 
obligation periods. The Company’s warranty liability is based upon historical warranty cost experience in each market in 
which it operates and is adjusted to reflect qualitative risks associated with the types of homes built and the geographic 
areas in which they are built. See Note K.

Legal Claims and Insurance

The Company records expenses and liabilities for legal claims related to construction defect matters, personal 

injury claims, employment matters, land development issues, contract disputes and other matters. The amounts recorded 
for these contingencies are based on the estimated costs of pending claims and the estimated costs of anticipated future 
claims related to previously closed homes. The Company estimates and records receivables under its applicable 
insurance policies for these legal claims when recovery is probable. Additionally, the Company may have the ability to 
recover a portion of its losses from its subcontractors and their insurance carriers when the Company has been named as 
an additional insured on their insurance policies. See Note K.

Advertising Costs

The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising expense was approximately $45.4 million, $41.2 

million and $42.4 million in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Income Taxes

The Company’s income tax expense is calculated using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax 
assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between 
the financial statement amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and attributable to net operating 
losses and tax credit carryforwards. When assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers 
whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized. The realization of 
deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient taxable income in future periods and in the jurisdictions 
in which those temporary differences become deductible. The Company records a valuation allowance when it 
determines it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The accounting for 
deferred taxes is based upon estimates of future results. Differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these 
future results could have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial position. 
Also, changes in existing federal and state tax laws and tax rates could affect future tax results and the valuation of the 
Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities.

Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in the financial statements as a 

component of income tax expense. Significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions. The Company 
evaluates its uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. The evaluations are based upon a number of factors, including 
changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and 
effective settlement of audit issues. Changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in 
increases or decreases in the Company’s income tax expense in the period in which the change is made. See Note G.

D.R. HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during 
each year. Diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock and dilutive 
securities outstanding during each year. See Note H.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company’s stockholders formally authorize shares of its common stock to be available for future grants of 

stock-based compensation awards. From time to time, the Compensation Committee of the Company’s Board of 
Directors authorizes the grant of stock-based compensation to its employees and directors from these available shares. At 
September 30, 2017, the outstanding stock-based compensation awards include stock options and restricted stock units. 
Grants of restricted stock units may vest immediately or over a certain number of years as determined by the 
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Restricted stock units outstanding at September 30, 2017 have a 
remaining vesting period of 1 to 5 years. Stock options are granted at exercise prices which equal the market value of the 
Company’s common stock at the date of the grant. The stock options outstanding at September 30, 2017 vest over 
periods of 2 to 9.75 years from the initial grant date and expire 10 years after the dates on which they were granted.

The compensation expense for stock-based awards is based on the fair value of the award and is recognized on a 

straight-line basis over the remaining vesting period. The fair values of restricted stock units are based on the Company’s 
stock price at the date of grant. The fair values of stock options granted are calculated on the date of grant using a Black-
Scholes option pricing model. Determining the fair value of stock options requires judgment in developing assumptions 
and involves a number of estimates. These estimates include, but are not limited to, the expected stock price volatility 
over the term of the awards, the expected dividend yield and expected stock option exercise behavior. In addition, 
judgment is used in estimating the number of stock options that are expected to be forfeited. The benefits of tax 
deductions in excess of recognized compensation expense are reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows as a 
financing cash flow. See Note J.

Fair Value Measurements

The Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (FASB) authoritative guidance for fair value measurements 

establishes a three-level hierarchy based upon the inputs to the valuation model of an asset or liability. When available, 
the Company uses quoted market prices in active markets to determine fair value. The Company considers the principal 
market and nonperformance risk associated with the Company’s counterparties when determining the fair value 
measurements, if applicable. Fair value measurements are used for the Company’s mortgage loans held for sale, debt 
securities collateralized by residential real estate, interest rate lock commitments and other derivative instruments on a 
recurring basis and are used for inventories, certain other mortgage loans, rental properties and real estate owned on a 
nonrecurring basis, when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. See Note M.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” which is a 

comprehensive new revenue recognition model that will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance. The core 
principle of this guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services equal to the 
amount that it expects to be entitled to receive for those goods or services. The guidance is effective for the Company 
beginning October 1, 2018 and allows for full retrospective or modified retrospective methods of adoption. The 
Company currently plans to adopt this standard using the modified retrospective method and is continuing to evaluate its 
effect.

68

D.R. HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, “Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory,” which simplifies the 

subsequent measurement of inventory, excluding inventory measured using the last-in, first-out or retail inventory 
methods. The guidance specifies that inventory currently measured at the lower of cost or market, where market could be 
determined with different methods, should now be measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The guidance is 
effective for the Company beginning October 1, 2017 and is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated 
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, “Financial Instruments - Recognition and Measurement of 

Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities,” which addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation 
and disclosure of financial instruments. The guidance is effective for the Company beginning October 1, 2018 and is not 
expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases,” which requires that lease assets and liabilities be 
recognized on the balance sheet, and that key information about leasing arrangements be disclosed. The guidance is 
effective for the Company beginning October 1, 2019, although early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently 
evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, “Compensation - Stock Compensation,” which simplifies several 
aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of 
awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for the 
Company beginning October 1, 2017 and is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, 
results of operations or cash flows.

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses,” which replaces the current 

incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration 
of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information in determining credit loss estimates. The guidance is 
effective for the Company beginning October 1, 2020 and is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated 
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, “Statement of Cash Flows - Classification of Certain Cash 

Receipts and Cash Payments,” which amends and clarifies the current guidance to reduce diversity in practice of the 
classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for the 
Company beginning October 1, 2018 and is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated statements of cash 
flows.

In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, “Statement of Cash Flows - Restricted Cash,” which requires 

amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents be included with cash and cash equivalents 
when reconciling the total beginning and ending amounts for the periods shown on the statement of cash flows. The 
guidance is effective for the Company beginning October 1, 2018 and is not expected to have a material impact on its 
consolidated financial position or cash flows.

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01, “Business Combinations - Clarifying the Definition of a 

Business,” which clarifies the definition of a business for determining whether transactions should be accounted for as 
acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. The guidance is effective for the Company beginning October 1, 2018 
and is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other.” The guidance simplifies the 
measurement of goodwill impairment by removing the second step of the goodwill impairment test, which requires the 
determination of the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit. Under the new guidance, goodwill 
impairment is measured as the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value with the loss 
recognized limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. The guidance is effective for the 
Company beginning October 1, 2020 and is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, 
results of operations or cash flows.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)

In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, “Compensation - Stock Compensation: Scope of Modification 

Accounting,” which clarifies which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity 
to apply modification accounting. Under the new guidance, modification accounting is required if the fair value, vesting 
conditions or classification (equity or liability) of the new award are different from the original award immediately 
before the original award is modified. The guidance is effective for the Company beginning October 1, 2018 and is not 
expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

NOTE B – SEGMENT INFORMATION

The Company’s operating segments are its 41 homebuilding divisions, its financial services operations and its 
other business activities. The homebuilding operating segments are aggregated into six reporting segments and the 
financial services segment is its own reporting segment. The Company’s reportable homebuilding segments are: East, 
Midwest, Southeast, South Central, Southwest and West. These reporting segments have homebuilding operations 
located in the following states:

East:

Midwest:

Southeast:

Delaware, Georgia (Savannah only), Maryland, New Jersey, North Carolina, Pennsylvania,
South Carolina and Virginia

Colorado, Illinois and Minnesota

Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi and Tennessee

South Central:

Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas

Southwest:

Arizona and New Mexico

West:

California, Hawaii, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Washington

Homebuilding is the Company’s core business, generating 98% of consolidated revenues in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 
2015. The Company’s homebuilding segments are primarily engaged in the acquisition and development of land and the 
construction and sale of residential homes in 26 states and 79 markets across the United States. The homebuilding 
segments generate most of their revenues from the sale of completed homes and to a lesser extent from the sale of land 
and lots.

The Company’s financial services segment provides mortgage financing and title agency services to homebuyers in 

many of the Company’s homebuilding markets. The segment generates the substantial majority of its revenues from 
originating and selling mortgages and collecting fees for title insurance agency and closing services. The Company sells 
substantially all of the mortgages it originates and the related servicing rights to third-party purchasers.

In addition to its core homebuilding and financial services operations, the Company has subsidiaries that engage in 
other business activities. These subsidiaries conduct insurance-related operations, construct and own income-producing 
rental properties, own non-residential real estate including ranch land and improvements and own and operate oil and gas 
related assets. The operating results of these subsidiaries are immaterial for separate reporting and therefore are grouped 
together and presented as other. One of these subsidiaries, DHI Communities, recently began developing and 
constructing multi-family rental properties on land parcels the Company already owned and currently has four projects 
under active construction. Costs incurred by DHI Communities totaled $93.7 million at September 30, 2017 and are 
included in property and equipment in the Financial Services and Other section of the consolidated balance sheet. The 
combined assets of all of the Company’s subsidiaries engaged in other business activities totaled $143.3 million and 
$54.9 million at September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and the combined pre-tax loss of these subsidiaries was 
$11.7 million, $9.0 million and $0 in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

NOTE C – INVENTORY

At the end of each quarter during fiscal 2017, the Company reviewed the performance and outlook for all of its 

communities and land inventories for indicators of potential impairment and performed detailed impairment evaluations 
and analyses when necessary. As of September 30, 2017, the Company performed detailed impairment evaluations of 
communities and land inventories with a combined carrying value of $105.3 million and recorded impairment charges of 
$12.8 million during the fourth quarter to reduce the carrying value of impaired communities and land to their estimated 
fair value. Total impairment charges during fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $23.2 million, $20.3 million and $44.9 
million, respectively.

During fiscal 2017, the Company wrote off $17.0 million of earnest money deposits and pre-acquisition costs 

related to land option contracts that the Company has terminated or expects to terminate. Earnest money and pre-
acquisition cost write-offs for fiscal 2016 and 2015 were $11.1 million and $15.4 million, respectively.

Debt issuance costs that were deducted from the carrying amounts of the senior notes totaled $9.5 million and 

$13.3 million at September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. These costs are capitalized into inventory as they are 
amortized.

As of September 30, 2017, maturities of consolidated notes payable, assuming the mortgage repurchase facility is 
not extended or renewed, are $829.6 million in fiscal 2018, $500.8 million in fiscal 2019, $500.7 million in fiscal 2020, 
none in fiscal 2021, $350.0 million in fiscal 2022 and $700.0 million thereafter.

Homebuilding:

The Company has a senior unsecured revolving credit facility which was amended in September 2017 to increase 
its capacity from $975 million to $1.275 billion and to extend its maturity date to September 25, 2022. The uncommitted 
accordion feature was also amended to permit an increase in the size of the facility to $1.9 billion, subject to certain 
conditions and availability of additional bank commitments. The facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit 
with a sublimit equal to approximately 50% of the revolving credit commitment. Letters of credit issued under the 
facility reduce the available borrowing capacity. The interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility may 
be based on either the Prime Rate or London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus an applicable margin, as defined in 
the credit agreement governing the facility. Borrowings and repayments under the facility were $835 million during 
fiscal 2017. At September 30, 2017, there were no borrowings outstanding and $94.3 million of letters of credit issued 
under the revolving credit facility.

D.R. HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)

The Company’s revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on its operations and activities, including requiring 

the maintenance of a maximum allowable ratio of debt to tangible net worth and a borrowing base restriction if the 
Company’s ratio of debt to tangible net worth exceeds a certain level. These covenants are measured as defined in the 
credit agreement governing the facility and are reported to the lenders quarterly. A failure to comply with these financial 
covenants could allow the lending banks to terminate the availability of funds under the revolving credit facility or cause 
any outstanding borrowings to become due and payable prior to maturity. The credit agreement governing the facility 
and the indenture governing the senior notes also impose restrictions on the creation of secured debt and liens. At 
September 30, 2017, the Company was in compliance with all of the covenants, limitations and restrictions of its 
revolving credit facility and public debt obligations.

The Company has an automatically effective universal shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission (SEC) in August 2015, registering debt and equity securities that the Company may issue from 
time to time in amounts to be determined.

On May 15, 2017, the Company repaid $350 million principal amount of its 4.75% senior notes, which were due 

on that date.

The key terms of the Company’s senior notes outstanding as of September 30, 2017 are summarized below.

(2)  Interest is payable semi-annually on each of the series of senior notes. The annual effective interest rate is calculated 

after giving effect to the amortization of debt issuance costs.

All series of senior notes and borrowings under the revolving credit facility are senior obligations and rank pari 

passu in right of payment to all existing and future unsecured indebtedness and senior to all existing and future 
indebtedness expressly subordinated to them. The senior notes and borrowings under the revolving credit facility are 
guaranteed by entities that hold approximately 92% of the Company’s assets. Upon the occurrence of both a change of 
control of the Company and a ratings downgrade event, as defined in the indenture governing its senior notes, the 
Company would be required in certain circumstances to offer to repurchase these notes at 101% of their principal 
amount, along with accrued and unpaid interest. Also, a change of control as defined in the revolving credit facility 
would constitute an event of default under the revolving credit facility, which could result in the acceleration of any 
borrowings outstanding under the facility and the termination of the commitments thereunder.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)

Effective August 1, 2017, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $500 million of the Company’s 

debt securities effective through July 31, 2018. All of the $500 million authorization was remaining at September 30, 
2017.

Financial Services:

The Company’s mortgage subsidiary, DHI Mortgage, has a mortgage repurchase facility that is accounted for as a 

secured financing. The mortgage repurchase facility provides financing and liquidity to DHI Mortgage by facilitating 
purchase transactions in which DHI Mortgage transfers eligible loans to the counterparties against the transfer of funds 
by the counterparties, thereby becoming purchased loans. DHI Mortgage then has the right and obligation to repurchase 
the purchased loans upon their sale to third-party purchasers in the secondary market or within specified time frames 
from 45 to 60 days in accordance with the terms of the mortgage repurchase facility. In February 2017, the mortgage 
repurchase facility was amended to increase its capacity to $600 million and extend its maturity date to February 23, 
2018. The capacity of the facility increases, without requiring additional commitments, to $725 million for 
approximately 30 days at each quarter end and to $800 million for approximately 45 days at fiscal year end. The capacity 
can also be increased to $1.0 billion subject to the availability of additional commitments.

As of September 30, 2017, $540.1 million of mortgage loans held for sale with a collateral value of $520.0 million 

were pledged under the mortgage repurchase facility. As a result of advance paydowns totaling $100.0 million, DHI 
Mortgage had an obligation of $420.0 million outstanding under the mortgage repurchase facility at September 30, 2017 
at a 3.3% annual interest rate.

The mortgage repurchase facility is not guaranteed by D.R. Horton, Inc. or any of the subsidiaries that guarantee 
the Company’s homebuilding debt. The facility contains financial covenants as to the mortgage subsidiary’s minimum 
required tangible net worth, its maximum allowable ratio of debt to tangible net worth and its minimum required 
liquidity. These covenants are measured and reported to the lenders monthly. At September 30, 2017, DHI Mortgage was 
in compliance with all of the conditions and covenants of the mortgage repurchase facility.

In the past, DHI Mortgage has been able to renew or extend its mortgage credit facility at a sufficient capacity and 

on satisfactory terms prior to its maturity and obtain temporary additional commitments through amendments to the 
credit facility during periods of higher than normal volumes of mortgages held for sale. The liquidity of the Company’s 
financial services business depends upon its continued ability to renew and extend the mortgage repurchase facility or to 
obtain other additional financing in sufficient capacities.

NOTE F – MORTGAGE LOANS

Mortgage Loans Held for Sale

Mortgage loans held for sale consist primarily of single-family residential loans collateralized by the underlying 

property. At September 30, 2017, mortgage loans held for sale had an aggregate carrying value of $587.3 million and an 
aggregate outstanding principal balance of $570.8 million. At September 30, 2016, mortgage loans held for sale had an 
aggregate carrying value of $654.0 million and an aggregate outstanding principal balance of $631.8 million. During the 
years ended September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, mortgage loans originated totaled $6.8 billion, $5.9 billion and $5.1 
billion, respectively, and mortgage loans sold totaled $6.8 billion, $5.9 billion and $5.0 billion, respectively. The 
Company had gains on sales of loans and servicing rights of $251.1 million, $207.5 million and $182.8 million during 
the years ended September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Net gains on sales of loans and servicing rights are 
included in financial services revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. Approximately 84% of the mortgage 
loans sold by DHI Mortgage during fiscal 2017 were sold to three major financial entities, one of which purchased 45% 
of the total loans sold.

To manage the interest rate risk inherent in its mortgage operations, the Company hedges its risk using derivative 

instruments, generally forward sales of mortgage-backed securities (MBS), which are referred to as “hedging 
instruments” in the following discussion. The Company does not enter into or hold derivatives for trading or speculative 
purposes.

Newly originated loans that have been closed but not committed to third-party purchasers are hedged to mitigate 
the risk of changes in their fair value. Hedged loans are committed to third-party purchasers typically within three days 
after origination. The notional amounts of the hedging instruments used to hedge mortgage loans held for sale vary in 
relationship to the underlying loan amounts, depending on the movements in the value of each hedging instrument 
relative to the value of the underlying mortgage loans. The fair value change related to the hedging instruments generally 
offsets the fair value change in the mortgage loans held for sale. The net fair value change, which for the years ended 
September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was not significant, is recognized in financial services revenues in the consolidated 
statements of operations. At September 30, 2017 and 2016, the Company’s mortgage loans held for sale that were not 
committed to third-party purchasers totaled $330.7 million and $284.5 million, respectively, and the notional amounts of 
the hedging instruments related to those loans totaled $330.7 million and $284.5 million, respectively.

Other Mortgage Loans and Loss Reserves

Mortgage loans are sold with limited recourse provisions derived from industry-standard representations and 

warranties in the relevant agreements. These representations and warranties primarily involve the absence of 
misrepresentations by the borrower or other parties, the appropriate underwriting of the loan and in some cases, a 
required minimum number of payments to be made by the borrower. The Company generally does not retain any other 
continuing interest related to mortgage loans sold in the secondary market. The majority of other mortgage loans consists 
of loans repurchased due to these limited recourse obligations. Typically, these loans are impaired and some become real 
estate owned through the foreclosure process. At September 30, 2017 and 2016, the Company’s total other mortgage 
loans and real estate owned, before loss reserves, were as follows:

The Company has recorded reserves for estimated losses on other mortgage loans, real estate owned and future 
loan repurchase obligations due to the limited recourse provisions, all of which are recorded as reductions of financial 
services revenue. The loss reserve for loan repurchase and settlement obligations is estimated based on analysis of the 
volume of mortgages originated, loan repurchase requests received, actual repurchases and losses through the disposition 
of such loans or requests and discussions with mortgage purchasers. The reserve balances at September 30, 2017 and 
2016 were as follows:

and Other section of the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.

Loan Commitments and Related Derivatives

The Company is party to interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs), which are extended to borrowers who have 

applied for loan funding and meet defined credit and underwriting criteria. At September 30, 2017 and 2016, the notional 
amount of IRLCs, which are accounted for as derivative instruments recorded at fair value, totaled $446.2 million and 
$467.6 million, respectively.

The Company manages interest rate risk related to its IRLCs through the use of best-efforts whole loan delivery 

commitments and hedging instruments. These instruments are considered derivatives in an economic hedge and are 
accounted for at fair value with gains and losses recognized in financial services revenues in the consolidated statements 
of operations. At September 30, 2017 and 2016, the notional amount of best-efforts whole loan delivery commitments 
totaled $26.9 million and $37.2 million, respectively, and the notional amount of hedging instruments related to IRLCs 
not yet committed to purchasers totaled $389.3 million and $385.5 million, respectively.

The Company’s effective tax rate was 35.2%, 34.5% and 33.2% in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The 

effective tax rate for all years includes an expense for state income taxes, reduced by tax benefits for the domestic 
production activities deduction and federal energy tax credits. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 also includes a tax 
benefit for a reduction in the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets.

The Company previously filed three requests for advance consent for a change in tax accounting method with the 

Internal Revenue Service (IRS) relating to changes in the timing of income and expense recognition for tax purposes. 
The Company agreed to and signed consent agreements for two of the three requests during the quarter ended June 30, 
2017. The impact of the approved tax accounting method changes was reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
as of June 30, 2017 as a reduction in income taxes payable of $58.2 million, a reduction in the deferred tax asset related 
to inventory costs of $50.1 million, an increase in the deferred tax liability related to the deferral of profit on home sales 
of $13.4 million and income tax expense of $5.3 million. The third request for advance consent for a change in tax 
accounting method will be recognized in the period in which a consent agreement is issued by the IRS and agreed to and 
signed by the Company.

2037. Tax benefits for state tax credit carryforwards of $1.4 million will expire from fiscal years 2018 to 2019 and $1.1 
million of tax benefits for state tax credit carryforwards have no expiration date.

The accounting for deferred taxes is based upon estimates of future results. Differences between the anticipated and 
actual outcomes of these future results could have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations 
or financial position. Also, changes in existing federal and state tax laws and tax rates could affect future tax results and 
the valuation of the Company’s deferred tax assets.

Valuation Allowance

When assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not 
that some portion or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized. The realization of deferred tax assets is dependent 
upon the generation of sufficient taxable income in future periods. The Company records a valuation allowance when it 
determines it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The valuation allowance 
for both years relates to the Company’s state deferred tax assets for NOL carryforwards. As of September 30, 2017, the 
Company believes it is more likely than not that a portion of its state NOL carryforwards will not be realized because 
some state NOL carryforward periods are too brief to realize the related deferred tax assets. The Company will continue 
to evaluate both the positive and negative evidence in determining the need for a valuation allowance with respect to its 
remaining state NOL carryforwards.

Unrecognized Tax Benefits

Unrecognized tax benefits are the differences between tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
and the benefits recognized for accounting purposes. The Company had no unrecognized tax benefits and no accrued 
interest or penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits at September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015. The Company classifies 
interest expense and penalties on income taxes as income tax expense.

Regulations and Legislation

The Company is subject to federal income tax and to income tax in multiple states. The statute of limitations for 
the Company’s major tax jurisdictions remains open for examination for fiscal years 2014 through 2017. The Company 
is currently being audited by various states; however, to date, management is not aware of any significant findings 
identified by the taxing authorities.

NOTE I – STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY

The Company has an automatically effective universal shelf registration statement, filed with the SEC in August 

2015, registering debt and equity securities that it may issue from time to time in amounts to be determined. At 
September 30, 2017, the Company had 384,036,150 shares of common stock issued and 374,986,079 shares outstanding. 
No shares of preferred stock were issued or outstanding.

During fiscal 2017, the Company repurchased 1,850,000 shares of its common stock for $60.6 million. Effective 

August 1, 2017, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $200 million of the Company’s common stock 
effective through July 31, 2018, which replaced the previous authorization. All of the $200 million authorization was 
remaining at September 30, 2017, and no common stock has been repurchased subsequent to September 30, 2017.

The Board of Directors approved and paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.10 per common share and $0.08 per 

common share in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively. In November 2017, the Board of Directors approved a cash 
dividend of $0.125 per common share, payable on December 15, 2017, to stockholders of record on December 1, 2017.

NOTE J – EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

Deferred Compensation Plans

The Company has a 401(k) plan for all employees who have been with the Company for a period of six months or 
more. The Company matches portions of employees’ voluntary contributions. Additional employer contributions in the 
form of profit sharing may also be made at the Company’s discretion. The Company recorded $16.0 million, $13.3 
million and $10.8 million of expense for matching contributions in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

The Company’s Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) is a non-qualified deferred compensation 
program that provides benefits payable to certain management employees upon retirement, death or termination of 
employment. Under the SERP, the Company accrues an unfunded benefit based on a percentage of the eligible 
employees’ salaries, as well as an interest factor based upon a predetermined formula. The Company’s liabilities related 
to the SERP were $31.6 million and $28.3 million at September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company recorded 
$4.9 million, $4.6 million and $4.4 million of expense for this plan in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

The Company has a deferred compensation plan available to a select group of employees which allows 

participating employees to contribute compensation into the plan on a before tax basis and defer income taxation on the 
contributions until the funds are withdrawn from the plan. The participating employees designate investments for their 
contributions; however, the Company is not required to invest the contributions in the designated investments. The 
Company’s net liabilities related to the deferred compensation plan were $58.2 million and $46.7 million at 
September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company records as expense the amount that the employee 
contributions would have earned had the funds been invested in the designated investments. Related to this plan, the 
Company recorded expense of $6.3 million and $4.0 million in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively, and a reduction in 
expense of $1.7 million in fiscal 2015.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan provides eligible employees the opportunity to purchase common 

stock of the Company at a discounted price of 85% of the fair market value of the stock on the designated dates of 
purchase. The price to eligible employees may be further discounted depending on the average fair market value of the 
stock during the period and certain other criteria. Under the terms of the plan, the total fair market value of common 
stock that an eligible employee may purchase each year is limited to the lesser of 15% of the employee’s annual 
compensation or $25,000. Under the plan, employees purchased 111,527 shares for $2.8 million in fiscal 2017, 
89,652 shares for $2.2 million in fiscal 2016 and 82,446 shares for $1.7 million in fiscal 2015. At September 30, 2017, 
the Company had 3.2 million shares of common stock reserved for issuance pursuant to the Employee Stock Purchase 
Plan.

Incentive Bonus Plan

The Company’s Incentive Bonus Plan provides for the Compensation Committee to award short-term performance 

bonuses to senior management based upon the level of achievement of certain criteria. For fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, 
the Compensation Committee approved awards whereby certain executive officers could earn performance bonuses 
based upon percentages of the Company’s pre-tax income. Compensation expense related to these plans was $16.8 
million, $14.2 million and $11.8 million in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company’s Stock Incentive Plan provides for the granting of stock options and restricted stock units to 

executive officers, other key employees and non-management directors. Restricted stock unit awards may be based on 
performance (performance-based) or on service over a requisite time period (time-based).

At September 30, 2017, the Company had 31.8 million shares of common stock reserved for issuance and 19.0 
million shares available for future grants under the Stock Incentive Plan. The discussion that follows provides further 
information regarding stock-based compensation granted during fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015. 

Stock Options

Stock options are granted at exercise prices which equal the market value of the Company’s common stock at the 

date of the grant. The options outstanding at September 30, 2017 vest over periods of 2 to 9.75 years from the initial 
grant date and expire 10 years after the dates on which they were granted.

The Company did not grant stock options during fiscal 2017, 2016 or 2015, however the following table provides

The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised during fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $49.5 million, $39.2 

million and $44.6 million, respectively. The intrinsic value of a stock option is the amount by which the market value of 
the underlying stock exceeds the option exercise price.

The aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding and exercisable at September 30, 2017 was $194.0 million and 
$138.0 million, respectively. Exercise prices for options outstanding at September 30, 2017 ranged from $9.03 to $23.86. 
The weighted average remaining contractual lives of options outstanding and exercisable at September 30, 2017 were 4.0 
and 3.9 years, respectively.

For fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, compensation expense related to stock options was $15.1 million, $20.5 million 
and $28.9 million, respectively. At September 30, 2017, there was $9.0 million of unrecognized compensation expense 
related to unvested stock option awards. This expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.3 
years.

Performance-Based Restricted Stock Unit (RSU) Equity Awards

During fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, performance-based RSU equity awards that vest at the end of three-year 
performance periods were granted to the Company’s Chairman, its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Operating 
Officer. The number of units that ultimately vest depends on the Company’s relative position as compared to its peers in 
achieving certain performance criteria and can range from 0% to 200% of the number of units granted. The performance 
criteria are total shareholder return, return on investment, SG&A expense containment and gross profit. The 
performance-based RSUs have no dividend or voting rights during the performance period. Each of these performance-
based RSUs represents the contingent right to receive one share of the Company’s common stock if the vesting 
conditions are satisfied. Compensation expense related to these grants is based on the Company’s performance against 
the peer group, the elapsed portion of the performance period and the grant date fair value of the award.

Time-Based Restricted Stock Unit (RSU) Equity Awards

Time-based RSUs represent the contingent right to receive one share of the Company’s common stock if the 
vesting conditions are satisfied. The time-based RSUs have no dividend or voting rights during the vesting period.

During fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, time-based RSUs were granted to the Company’s executive officers, other key 
employees and non-management directors (collectively, approximately 600, 570 and 580 recipients, respectively). These 
awards vest annually in equal installments over periods of three to five years. RSUs generally result in less dilution to 
shareholders than stock options, which have been granted to key employees in the past. RSUs also provide an immediate, 
tangible value to the recipient and better diversification than stock options alone, which promotes the retention of key 
employees over the multi-year vesting period. 

The following table provides additional information related to time-based RSU activity during fiscal 2017, 2016

NOTE K – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Warranty Claims

The Company provides its homebuyers with warranties for defects in structural components, mechanical systems 

and other construction components of the home. Warranty liabilities are established by charging cost of sales for each 
home delivered based on management’s estimate of expected warranty-related costs and by accruing for existing 
warranty claims. The Company’s warranty liability is based upon historical warranty cost experience in each market in 
which it operates and is adjusted to reflect qualitative risks associated with the types of homes built and the geographic 
areas in which they are built. The estimation of these costs is subject to a high degree of variability due to uncertainties 
related to these factors. Due to the high degree of judgment required in establishing the liability for warranty claims, 
actual future costs could differ significantly from current estimated amounts, and it is not possible for the Company to 
make a reasonable estimate of the possible loss or range of loss in excess of its warranty liability.

Changes in the Company’s warranty liability during fiscal 2017 and 2016 were as follows:

Legal Claims and Insurance

The Company is named as a defendant in various claims, complaints and other legal actions in the ordinary course 

of business. At any point in time, the Company is managing several hundred individual claims related to construction 
defect matters, personal injury claims, employment matters, land development issues, contract disputes and other 
matters. The Company has established reserves for these contingencies based on the estimated costs of pending claims 
and the estimated costs of anticipated future claims related to previously closed homes. The estimated liabilities for these 
contingencies were $420.6 million and $423.5 million at September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and are included in 
homebuilding accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Approximately 98% and 95% of 
these reserves related to construction defect matters at September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Expenses related to 
the Company’s legal contingencies were $87.8 million, $49.6 million and $43.4 million in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, 
respectively.

The Company’s reserves for construction defect claims include the estimated costs of both known claims and 

anticipated future claims. As of September 30, 2017, no individual existing claim was material to the Company’s 
financial statements. The Company has closed a significant number of homes during recent years and may be subject to 
future construction defect claims on these homes. Although regulations vary from state to state, construction defect 
issues can generally be reported for up to ten years after the home has closed in many states in which the Company 
operates. Historical data and trends regarding the frequency of claims incurred and the costs to resolve claims relative to 
the types of products and markets where the Company operates are used to estimate the construction defect liabilities for 
both existing and anticipated future claims. These estimates are subject to ongoing revision as the circumstances of 
individual pending claims and historical data and trends change. Adjustments to estimated reserves are recorded in the 
accounting period in which the change in estimate occurs.

85

D.R. HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)

Historical trends in construction defect claims have been inconsistent, and the Company believes they may 

continue to fluctuate. Housing market conditions have been volatile across most of the Company’s markets over the past 
ten years, and the Company believes such conditions can affect the frequency and cost of construction defect claims. If 
the ultimate resolution of construction defect claims resulting from the Company’s home closings in prior years varies 
from current expectations, it could significantly change the Company’s estimates regarding the frequency and timing of 
claims incurred and the costs to resolve existing and anticipated future claims, which would impact the construction 
defect reserves in the future. If the frequency of claims incurred or costs of existing and future legal claims significantly 
exceed the Company’s current estimates, they will have a significant negative impact on its future earnings and liquidity.

The Company’s reserves for legal claims decreased from $423.5 million at September 30, 2016 to $420.6 million at 

September 30, 2017. Changes in the Company’s legal claims reserves during fiscal 2017 and 2016 were as follows:

In the majority of states in which it operates, the Company has, and requires the majority of the subcontractors it 
uses to have, general liability insurance which includes construction defect coverage. The Company’s general liability 
insurance policies protect it against a portion of its risk of loss from construction defect and other claims and lawsuits, 
subject to self-insured retentions and other coverage limits. For policy years ended June 30, 2005 through 2018, the 
Company is self-insured for the first $10.0 million to $17.5 million of aggregate completed operations indemnity claims 
incurred, depending on the policy year. After the aggregate self-insurance limits have been satisfied, the Company’s 
excess loss insurance coverage begins. However, the Company must still pay $0.25 million of any indemnity claim and a 
portion of the legal fees incurred for each claim occurrence.

In some states where the Company believes it is too difficult or expensive for its subcontractors to obtain general 
liability insurance, the Company has waived its normal subcontractor general liability insurance requirements to obtain 
lower costs from subcontractors. In these states, the Company purchases insurance policies from either third-party 
carriers or its 100% owned captive insurance subsidiary and names certain subcontractors as additional insureds. The 
policies issued by the captive insurance subsidiary represent self-insurance of these risks by the Company. The Company 
is self-insured under its captive policies for up to $25.0 million in aggregate completed operations indemnity claims per 
policy year and for the first $0.25 million for each claim occurrence. For all policy years after April 2007, the captive 
insurance subsidiary has $15.0 million of excess loss insurance coverage with a third-party insurer. For policy years 
2016, 2017 and 2018, after consideration of the aforementioned $15.0 million of risk transfer, the Company is self-
insured under these captive policies for up to $10.0 million in aggregate completed operations indemnity claims, plus 
defense costs, per policy year and for up to $0.25 million for each claim occurrence.

The Company is self-insured for the deductible amounts under its workers’ compensation insurance policies. The 
deductibles vary by policy year, but in no years exceed $0.5 million per occurrence. The deductible for the 2016, 2017 
and 2018 policy years is $0.5 million per occurrence.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)

The Company estimates and records receivables under its applicable insurance policies related to its estimated 

contingencies for known claims and anticipated future construction defect claims on previously closed homes and other 
legal claims and lawsuits incurred in the ordinary course of business when recovery is probable. Additionally, the 
Company may have the ability to recover a portion of its losses from its subcontractors and their insurance carriers when 
the Company has been named as an additional insured on their insurance policies. The Company’s receivables related to 
its estimates of insurance recoveries from estimated losses for pending legal claims and anticipated future claims related 
to previously closed homes totaled $74.4 million and $88.7 million at September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and 
are included in homebuilding other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.

The estimation of losses related to these reserves and the related estimates of recoveries from insurance policies are 

subject to a high degree of variability due to uncertainties such as trends in construction defect claims relative to the 
Company’s markets and the types of products built, claim frequency, claim settlement costs and patterns, insurance 
industry practices and legal interpretations, among others. Due to the high degree of judgment required in establishing 
reserves for these contingencies, actual future costs and recoveries from insurance could differ significantly from current 
estimated amounts, and it is not possible for the Company to make a reasonable estimate of the possible loss or range of 
loss in excess of its reserves.

Land and Lot Option Purchase Contracts

The Company enters into land and lot option purchase contracts to acquire land or lots for the construction of 

homes. At September 30, 2017, the Company had total deposits of $227.6 million, consisting of cash deposits of $221.3 
million and promissory notes and letters of credit of $6.3 million, to purchase land and lots with a total remaining 
purchase price of approximately $4.6 billion. The majority of land and lots under contract are currently expected to be 
purchased within three years. A limited number of the land and lot option purchase contracts at September 30, 2017, 
representing $29.7 million of remaining purchase price, were subject to specific performance provisions which may 
require the Company to purchase the land or lots upon the land sellers meeting their contractual obligations.

Other Commitments

At September 30, 2017, the Company had outstanding surety bonds of $1.2 billion and letters of credit of $96.8 

million to secure performance under various contracts. Of the total letters of credit, $94.3 million were issued under the 
Company’s revolving credit facility. The remaining $2.5 million of letters of credit were issued under a secured letter of 
credit agreement requiring the Company to deposit cash as collateral with the issuing bank, and the cash restricted for 
this purpose is included in homebuilding restricted cash in the consolidated balance sheets.

The Company leases office space and equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. At September 30, 2017,

NOTE M – FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Fair value measurements are used for the Company’s mortgage loans held for sale, debt securities collateralized by 

residential real estate, IRLCs and other derivative instruments on a recurring basis and are used for inventories, other mortgage 
loans, rental properties and real estate owned on a nonrecurring basis, when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying 
value may not be recoverable. The fair value hierarchy and its application to the Company’s assets and liabilities is as follows:

•  Level 1 – Valuation is based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. The Company does not 

currently have any assets or liabilities measured at fair value using Level 1 inputs.

•  Level 2 – Valuation is determined from quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for 

identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, or by model-based techniques in which all significant 
inputs are observable in the market. The Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value using Level 2 inputs on a 
recurring basis are as follows:

•  Mortgage loans held for sale - The fair value of these loans is generally calculated by reference to quoted prices in 
secondary markets for commitments to sell mortgage loans with similar characteristics. Closed mortgage loans are 
typically sold shortly after origination, which limits exposure to nonperformance by loan buyer counterparties to a 
short time period. In addition, the Company actively monitors the financial strength of its counterparties.

• 

IRLCs - The fair value of IRLCs is calculated by reference to quoted prices in secondary markets for commitments to 
sell mortgage loans with similar characteristics. These valuations do not contain adjustments for expirations as any 
expired commitments are excluded from the fair value measurement. The Company generally only issues IRLCs for 
products that meet specific purchaser guidelines. Should any purchaser become insolvent, the Company would not be 
required to close the transaction based on the terms of the commitment. Since not all IRLCs will become closed 
loans, the Company adjusts its fair value measurements for the estimated amount of IRLCs that will not close.

•  Loan sale commitments and hedging instruments - The fair values of best-efforts and mandatory loan sale 

commitments and derivative instruments such as forward sales of MBS that are utilized as hedging instruments are 
calculated by reference to quoted prices for similar assets. The Company mitigates exposure to nonperformance risk 
associated with derivative instruments by limiting the number of counterparties and actively monitoring their 
financial strength and creditworthiness while requiring them to be well-known institutions with credit ratings equal to 
or better than AA- or equivalent. Further, the Company’s derivative contracts typically have short-term durations with 
maturities from one to four months. Accordingly, the Company’s risk of nonperformance relative to its derivative 
positions is not significant.

The Company’s assets measured at fair value using Level 2 inputs on a nonrecurring basis are a limited number of 
mortgage loans held for sale with some degree of impairment affecting their marketability and are reported at the lower 
of carrying value or fair value. When available, fair value is determined by reference to quoted prices in the secondary 
markets for such assets.

After consideration of nonperformance risk, no additional adjustments were made to the fair value measurements of 
mortgage loans held for sale, IRLCs or hedging instruments.

D.R. HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)

•  Level 3 – Valuation is typically derived from model-based techniques in which at least one significant input is 

unobservable and based on the Company’s own estimates about the assumptions that market participants would use to 
value the asset or liability.

The Company’s assets measured at fair value using Level 3 inputs on a recurring basis are its debt securities 
collateralized by residential real estate and a limited number of mortgage loans held for sale with some degree of 
impairment affecting their marketability and for which reference to quoted prices in the secondary markets is not 
available.

The Company’s assets measured at fair value using Level 3 inputs that are typically reported at the lower of carrying 
value or fair value on a nonrecurring basis are as follows:

• 

• 

Inventory held and used - In determining the fair values of its inventory held and used in its impairment evaluations, 
the Company performs an analysis of the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets. The 
most significant factors used to estimate undiscounted future cash flows include pricing and incentive levels actually 
realized by the community, the rate at which the homes are sold and the costs incurred to develop the lots and 
construct the homes. Inventory held and used measured at fair value represents those communities for which the 
estimated undiscounted cash flows are less than their carrying amounts and therefore, the Company has recorded 
impairments during the current period to record the inventory at fair value calculated based on its discounted 
estimated future cash flows.

Inventory available for sale - The factors considered in determining fair values of the Company’s land held for sale 
primarily include actual sale contracts and recent offers received from outside third parties, and may also include 
prices for land in recent comparable sales transactions and other market analysis. If the estimated fair value less the 
costs to sell an asset is less than the asset’s current carrying value, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value 
less costs to sell.

•  Certain mortgage loans held for sale - A limited number of mortgage loans held for sale have some degree of 

impairment affecting their marketability. For some of these loans, quoted prices in the secondary market are not 
available and therefore, a cash flow valuation model is used to determine fair value.

•  Certain other mortgage loans, rental properties and real estate owned - Other mortgage loans include performing and 

nonperforming mortgage loans, which often become real estate owned through the foreclosure process. The fair 
values of other mortgage loans, rental properties and real estate owned are determined based on the Company’s 
assessment of the value of the underlying collateral or the value of the property, as applicable. The Company uses 
different methods to assess the value of the properties, which may include broker price opinions, appraisals or cash 
flow valuation models.

Mortgage loans held for sale (a) ........
_____________
(a)  Mortgage loans held for sale are reflected at fair value. Interest income earned on mortgage loans held for sale is based on contractual interest 
rates and included in financial services interest and other income. Mortgage loans held for sale at September 30, 2017 and 2016 include $5.6 
million and $6.8 million, respectively, of loans for which the Company elected the fair value option upon origination and which the Company did 
not sell into the secondary market. Mortgage loans held for sale totaling $10.9 million and $17.6 million were transferred to Level 3 during fiscal 
2017 and 2016, respectively, due to significant unobservable inputs used in determining the fair value of these loans. The fair value of these 
mortgage loans held for sale is generally calculated considering pricing in the secondary market and adjusted for the value of the underlying 
collateral, including interest rate risk, liquidity risk and prepayment risk. The Company plans to sell these loans as market conditions permit.

(a)  In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, income before income taxes was reduced by a goodwill impairment charge of $7.2 

million.

The Company experiences variability in its results of operations from quarter to quarter due to the seasonal nature 

of its homebuilding business. The Company generally closes more homes and has greater revenues and income before 
income taxes in the third and fourth quarters (June and September) than in the first and second quarters (December and 
March) of its fiscal year.

NOTE P – SUBSEQUENT EVENT

On October 5, 2017, the Company acquired 75% of the outstanding shares of Forestar for $558.3 million in cash, 
pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement entered into in June 2017. Forestar is and will continue to be a publicly-
traded residential and real estate development company with operations currently in 14 markets and 10 states, where it 
owns, directly or through joint ventures, interests in 44 residential and mixed-use projects.

The Company’s alignment with Forestar advances its strategy of increasing its access to high-quality optioned land 

and lot positions to enhance operational efficiency and returns. Both companies are identifying land development 
opportunities to expand Forestar’s platform, and the Company plans to acquire a large portion of Forestar’s finished lots 
in accordance with the master supply agreement between the two companies. As the controlling shareholder of Forestar, 
the Company will have significant influence in guiding the strategic direction and driving the operational execution 
necessary to increase the future value potential of Forestar.

The Company has hired a valuation firm to assist in the allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and 

liabilities assumed. As of the date of issuance of the financial statements the purchase price allocation had not been 
completed. The Company anticipates the purchase price will be allocated primarily to the tangible assets acquired and 
liabilities assumed of Forestar, but does anticipate some intangible assets arising from the transaction.

NOTE Q – SUPPLEMENTAL GUARANTOR INFORMATION

All of the Company’s senior notes and the unsecured revolving credit facility are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, 

on a joint and several basis, by D.R. Horton, Inc. and other subsidiaries (Guarantor Subsidiaries). Each of the Guarantor 
Subsidiaries is 100% owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company. The Company’s subsidiaries engaged in the financial 
services segment and certain other subsidiaries do not guarantee the Company’s senior notes and the unsecured revolving 
credit facility (collectively, Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries). In lieu of providing separate financial statements for the Guarantor 
Subsidiaries, consolidating condensed financial statements are presented below. Separate financial statements and other 
disclosures concerning the Guarantor Subsidiaries are not presented because management has determined that they are not 
material to investors.

The guarantees by a Guarantor Subsidiary will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon: (1) 

the sale or other disposition of its common stock whereby it is no longer a subsidiary of the Company; (2) the sale or other 
disposition of all or substantially all of its assets (other than to the Company or another Guarantor); (3) its merger or 
consolidation with an entity other than the Company or another Guarantor; or (4) depending on the provisions of the 
applicable indenture, either (a) its proper designation as an unrestricted subsidiary, (b) its ceasing to guarantee any of the 
Company’s publicly traded debt securities, or (c) its ceasing to guarantee any of the Company’s obligations under the 
revolving credit facility.

AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

None.

ITEM 9A.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the 

participation of the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer 
(CFO), of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 
15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that the 
Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2017 were effective in providing reasonable 
assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports the Company files, furnishes, submits or otherwise 
provides the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized 
and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that information required to be 
disclosed in reports filed by the Company under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s 
management, including the CEO and CFO, in such a manner as to allow timely decisions regarding the required 
disclosure.

There have been no changes in the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended 
September 30, 2017 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over 
financial reporting.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, 

as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Internal control over financial 
reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the 
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting 
principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect 
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls 
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or 
procedures may deteriorate.

Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on 

the framework in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring 
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s 
internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2017.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the effectiveness of 

our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2017, as stated in their report included herein.
