Cautionary Statement and Regulation G Disclosure
This 2017 Annual Report contains forward-looking statements in which FCX discusses its potential future performance. FCX cautions 
readers that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results may differ materially from those 
anticipated, projected or assumed in the forward-looking statements. This report also includes statements regarding mineralized material 
and potential resources not included in proven and probable mineral reserves. Mineralized material is a mineralized body that has been 
delineated by appropriately spaced drilling and/or underground sampling to support the estimated tonnage and average metal grades. 
Such a deposit cannot qualify as recoverable proven and probable reserves until legal and economic feasibility are confirmed based upon 
a comprehensive evaluation. FCX’s estimates of potential resources are based on geologically reasonable interpolation and extrapolation 
of more limited information than is used for mineralized material (measured and indicated) and requires higher copper prices. Significant 
additional drilling is required and no assurance can be given that the potential quantities of metal will be produced. Accordingly, no 
assurances can be given that estimated mineralized material and potential resources will become proven and probable reserves. Please 
refer to the Cautionary Statement on page 62 of this report. This 2017 Annual Report also contains certain financial measures, such as unit 
net cash costs and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), which are not recognized under U.S. 
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). As required by U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation G, reconciliations of 
unit net cash costs and adjusted EBITDA to amounts reported in FCX’s consolidated financial statements are available beginning on page 52 
of this report and in FCX’s fourth-quarter 2017 earnings conference call presentation, which is available on FCX’s website at “fcx.com.”

LETTER TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS

DEAR FELLOW 
SHAREHOLDERS 

We are pleased to present to you our Annual Report 

“Powered by Copper.” As a leading global copper 

producer, we are keenly focused on generating long-

term values for shareholders through our large-scale and 

geographically diverse portfolio of long-lived copper 

reserves and resources.

The fundamental market outlook for copper is decidedly 

more positive than it has been in several years, driven by 

a resurgence in global economic growth and by limited 

supplies. The acceleration of economic activity across 

the globe, investments in infrastructure including power 

grids, and the increasing role of renewable energy will 

continue to drive growth in global copper demand. 

Strengthening demand is occurring following an extended 

Freeport-McMoRan is firmly positioned to benefit from 

the improved market conditions for copper. Our cash 

flows are underpinned by strong production capacity 

and ongoing cost management. We also benefit from 

a competitive position of strength with our long-lived 

reserves and resources, an attractive inventory of 

potential new low-risk development projects largely 

focused in the Americas and a highly qualified and 

proven technical team to execute our strategy.

Our team is actively engaged in reviewing a number 

of expansion opportunities associated with existing 

operations in the United States and Chile to enhance 

net present values through the development of large 

sulfide mineralization encountered through successful 

exploration activities. Economic and technical studies 

are being developed to provide future options for long-

term growth as conditions warrant.

OPERATIONAL OVERVIEW

INDONESIA 
MINING

Through its subsidiary, PT-FI, FCX mines one of the world’s largest copper and 

gold deposits in the Grasberg minerals district in Papua, Indonesia. In addition 

to copper and gold, PT-FI produces silver. 

The Grasberg minerals district has three operating mines: the Grasberg open 

pit, the Deep Ore Zone underground mine and the Big Gossan underground 

mine. In September 2015, PT-FI initiated pre-commercial 

production at the Deep Mill Level Zone underground mine. 

In aggregate, the Grasberg 
underground ore bodies are 
expected to produce large-scale 
quantities of copper and gold 
following the transition from 
open-pit mining in early 2019.

PT-FI has several projects in progress in the Grasberg 

minerals district related to the development of large-

scale, long-lived, high-grade underground ore bodies. In 

aggregate, these underground ore bodies are expected 

to produce large-scale quantities of copper and gold 

following the transition from the Grasberg open pit in  

early 2019.

Consolidated sales from Indonesia mining totaled 981 million pounds of 

copper (average realized price of $3.00 per pound) and 1.5 million ounces 

of gold (average realized price of $1,268 per ounce) in 2017, and 1.1 billion 

pounds of copper (average realized price of $2.32 per pound) and 1.1 million 

ounces of gold (average realized price of $1,237 per ounce) in 2016. Assuming 

achievement of planned operating rates, FCX expects consolidated sales from 

Indonesia mining to approximate 1.2 billion pounds of copper and 2.4 million 

ounces of gold in 2018. 

PT-FI continues to engage with Indonesian government officials to address 

regulatory changes that conflict with its contract rights in a manner that 

provides long-term stability for PT-FI’s operations and investment plans, and 

protects value for FCX’s shareholders.

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 

Operating Cash Flow and Liquidity

During 2017, FCX generated operating cash flows of $4.7 billion. At      

December 31, 2017, FCX had consolidated cash of $4.4 billion and total debt of 

$13.1 billion, and had no borrowings under its revolving credit facility, which has 

availability of $3.5 billion. 

Based on current sales volume and cost estimates, and assuming average  

prices of $3.15 per pound of copper, $1,300 per ounce of gold and $10.00 per 

pound of molybdenum, FCX estimates consolidated operating cash flows will 

exceed $5.8 billion in 2018. 

Investing Activities

FCX’s capital expenditures totaled $1.4 billion in 2017, including $0.9 billion 

for major mining projects. Capital expenditures are expected to approximate 

$2.1 billion in 2018, including $1.2 billion for major mining projects, primarily 

associated with underground development activities in the Grasberg    

minerals district and development of the Lone Star oxide project. 

Financing Transactions

Net repayments of debt in 2017 totaled $2.9 billion, primarily for the 

redemption and repayment of senior notes. 

In February 2018, the Board of Directors reinstated a cash dividend on FCX’s 

common stock. FCX continues to manage costs and capital spending, and 

subject to commodity prices and operational results, expects to generate 

significant operating cash flows for further debt reduction during 2018.

MINING RESERVES AND MINERALIZED MATERIAL

MINING RESERVES AND  
MINERALIZED MATERIAL

FCX has significant mineral reserves, resources and future development 

opportunities within its portfolio of mining assets. At December 31,  

2017, estimated consolidated recoverable proven and probable mineral 

reserves totaled 86.7 billion pounds of copper, 23.5 million ounces of gold,  

2.84 billion pounds of molybdenum and 273.4 million ounces of silver. These 

estimates were determined using $2.00 per pound for 

copper, $1,000 per ounce for gold, $10 per pound for 

molybdenum and $15 per ounce for silver. 

FCX’s operating mines and other properties also contain 

mineralized material that it believes could be brought 

into production should market conditions warrant. At 

December 31, 2017, FCX identified estimated mineralized 

material totaling 92 billion pounds of incremental 

contained copper, which was assessed using  

$2.20 per pound.

Our team is actively engaged 
in reviewing a number of 
expansion opportunities 
associated with existing 
operations in the Americas to 
enhance net present values 
through the development of 
large sulfide mineralization 
encountered through successful 
exploration activities.

results in recent years at 
El Abra in Chile indicate 
a significant sulfide 
resource, which could 
potentially support a 
major mill project.

In Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition 
and Results of Operations and Quantitative and Qualitative 
Disclosures About Market Risk (MD&A), “we,” “us” and “our” 
refer to Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (FCX) and its consolidated 
subsidiaries. The results of operations reported and 
summarized below are not necessarily indicative of future 
operating results (refer to “Cautionary Statement” for further 
discussion). References to “Notes” are Notes included in  
our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Throughout 
MD&A, all references to earnings or losses per share are  
on a diluted basis, unless otherwise noted. Additionally, in 
accordance with accounting guidelines, TF Holdings Limited 
(TFHL), through which we held a controlling interest in  
the Tenke Fungurume (Tenke) mine until it was sold on 
November 16, 2016, is reported as a discontinued operation  
for all periods presented.

OVERVIEW

We are a leading international mining company with 
headquarters in Phoenix, Arizona. We operate large, long-lived, 
geographically diverse assets with significant proven and 
probable reserves of copper, gold and molybdenum. We are 
the world’s largest publicly traded copper producer. Our 
portfolio of assets includes the Grasberg minerals district in 
Indonesia, one of the world’s largest copper and gold deposits; 
and significant mining operations in the Americas, including 
the large-scale Morenci minerals district in North America and 
the Cerro Verde operation in South America.

We have taken actions to restore our balance sheet strength 

through a combination of asset sale transactions and capital 
market transactions. We completed approximately $6.7 billion 
in asset sale transactions (mostly in 2016), including the sale  
of substantially all of our oil and gas properties, our interest in 
TFHL and the sale of an additional 13 percent undivided 
interest in the Morenci minerals district (refer to Note 2 for 
further discussion of dispositions). During 2016, we also 
completed a registered at-the-market offering of our common 
stock, which generated $1.5 billion in gross proceeds through 
the sale of 116.5 million shares of our common stock, and 
redeemed $369 million in senior notes for 27.7 million shares of 
our common stock (refer to Note 10 for further discussion). 
Additionally, in 2016, we settled $1.1 billion in aggregate 
drillship contracts for $755 million, of which $540 million was 
funded with 48.1 million shares of our common stock (refer to 
Notes 10 and 13 for further discussion).

These actions, combined with cash flow from operations, 

resulted in net reductions of debt totaling $2.9 billion  
during 2017 and $4.3 billion during 2016, and an increase in 
consolidated cash from $177 million at December 31, 2015,  
to $4.2 billion at December 31, 2016, and $4.4 billion at 
December 31, 2017. We continue to manage costs and capital 

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS

spending and, subject to commodity prices and operational 
results, expect to generate significant operating cash flows for 
further debt reduction during 2018. 

Net income (loss) attributable to common stock totaled  

$1.8 billion in 2017, $(4.2) billion in 2016 and $(12.2) billion in 
2015. Our results in 2017 benefited from higher copper prices 
and higher gold sales volumes. Our prior years’ results were 
unfavorably impacted by charges for the impairment of oil and 
gas properties totaling $4.3 billion in 2016 and $11.6 billion in 
2015. Refer to “Consolidated Results” for discussion of items 
impacting our consolidated results for the three years ended 
December 31, 2017.

At December 31, 2017, we had $4.4 billion in consolidated 

cash and cash equivalents and $13.1 billion in total debt.  
We had no borrowings and $3.5 billion available under our 
revolving credit facility. 

We believe that we have a high-quality portfolio of long-

lived copper assets positioned to generate long-term value. 
We have commenced a project to develop the Lone Star oxide 
ores near the Safford operation in eastern Arizona. We are  
also pursuing other opportunities to enhance net present values, 
and we continue to advance studies for future development  
of our copper resources, the timing of which will be dependent 
on market conditions.

We have significant mineral reserves, resources and future 

development opportunities within our portfolio of mining 
assets. At December 31, 2017, our estimated consolidated 
recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves totaled  
86.7 billion pounds of copper, 23.5 million ounces of gold and 
2.84 billion pounds of molybdenum, which were determined 
using $2.00 per pound for copper, $1,000 per ounce for gold 
and $10 per pound for molybdenum. Refer to “Critical 
Accounting Estimates—Mineral Reserves” for further discussion.

During 2017, production from our mines totaled 3.7 billion 

pounds of copper, 1.6 million ounces of gold and 92 million 
pounds of molybdenum. Following is a summary of the 
geographic locations of our consolidated copper, gold and 
molybdenum production in 2017:

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS

As further discussed in Note 13 and “Operations—Indonesia 

Mining,” PT Freeport Indonesia (PT-FI) continues to actively 
engage with Indonesian government officials to address 
regulatory changes that conflict with its contractual rights in  
a manner that provides long-term stability for PT-FI’s 
operations and investment plans, and protects value for our 
shareholders. Following a framework understanding  
reached in August 2017, the parties have been engaged in 
negotiation and documentation of a special license (IUPK) and 
accompanying documentation for assurances on legal and 
fiscal terms to provide PT-FI with long-term rights through 
2041. In addition, the IUPK would provide that PT-FI construct 
a smelter within five years of reaching a definitive agreement 
and include agreement for the divestment of 51 percent of the 
project area interests to Indonesian participants at fair market 
value. The parties continue to negotiate documentation on a 
comprehensive agreement for PT-FI’s extended operations 
and to reach agreement on timing, process and governance 
matters relating to the divestment. The parties have a mutual 
objective of completing negotiations and the required 
documentation during the first half of 2018.

OUTLOOK

We continue to view the long-term outlook for our business 
positively, supported by limitations on supplies of copper and 
by the requirements for copper in the world’s economy. Our 
financial results vary as a result of fluctuations in market prices 
primarily for copper, gold and molybdenum, as well as other 
factors. World market prices for these commodities have 
fluctuated historically and are affected by numerous factors 
beyond our control. Because we cannot control the price of 
our products, the key measures that management focuses on 
in operating our business are sales volumes, unit net cash 
costs, operating cash flow and capital expenditures.

Refer to “Operations—Indonesia Mining” for further discussion 
of Indonesia regulatory matters, which could have a significant 
impact on future results.

Sales Volumes. Following are projected consolidated sales 
volumes for 2018 and actual consolidated sales volumes from 
continuing operations for 2017:

 
 

 
 
Copper (millions of recoverable pounds):

a.  Projected molybdenum sales include 35 million pounds produced by our Molybdenum mines and  

56 million pounds produced by our North America and South America copper mines.

26

Freeport-McMoRan

Consolidated sales for first-quarter 2018 are expected to 
approximate 1.0 billion pounds of copper, 675 thousand ounces 
of gold and 24 million pounds of molybdenum. Projected 
sales volumes are dependent on operational performance 
and other factors. For other important factors that could 
cause results to differ materially from projections, refer to 
“Cautionary Statement.”

Unit Net Cash Costs. Assuming average prices of $1,300  

per ounce of gold and $10.00 per pound of molybdenum for 
2018 and achievement of current sales volume and cost 
estimates, consolidated unit net cash costs (net of by-product 
credits) for our copper mines are expected to average $0.97 
per pound of copper in 2018. The impact of price changes  
in 2018 on consolidated unit net cash costs would approximate 
$0.03 per pound for each $50 per ounce change in the 
average price of gold and $0.025 per pound for each $2 per 
pound change in the average price of molybdenum. Quarterly 
unit net cash costs vary with fluctuations in sales volumes  
and realized prices, primarily for gold and molybdenum. Refer 
to “Consolidated Results—Production and Delivery Costs”  
for further discussion of consolidated production costs for our 
mining operations.

Consolidated Operating Cash Flow. Our consolidated 

operating cash flows vary with sales volumes, prices realized 
from copper, gold and molybdenum sales, production costs, 
income taxes, other working capital changes and other 
factors. Based on current sales volume and cost estimates, 
and assuming average prices of $3.15 per pound of copper, 
$1,300 per ounce of gold and $10.00 per pound of molybdenum, 
our consolidated operating cash flows are estimated to 
exceed $5.8 billion in 2018 (including $0.3 billion in working 
capital sources and timing of other tax payments).  
Estimated consolidated operating cash flows in 2018 also 
reflect a projected income tax provision of $2.2 billion (refer  
to “Consolidated Results—Income Taxes” for further discussion 
of our projected income tax rate for the year 2018). The 
impact of price changes in 2018 on consolidated operating 
cash flows would approximate $360 million for each $0.10 per 
pound change in the average price of copper, $115 million for 
each $50 per ounce change in the average price of gold and 
$130 million for each $2 per pound change in the average 
price of molybdenum.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS

declined because of concerns about slowing growth rates in 
China, a stronger United States (U.S.) dollar and a broad-
based decline in commodity prices, but began to improve in 
fourth-quarter 2016 and throughout 2017. For the year 2017, 
LME spot copper prices ranged from a low of $2.48 per 
pound to a high of $3.27 per pound, averaged $2.80 per 
pound and closed at $3.25 per pound on December 31, 2017. 
The LME spot copper price was $3.22 per pound on  
January 31, 2018.

We believe the underlying long-term fundamentals of the 

copper business remain positive, supported by the significant 
role of copper in the global economy and a challenging 
long-term supply environment attributable to difficulty in 
replacing existing large mines’ output with new production 
sources. Future copper prices are expected to be volatile and 
are likely to be influenced by demand from China and 
emerging markets, as well as economic activity in the U.S. and 
other industrialized countries, the timing of the development 
of new supplies of copper and production levels of mines and 
copper smelters.

This graph presents London PM gold prices from January 
2008 through December 2017. An improving economic 
outlook, stronger U.S. dollar and positive equity performance 
contributed to lower demand for gold since 2014. During  
2017, London PM gold prices ranged from a low of $1,151 per  
ounce to a high of $1,346 per ounce, averaged $1,257 per ounce 
and closed at $1,297 per ounce on December 31, 2017. The 
London PM gold price was $1,345 per ounce on January 31, 2018.

Consolidated Capital Expenditures. Consolidated capital 

expenditures are expected to approximate $2.1 billion in 2018, 
including $1.2 billion for major mining projects, primarily 
associated with underground development activities in the 
Grasberg minerals district and development of the Lone Star 
oxide project. If PT-FI is unable to reach a definitive 
agreement with the Indonesian government on its long-term 
mining rights, we intend to reduce or defer investments 
significantly in underground development projects and will 
pursue dispute resolution procedures under PT-FI’s Contract 
of Work (COW).

MARKETS

World prices for copper, gold and molybdenum can fluctuate 
significantly. During the period from January 2008 through 
December 2017, the London Metal Exchange (LME) spot 
copper price varied from a low of $1.26 per pound in 2008 to a 
record high of $4.60 per pound in 2011; the London Bullion 
Market Association (London) PM gold price fluctuated from a 
low of $713 per ounce in 2008 to a record high of $1,895 per 
ounce in 2011; and the Metals Week Molybdenum Dealer  
Oxide weekly average price ranged from a low of $4.46 per 
pound in 2015 to a high of $33.88 per pound in 2008. Copper, 
gold and molybdenum prices are affected by numerous 
factors beyond our control as described further in our  
“Risk Factors” contained in Part I, Item 1A. of our annual report 
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.

This graph presents the Metals Week Molybdenum Dealer 
Oxide weekly average price from January 2008 through 
December 2017. Molybdenum prices have declined since 
mid-2014 because of weaker demand from global steel and 
stainless steel producers but have improved beginning in 
mid-2016. During 2017, the weekly average price for molybdenum 
ranged from a low of $6.98 per pound to a high of $10.15  
per pound, averaged $8.21 per pound and was $10.15 per 
pound on December 31, 2017. The Metals Week Molybdenum 
Dealer Oxide weekly average price was $1 1.87 per pound  
on January 31, 2018.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

MD&A is based on our consolidated financial statements, which 
have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted 
accounting principles (GAAP) in the U.S. The preparation  
of these statements requires that we make estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, 
liabilities, revenues and expenses. We base these estimates on 
historical experience and on assumptions that we consider 
reasonable under the circumstances; however, reported results 
could differ from those based on the current estimates under 
different assumptions or conditions. The areas requiring  
the use of management’s estimates are also discussed in Note 1 
under the subheading “Use of Estimates.” Management  
has reviewed the following discussion of its development and 
selection of critical accounting estimates with the Audit 
Committee of our Board of Directors (the Board). 

Mineral Reserves. Recoverable proven and probable reserves 

are the part of a mineral deposit that can be economically  

28

Freeport-McMoRan

and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve 
determination. The determination of reserves involves 
numerous uncertainties with respect to the ultimate geology 
of the ore bodies, including quantities, grades and recovery 
rates. Estimating the quantity and grade of mineral reserves 
requires us to determine the size, shape and depth of our  
ore bodies by analyzing geological data, such as samplings of 
drill holes, tunnels and other underground workings. In 
addition to the geology of our mines, assumptions are required 
to determine the economic feasibility of mining these reserves, 
including estimates of future commodity prices and demand, 
the mining methods we use and the related costs incurred to 
develop and mine our reserves. Our estimates of recoverable 
proven and probable mineral reserves are prepared by and are 
the responsibility of our employees. A majority of these 
estimates are reviewed annually and verified by independent 
experts in mining, geology and reserve determination.

At December 31, 2017, our consolidated estimated recoverable 

proven and probable reserves were determined using $2.00 
per pound for copper, $1,000 per ounce for gold and $10 per 
pound for molybdenum. The following table summarizes 
changes in our estimated consolidated recoverable proven 
and probable copper, gold and molybdenum reserves during 
2017 and 2016:

Refer to Note 20 for further information regarding estimated 
recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS

As discussed in Note 1, we depreciate our life-of-mine 

mining and milling assets and values assigned to proven and 
probable mineral reserves using the unit-of-production (UOP) 
method based on our estimated recoverable proven and 
probable mineral reserves. Because the economic assumptions 
used to estimate mineral reserves may change from period to 
period and additional geological data is generated during the 
course of operations, estimates of reserves may change, which 
could have a significant impact on our results of operations, 
including changes to prospective depreciation rates and 
impairments of long-lived asset carrying values. Excluding 
impacts associated with changes in the levels of finished goods 
inventories and based on projected copper sales volumes,  
if estimated copper reserves at our mines were 10 percent 
higher at December 31, 2017, we estimate that our annual 
depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) expense for 
2018 would decrease by $45 million ($24 million to net income 
attributable to common stockholders), and a 10 percent 
decrease in copper reserves would increase DD&A expense by 
$55 million ($29 million to net income attributable to 
common stockholders). We perform annual assessments of 
our existing assets in connection with the review of mine 
operating and development plans. If it is determined that 
assigned asset lives do not reflect the expected remaining 
period of benefit, any change could affect prospective  
DD&A rates.

As discussed below and in Note 1, we review and evaluate 

our long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes 
in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amount of 
such assets may not be recoverable, and changes to our 
estimates of recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves 
could have an impact on our assessment of asset recoverability. 
Refer to “Risk Factors” contained in Part I, Item 1A. of our 
annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 
2017, for further discussion of Indonesian regulatory matters 
that could have a material adverse affect on our cash flow, 
results of operations and financial position, and could result in 
asset impairments at PT-FI.

copper from mill and leach stockpiles represents a critical 
accounting estimate because (i) it is impracticable to 
determine copper contained in mill and leach stockpiles by 
physical count, thus requiring management to employ 
reasonable estimation methods and (ii) recovery rates from 
leach stockpiles can vary significantly. Refer to Note 1 for 
further discussion of our accounting policy for recoverable 
copper in stockpiles.

At December 31, 2017, estimated consolidated recoverable 

copper was 2.1 billion pounds in leach stockpiles (with a 
carrying value of $2.2 billion) and 0.7 billion pounds in mill 
stockpiles (with a carrying value of $660 million), compared 
with 2.2 billion pounds in leach stockpiles (with a carrying 
value of $2.2 billion) and 1.0 billion pounds in mill stockpiles 
(with a carrying value of $746 million) at December 31, 2016.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. As discussed in Note 1,  

we assess the carrying values of our long-lived mining assets 
when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
related carrying amounts of such assets may not be 
recoverable. In evaluating our long-lived mining assets for 
recoverability, we use estimates of pre-tax undiscounted 
future cash flows of our individual mines. Estimates of future 
cash flows are derived from current business plans, which  
are developed using near-term metal price forecasts reflective 
of the current price environment and management’s 
projections for long-term average metal prices. In addition to 
near- and long-term metal price assumptions, other key 
assumptions include estimates of commodity-based and other 
input costs; proven and probable mineral reserves estimates, 
including the timing and cost to develop and produce the 
reserves; value beyond proven and probable mineral reserve 
estimates (refer to Note 1); and the use of appropriate discount 
rates in the measurement of fair value. We believe our 
estimates and models used to determine fair value are similar 
to what a market participant would use. As quoted market 
prices are unavailable for our individual mining operations, fair 
value is determined through the use of after-tax discounted 
estimated future cash flows.

Recoverable Copper in Stockpiles. We record, as inventory, 

As a result of declining copper and molybdenum prices, 

applicable costs for copper contained in mill and leach 
stockpiles that are expected to be processed in the future 
based on proven processing technologies. Mill and leach 
stockpiles are evaluated periodically to ensure that they are 
stated at the lower of weighted-average cost or net realizable 
value (refer to Note 4 and “Consolidated Results” for further 
discussion of inventory adjustments recorded for the three 
years ended December 31, 2017). Accounting for recoverable 

during the second half of 2015, we evaluated our long-lived 
mining assets for impairment, which resulted in charges  
of $37 million at our Tyrone mine, net of a revision to asset 
retirement obligations (AROs). Refer to Note 5 for further 
discussion of price assumptions used in our December 31, 2015, 
evaluations of the recoverability of our copper and 
molybdenum mines. At December 31, 2016 and 2017, we 
concluded there were no events or changes in circumstances

AND ANALYSIS

that would indicate that the carrying amount of our long-
lived mining assets might not be recoverable.

In addition to decreases in future metal price assumptions, 

other events that could result in future impairment of  
our long-lived mining assets include, but are not limited to, 
decreases in estimated recoverable proven and probable 
mineral reserves and any event that might otherwise have a 
material adverse effect on mine site production levels or  
costs. Refer to “Risk Factors” contained in Part I, Item 1A.  
of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended 
December 31, 2017, for further discussion of Indonesian 
regulatory matters that could have a material adverse affect  
on our cash flow, results of operations and financial  
position, and could result in asset impairments at PT-FI.

Environmental Obligations. Our current and historical 

operating activities are subject to various national, state and 
local environmental laws and regulations that govern the 
protection of the environment, and compliance with those laws 
requires significant expenditures. Environmental expenditures 
are charged to expense or capitalized, depending upon  
their future economic benefits. The guidance provided by U.S. 
GAAP requires that liabilities for contingencies be recorded 
when it is probable that obligations have been incurred, and the 
cost can be reasonably estimated. At December 31, 2017, 
environmental obligations recorded in our consolidated balance 
sheet totaled $1.4 billion, which reflect obligations for 
environmental liabilities attributed to the Comprehensive 
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability  
Act of 1980 (CERCLA) or analogous state programs and for 
estimated future costs associated with environmental 
matters. Refer to Notes 1 and 12 for further discussion of 
environmental obligations, including a summary of changes in 
our estimated environmental obligations for the three years 
ended December 31, 2017.

Accounting for environmental obligations represents a 

critical accounting estimate because changes to environmental 
laws and regulations and/or circumstances affecting our 
operations could result in significant changes to our estimates, 
which could have a significant impact on our results of 
operations. We perform a comprehensive annual review of our 
environmental obligations and also review changes in facts 
and circumstances associated with these obligations at least 
quarterly. Judgments and estimates are based upon currently 
available facts, existing technology, presently enacted laws  
and regulations, remediation experience, whether or not we 

are a potentially responsible party (PRP), the ability of other 
PRPs to pay their allocated portions and take into consideration 
reasonably possible outcomes. Our cost estimates can 
change substantially as additional information becomes 
available regarding the nature or extent of site contamination, 
updated cost assumptions (including increases and 
decreases to cost estimates), changes in the anticipated scope 
and timing of remediation activities, the settlement of 
environmental matters, required remediation methods and 
actions by or against governmental agencies or private parties.

Asset Retirement Obligations. We record the fair value of 

our estimated AROs associated with tangible long-lived assets 
in the period incurred. Fair value is measured as the present 
value of cash flow estimates after considering inflation and a 
market risk premium. Our cost estimates are reflected on  
a third-party cost basis and comply with our legal obligation 
to retire tangible long-lived assets in the period incurred. 
These cost estimates may differ from financial assurance cost 
estimates for reclamation activities because of a variety of 
factors, including obtaining updated cost estimates for 
reclamation activities, the timing of reclamation activities, 
changes in scope and the exclusion of certain costs not 
considered reclamation and closure costs. At December 31, 2017, 
AROs recorded in our consolidated balance sheet totaled 
$2.6 billion, including $0.6 billion associated with our 
remaining oil and gas operations. Refer to Notes 1 and 12 for 
further discussion of reclamation and closure costs, including 
a summary of changes in our AROs for the three years ended 
December 31, 2017.

Generally, ARO activities are specified by regulations or in 

permits issued by the relevant governing authority, and 
management judgment is required to estimate the extent and 
timing of expenditures. Accounting for AROs represents  
a critical accounting estimate because (i) we will not incur 
most of these costs for a number of years, requiring us to 
make estimates over a long period, (ii) reclamation and closure 
laws and regulations could change in the future and/or 
circumstances affecting our operations could change, either of 
which could result in significant changes to our current plans, 
(iii) the methods used or required to plug and abandon 
non-producing oil and gas wellbores, remove platforms, 
tanks, production equipment and flow lines, and restore the 
wellsite could change, (iv) calculating the fair value of our 
AROs requires management to estimate projected cash flows, 
make long-term assumptions about inflation rates, determine 
our credit-adjusted, risk-free interest rates and determine

AND ANALYSIS

Our valuation allowances totaled $4.6 billion at December 31, 

2017, which covered U.S. federal and state deferred tax 
assets, including all of our U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards, 
U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards, U.S. federal 
capital loss carryforwards, foreign net operating loss 
carryforwards, and substantially all of our U.S. state net 
operating loss carryforwards.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act) enacted on December 22, 

2017, includes significant modifications to existing U.S. tax 
laws and creates many new complex tax provisions. The Act 
reduces the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent, eliminates 
the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT), provides  
for a refund of AMT credit carryover, maintains hard minerals 
percentage depletion, allows for immediate expensing  
of certain qualified property and generally broadens the tax 
base. The Act also creates a territorial tax system (with  
a one-time mandatory tax on previously deferred foreign 
earnings), creates anti-base erosion rules that require 
companies to pay a minimum tax on foreign earnings and 
disallows certain payments from U.S. corporations to foreign 
related parties. Our income tax provision for 2017 includes 
provisional net tax credits associated with the Act totaling 
$393 million, including the reversal of valuation allowances 
associated with anticipated refunds of AMT credits over the 
next four years ($272 million, net of reserves) and a decrease 
in corporate income tax rates ($121 million). Our income tax 
provision for 2017 was not impacted by the Act’s one-time tax 
on deferred foreign earnings, as we have sufficient foreign  
tax credits to offset the tax. As the Act’s tax provisions are 
numerous and complex, we continue to evaluate their impact. 
Refer to Note 11 for further discussion.

market risk premiums that are appropriate for our operations 
and (v) given the magnitude of our estimated reclamation, 
mine closure and wellsite abandonment and restoration costs, 
changes in any or all of these estimates could have a significant 
impact on our results of operations.

Taxes. In preparing our annual consolidated financial 

statements, we estimate the actual amount of income taxes 
currently payable or receivable as well as deferred income  
tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences 
between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing 
assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred 
income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted 
tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years  
in which these temporary differences are expected to be 
recovered or settled. The effect on deferred income tax assets 
and liabilities of a change in tax rates or laws is recognized  
in income in the period in which such changes are enacted.

Our operations are in multiple jurisdictions where uncertainties 

arise in the application of complex tax regulations. Some of 
these tax regimes are defined by contractual agreements with 
the local government, while others are defined by general  
tax laws and regulations. We and our subsidiaries are subject 
to reviews of our income tax filings and other tax payments, 
and disputes can arise with the taxing authorities over the 
interpretation of our contracts or laws. Final taxes paid may 
be dependent upon many factors, including negotiations  
with taxing authorities. In certain jurisdictions, we must pay a 
portion of the disputed amount to the local government in 
order to formally appeal an assessment. Such payment is 
recorded as a receivable if we believe the amount is collectible.

A valuation allowance is provided for those deferred 

income tax assets for which the weight of available evidence 
suggests that the related benefits will not be realized. In 
determining the amount of the valuation allowance, we consider 
estimated future taxable income or loss as well as feasible  
tax planning strategies in each jurisdiction. If we determine 
that we will not realize all or a portion of our deferred 
income tax assets, we will increase our valuation allowance. 
Conversely, if we determine that we will ultimately be able to 
realize all or a portion of the related benefits for which a 
valuation allowance has been provided, all or a portion of the 
related valuation allowance will be reduced.

Revenues

Mining Operations

Consolidated revenues totaled $16.4 billion in 2017, $14.8 billion 
in 2016 and $14.6 billion in 2015. Revenues from our mining 
operations primarily include the sale of copper concentrate, 
copper cathode, copper rod, gold and molybdenum. Revenue 
from our oil and gas operations include the sale of oil, natural 
gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs). Following is a summary

Sales Volumes. Consolidated copper sales volumes totaled  
3.7 billion pounds in 2017, 4.2 billion pounds in 2016 and  
3.6 billion pounds in 2015. Lower copper sales volumes in 2017, 
compared to 2016, primarily reflect lower sales volumes in 
North America mainly caused by lower ore grades. Higher 
copper sales volumes in 2016, compared to 2015, primarily 
reflect higher volumes from Cerro Verde and PT-FI; partly 
offset by lower sales volumes in North America, primarily 
reflecting reduced mining rates and the impact of the May 2016 
sale of an additional 13 percent undivided interest in Morenci.

Consolidated gold sales volumes totaled 1.6 million ounces 

in 2017, 1.1 million ounces in 2016 and 1.25 million ounces in 
2015. Higher gold sales volumes in 2017, compared with 2016, 
primarily reflect higher ore grades at PT-FI. Lower gold sales 
volumes in 2016, compared with 2015, primarily reflect lower 
ore grades at PT-FI.

Consolidated molybdenum sales volumes totaled 95 million 

pounds in 2017, 74 million pounds in 2016 and 89 million 
pounds in 2015. Higher molybdenum sales volumes in 2017, 
compared with 2016, primarily reflect increased demand and 
higher production. Lower molybdenum sales volumes in 2016, 
compared with 2015, primarily reflect reduced operating rates 
in response to weak demand.

Refer to “Operations” for further discussion of sales volumes 

at our operating divisions.

2017 Annual Report

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS

Metals Realized Prices. Our consolidated revenues can vary 
significantly as a result of fluctuations in the market prices of 
copper, gold and molybdenum. Our average realized prices 
were 29 percent higher for copper, 2 percent higher for gold 
and 12 percent higher for molybdenum in 2017, compared  
with 2016. In 2016, our average realized prices were 6 percent 
lower for copper, 10 percent higher for gold and 4 percent 
lower for molybdenum, compared with 2015.

Provisionally Priced Copper Sales. Impacts of net adjustments 

for prior year provisionally priced sales primarily relate to 
copper sales. Substantially all of our copper concentrate and 
cathode sales contracts provide final copper pricing in a 
specified future month (generally one to four months from the 
shipment date) based primarily on quoted LME monthly 
average spot copper prices (refer to “Disclosures About 
Market Risks — Commodity Price Risk” for further discussion). 
Revenues include favorable (unfavorable) net adjustments 
to prior years’ provisionally priced copper sales totaling  
$81 million in 2017, $5 million in 2016 and $(100) million  
in 2015.

Purchased Copper. We purchased copper cathode primarily 

for processing by our Rod & Refining operations. Purchased 
copper volumes totaled 273 million pounds in 2017, 188 million 
pounds in 2016 and 121 million pounds in 2015.

Atlantic Copper Revenues. Atlantic Copper revenues totaled 
$2.0 billion in 2017, $1.8 billion in 2016 and $2.0 billion in 2015. 
Higher Atlantic Copper revenues in 2017, compared with 2016, 
primarily reflect higher copper prices. Lower Atlantic Copper 
revenues in 2016, compared with 2015, primarily reflect lower 
copper prices.

Oil & Gas Operations

Oil Sales Volumes. Oil sales volumes totaled 1.8 million barrels 
(MMBbls) in 2017, 34.4 MMBbls in 2016 and 35.3 MMBbls in 
2015. Lower volumes in 2017, compared with 2016 and 2015, 
reflect the sale of substantially all of our oil and gas properties 
in late 2016. Refer to “Operations” for further discussion of 
sales volumes at our oil and gas operations.

Realized Oil Prices Excluding Derivative Contracts. Our 

average realized price per barrel for oil (excluding the impact 
of derivative contracts) of $40.71 in 2017 was 4 percent higher 
than our average realized price of $38.96 in 2016. Our average 
realized price for oil (excluding the impact of derivative 
contracts) of $38.96 in 2016 was 15 percent lower than our 
average realized price of $45.58 per barrel for 2015.

Oil and Gas Derivative Contracts. During 2016 and 2015, we 
had derivative contracts that were not designated as hedging 
instruments; accordingly, they were recorded at fair value with 
the mark-to-market gains and losses recorded in revenues 

each period (refer to Note 14 for further discussion of oil and 
gas derivative contracts). Net mark-to-market (losses) gains 
on oil and gas derivative contracts totaled $(35) million in 
2016 and $87 million in 2015. We did not have any oil and gas 
derivative contracts in 2017 and do not have any in place for 
future periods.

Production and Delivery Costs

Consolidated production and delivery costs totaled $10.3 billion 
in 2017 and $10.7 billion in both 2016 and 2015. Lower 
production and delivery costs in 2017, compared to 2016, 
primarily reflected lower costs related to our oil and gas 
operations because of the sale of substantially all of our oil 
and gas properties in late 2016, partly offset by charges of 
$203 million in 2017 related to disputed Cerro Verde royalties 
for prior years (refer to Note 12 for further discussion) and 
charges of $120 million at PT-FI for workforce reductions.

Production and delivery costs in 2016, compared to 2015, 

reflected lower costs associated with the impact of cost 
reduction initiatives, offset by higher charges for drillship 
settlements/idle rig and contract termination costs at U.S.  
oil and gas operations (which totaled $926 million in 2016, 
compared to $26 million in 2015).

Mining Unit Site Production and Delivery Costs

Site production and delivery costs for our copper mining 
operations primarily include labor, energy and commodity-
based inputs, such as sulphuric acid, reagents, liners, tires and 
explosives. Consolidated unit site production and delivery 
costs (before net noncash and other costs) for our copper mines 
averaged $1.61 per pound of copper in 2017, $1.42 per pound  
in 2016 and $1.81 per pound in 2015. Higher consolidated unit 
site production and delivery costs in 2017, compared with 
2016, primarily reflected lower consolidated copper sales 
volumes and higher mining, milling and employee costs  
at our South America mining operations. Lower consolidated 
unit site production and delivery costs in 2016, compared  
with 2015, primarily reflected higher copper sales volumes and 
the impact of cost reduction initiatives. Refer to “Operations— 
Unit Net Cash Costs” for further discussion of unit net cash 
costs associated with our operating divisions, and to “Product 
Revenues and Production Costs” for reconciliations of per 
pound costs by operating division to production and delivery 
costs applicable to sales reported in our consolidated 
financial statements.

Our copper mining operations require significant amounts 

of energy, principally diesel, electricity, coal and natural gas, 
most of which is obtained from third parties under long-term 
contracts. Energy represented 18 percent of our copper  
mine site operating costs in 2017, including purchases of 

34

Freeport-McMoRan

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS

approximately 196 million gallons of diesel fuel; 7,900 gigawatt 
hours of electricity at our North America and South America 
copper mining operations (we generate all of our power at our 
Indonesia mining operation); 700 thousand metric tons of  
coal for our coal power plant in Indonesia; and 1 million MMBtu 
(million British thermal units) of natural gas at certain of our 
North America mines. Based on current cost estimates, energy 
will approximate 20 percent of our copper mine site operating 
costs for 2018.

Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization

Depreciation will vary under the UOP method as a result of 
changes in sales volumes and the related UOP rates at our 
mining operations. Consolidated DD&A totaled $1.7 billion in 
2017, $2.5 billion in 2016 and $3.2 billion in 2015. Lower 
DD&A in 2017, compared with 2016, primarily reflected the 
impact of the sale of substantially all of our oil and gas 
properties in late 2016. Lower DD&A in 2016, compared with 
2015, primarily reflected lower DD&A rates as a result of 
impairment of oil and gas properties, partly offset by higher 
DD&A at the Cerro Verde mine.

Impairment of Oil and Gas Properties

Under the full cost accounting rules, we recognized impairment 
charges totaling $4.3 billion in 2016 and $13.0 billion in 2015  
for U.S. oil and gas properties. We also recognized impairment 
charges of $18 million in 2016 and $164 million in 2015 for 
international oil and gas properties, primarily related to Morocco. 
Refer to Note 1 for further discussion.

Mining Exploration and Research Expenses

Consolidated exploration and research expenses for our 
mining operations totaled $94 million in 2017, $64 million in 
2016 and $107 million in 2015. Our mining exploration activities 
are generally associated with our existing mines and focus  
on opportunities to expand reserves and resources to support 
development of additional future production capacity. 
Exploration results continue to indicate opportunities for 
significant future potential reserve additions in North America 
and South America. Exploration spending is expected to 
approximate $65 million in 2018.

Environmental Obligations and Shutdown Costs

Environmental obligation costs reflect net revisions to our 
long-term environmental obligations, which vary from period 
to period because of changes to environmental laws and 
regulations, the settlement of environmental matters and/or 
circumstances affecting our operations that could result in 
significant changes in our estimates (refer to “Critical 
Accounting Estimates—Environmental Obligations” for further 
discussion). Shutdown costs include care-and-maintenance 
costs and any litigation, remediation or related expenditures 
associated with closed facilities or operations. Net charges  
for environmental obligations and shutdown costs totaled 
$251 million in 2017, $20 million in 2016 and $78 million  
in 2015. Higher costs in 2017 primarily reflect adjustments  
to environmental obligations resulting from revised  
cost estimates. Refer to Note 12 for further discussion of 
environmental obligations and litigation matters.

Metals Inventory Adjustments

Net Gain on Sales of Assets

We recorded adjustments to copper and molybdenum 
inventory carrying values totaling $8 million in 2017, $36 million 
in 2016 and $338 million in 2015. Refer to Notes 1 and 4 for 
further discussion.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses 
totaled $484 million in 2017, $607 million in 2016 and  
$558 million in 2015. Selling, general and administrative 
expenses included $17 million in 2017 for oil and gas contract 
termination costs, $85 million in 2016 for oil and gas 
restructuring costs and $18 million in 2015 for executive 
retirement benefits.

Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses 
were net of capitalized general and administrative expenses  
at our oil and gas operations totaling $78 million in 2016 and 
$124 million in 2015.

Net gain on sales of assets totaled $81 million in 2017, primarily 
associated with oil and gas transactions and adjustments to 
assets held for sale.

Net gain on sales of assets totaled $649 million in 2016, 

primarily related to the gains recognized for the Morenci and 
Timok transactions, partly offset by estimated losses on assets 
held for sale. Net gain on sales of assets for the year 2016 also 
included $183 million for contingent consideration, including 
$150 million associated with the sale of the Deepwater Gulf of 
Mexico (GOM) oil and gas properties, which is payable to us  
as the buyer realizes future cash flows in connection with a third- 
party production handling agreement, and $33 million for the 
fair value of the potential $150 million in contingent consideration 
from the sale of the onshore California oil and gas properties, 
which in accordance with accounting guidelines will continue to 
be adjusted to fair value through December 31, 2020.

Net gain on sales of assets totaled $39 million in 2015 related 

to the sale of our one-third interest in the Luna Energy power 
facility in New Mexico.

Refer to Note 2 for further discussion of dispositions.

AND ANALYSIS

Interest Expense, Net

Interest expense, net, includes $145 million in 2017 associated 
with disputed Cerro Verde royalties (refer to Note 12 for further 
discussion). Consolidated interest costs (before capitalization, 
excluding interest expense associated with disputed Cerro 
Verde royalties) totaled $777 million in 2017, $854 million in 
2016 and $832 million in 2015. Lower interest expense in 2017, 
compared to 2016, reflects a decrease in total debt.

Capitalized interest varies with the level of expenditures for 

our development projects and average interest rates on our 
borrowings, and totaled $121 million in 2017, $99 million in 2016 
and $215 million in 2015. Refer to “Operations” and “Capital 
Resources and Liquidity—Investing Activities” for further 
discussion of current development projects.

debt totaled $26 million in 2016, primarily related to the 
redemption of certain senior notes in exchange for common 
stock, partly offset by losses associated with prepayments of 
an unsecured bank term loan and fees associated with the 
exchange of Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas LLC senior notes for 
new FCX senior notes. Refer to Note 8 for further discussion.

Other Income, Net

Other income, net, primarily included foreign currency 
translation adjustments and interest income, and totaled  
$49 million in both 2017 and 2016, and $1 million in 2015. The 
year 2015 also included a gain of $92 million associated with  
net proceeds received from insurance carriers and other third 
parties related to the shareholder derivative litigation.

Net Gain on Early Extinguishment and Exchanges  
of Debt

Net gain on early extinguishment of debt totaled $21 million

a.  Represents income (loss) from continuing operations by geographic location before income taxes and equity in affiliated companies’ net earnings.
b.  Includes net tax credits of $24 million associated with changes in valuation allowances; also includes net tax credits of $21 million associated with AMT credit carryforwards. These credits are not related to the 

benefit resulting from U.S. tax reform presented separately in the above table (refer to footnote e below).

c.  Includes tax credits of $357 million associated with AMT credits, changes to valuation allowances and net operating loss carryback claims.
d.  Includes a net tax credit of $13 million ($17 million net of noncontrolling interests) related to changes in Peruvian tax rules.
e.  As further discussed in Note 11, the Act enacted on December 22, 2017, includes significant modifications to existing U.S. tax laws and creates many new complex tax provisions. The Act reduces the corporate 

income tax rate to 21 percent, eliminates the corporate AMT, provides for a refund of AMT credit carryover, maintains hard minerals percentage depletion, allows for immediate expensing of certain qualified 
property and generally broadens the tax base. The Act also creates a territorial tax system (with a one-time mandatory tax on previously deferred foreign earnings), creates anti-base erosion rules that require 
companies to pay a minimum tax on foreign earnings and disallows certain payments from U.S. corporations to foreign related parties. Our income tax provision for the year 2017 includes provisional net tax 
credits associated with the Act totaling $393 million, including the reversal of valuation allowances associated with anticipated refunds of AMT credits over the next four years ($272 million, net of reserves) and a 
decrease in corporate income tax rates ($121 million). Our income tax provision for the year 2017 was not impacted by the Act’s one-time tax on deferred foreign earnings, as we have sufficient foreign tax credits  
to offset the tax. As the Act’s tax provisions are numerous and complex, we continue to evaluate their impact.
Includes tax charges of $136 million for disputed royalties and other related mining taxes for the period October 2011 through the year 2013, mostly offset by a tax benefit of $129 million associated with disputed 
royalties and other related mining taxes for the period December 2006 through the year 2013.

g.  Net of tax charges to establish valuation allowances against U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets that will not generate a future benefit.
h.  Includes a gain of $92 million related to net proceeds received from insurance carriers and other third parties related to the shareholder derivative litigation settlement for which there was no related tax provision.

Our consolidated effective income tax rate is a function  
of the combined effective tax rates for the jurisdictions in  
which we operate. Accordingly, variations in the relative 
proportions of jurisdictional income result in fluctuations to 
our consolidated effective income tax rate. Assuming 
achievement of current sales volume and cost estimates and 
average prices of $3.15 per pound for copper, $1,300 per 
ounce for gold and $10.00 per pound for molybdenum for 
2018, we estimate our consolidated effective tax rate for the 
year 2018 will approximate 37 percent and would decrease 
with higher prices.

Refer to Note 11 for further discussion of income taxes.

Net Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations

As further discussed in Note 2, in November 2016, we 
completed the sale of our interest in TFHL, through which  
we had an effective 56 percent interest in the Tenke copper 
and cobalt concessions in the Democratic Republic of Congo. 
In accordance with accounting guidelines, the results of  
TFHL have been reported as discontinued operations for all 
periods presented.

Net income from discontinued operations totaled $66 million 

in 2017, primarily reflecting adjustments to the fair value of  
the potential $120 million contingent consideration related to 
the sale, which totaled $74 million at December 31, 2017,  
and will continue to be adjusted through December 31, 2019. 
Net (loss) income from discontinued operations of $(193) million 
in 2016 and $91 million in 2015 included allocated interest 
expense of $39 million in 2016 and $28 million in 2015 associated 
with the portion of the term loan that was required to be repaid 
as a result of the sale of our interest in TFHL. The year 2016 
also included $198 million for the estimated loss on disposal.

Gain on Redemption and Preferred Dividends 
Attributable to Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest

In connection with the December 2016 sale of the Deepwater 
GOM oil and gas properties, we settled a preferred stock 
obligation at our Plains Offshore subsidiary, which resulted in 
the recognition of a $199 million gain on redemption. Refer  
to Note 2 for further discussion.

OPERATIONS
North America Copper Mines

We operate seven open-pit copper mines in North America—
Morenci, Bagdad, Safford, Sierrita and Miami in Arizona, and 
Chino and Tyrone in New Mexico. All of the North America 
mining operations are wholly owned, except for Morenci.

We record our undivided joint venture interest in Morenci 

using the proportionate consolidation method. On May 31, 
2016, we completed the sale of an additional 13 percent 
undivided interest in Morenci. As a result of the transaction, 
our undivided interest in Morenci was prospectively  
reduced from 85 percent to 72 percent. Refer to Note 2 for 
further discussion.

The North America copper mines include open-pit mining, 

sulfide ore concentrating, leaching and solution extraction/
electrowinning (SX/EW) operations. A majority of the copper 
produced at our North America copper mines is cast into 
copper rod by our Rod & Refining segment. The remainder of 
our North America copper sales is in the form of copper 
cathode or copper concentrate, a portion of which is shipped to 
Atlantic Copper (our wholly owned smelter). Molybdenum 
concentrate, gold and silver are also produced by certain of 
our North America copper mines.

Operating and Development Activities. We have significant 

undeveloped reserves and resources in North America  
and a portfolio of potential long-term development projects. 
Future investments will be undertaken based on the results  
of economic and technical feasibility studies, and are dependent 
on market conditions. We continue to study opportunities to 
reduce the capital intensity of our potential long-term 
development projects.

Through exploration drilling, we have identified a significant 

resource at our wholly owned Lone Star project located near 
the Safford operation in eastern Arizona. We have commenced 
a project to develop the Lone Star oxide ores with first 
production expected by the end of 2020. Total estimated 
capital costs, including mine equipment and pre-production 
stripping, approximate $850 million and will benefit from  
the utilization of existing infrastructure at the adjacent Safford 
operation. Production from the Lone Star oxide ores is 
expected to average approximately 200 million pounds of 
copper per year with an approximate 20-year mine life.  
The project also advances the potential for development of a 
larger-scale district opportunity. We are conducting additional 
drilling as we continue to evaluate longer term opportunities 
available from the significant sulfide potential in the Lone Star/
Safford minerals district.

a.  Refer to “Consolidated Results” for our consolidated molybdenum sales volumes, which include 

sales of molybdenum produced at the North America copper mines.

Copper sales volumes from our North America copper mines 
decreased to 1.5 billion pounds in 2017, compared with  
1.8 billion pounds in 2016, primarily reflecting lower ore grades. 
The year 2016 included approximately 60 million pounds of 

copper from the 13 percent undivided interest in Morenci that 
we sold in May 2016.

Copper sales volumes from our North America copper 

mines decreased to 1.8 billion pounds in 2016, compared with 
2.0 billion pounds in 2015, primarily reflecting the impact  
of the May 2016 sale of an additional 13 percent undivided 
interest in Morenci and reduced mining rates.

North America copper sales are estimated to approximate 

1.5 billion pounds of copper in 2018. Refer to “Outlook” for 
projected molybdenum sales volumes.

Unit Net Cash Costs. Unit net cash costs per pound of 
copper is a measure intended to provide investors with 
information about the cash-generating capacity of our mining 
operations expressed on a basis relating to the primary metal 
product for our respective operations. We use this measure 
for the same purpose and for monitoring operating 
performance by our mining operations. This information differs 
from measures of performance determined in accordance  
with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as 
a substitute for measures of performance determined in 
accordance with U.S. GAAP. This measure is presented by 
other metals mining companies, although our measure  
may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported 
by other companies.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS

Our North America copper mines have varying cost structures 
because of differences in ore grades and characteristics, 
processing costs, by-product credits and other factors. During 
2017, average unit net cash costs (net of by-product credits) 
for the North America copper mines ranged from $1.32 per 
pound to $2.35 per pound at the individual mines and averaged 
$1.57 per pound. Higher average unit net cash costs (net of 
by-product credits) in 2017, compared with $1.41 per pound in 
2016, primarily reflected lower copper sales volumes.

Because certain assets are depreciated on a straight-line 

basis, North America’s average unit depreciation rate may 

vary with asset additions and the level of copper production 
and sales.

Average unit net cash costs (net of by-product credits) for 

our North America copper mines are expected to approximate 
$1.67 per pound of copper in 2018, based on achievement  
of current sales volume and cost estimates, and assuming an 
average molybdenum price of $10.00 per pound. North 
America’s average unit net cash costs in 2018 would change 
by approximately $0.04 per pound for each $2 per pound 
change in the average price of molybdenum.

America copper mines decreased to $1.41 per pound of copper 
in 2016, compared with $1.67 per pound in 2015, primarily 
reflecting cost reduction initiatives.

South America Mining

We operate two copper mines in South America—Cerro Verde 
in Peru (in which we own a 53.56 percent interest) and El Abra 
in Chile (in which we own a 51 percent interest), which are 
consolidated in our financial statements.

South America mining includes open-pit mining, sulfide ore 

concentrating, leaching and SX/EW operations. Production 
from our South America mines is sold as copper concentrate 
or cathode under long-term contracts. Our South America 
mines also sell a portion of their copper concentrate and 
cathode to Atlantic Copper. In addition to copper, the Cerro 
Verde mine produces molybdenum concentrate and silver.

Operating and Development Activities. The Cerro Verde 

expansion project, which commenced operations in 
September 2015, achieved capacity operating rates in early 
2016. The project expanded the concentrator facilities’ 
capacity from 120,000 metric tons of ore per day to 360,000 
metric tons of ore per day. Cerro Verde’s expanded 
operations benefit from its large-scale, long-lived reserves  
and cost efficiencies.

Beginning in the second half of 2015, El Abra operated at 

reduced rates to achieve lower operating and labor costs, 
defer capital expenditures and extend the life of the existing 
operations. El Abra is expected to operate at full capacity 
during 2018.

Exploration results in recent years at El Abra indicate a 

significant sulfide resource, which could potentially support a 
major mill project similar to facilities recently constructed  
at Cerro Verde. We continue to evaluate a potential major 
expansion at El Abra to process additional sulfide material and 
to achieve higher recoveries. Future investments will depend 
on technical studies, which are being advanced, economic 
factors and market conditions.

primarily reflected lower recovery rates at Cerro Verde and 
lower ore grades at El Abra.

operations totaled 1.3 billion pounds in 2016, and were higher 
compared with 871 million pounds in 2015, primarily reflecting 
Cerro Verde’s expanded operations.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS

During 2017, unit net cash costs (net of by-product credits)  
for the South America mines were $1.58 per pound of copper 
for the Cerro Verde mine and $2.00 per pound for the El Abra 
mine, and averaged $1.64 per pound. Higher average unit net 
cash costs (net of by-product credits) for our South America 
mining operations in 2017, compared with $1.41 per pound in 
2016, primarily reflected lower sales volumes and higher mining, 
milling and employee costs at Cerro Verde, partly offset by 
higher by-product credits.

current mine plans, PT-FI anticipates that it will be allocated 
most of the production and related revenues and costs 
through 2022.

PT-FI produces copper concentrate that contains significant 

quantities of gold and silver. Substantially all of PT-FI’s 
copper concentrate is sold under long-term contracts, and in 
2017, approximately 46 percent of PT-FI’s copper concentrate 
was sold to PT Smelting (PT-FI’s 25 percent-owned smelter 
and refinery in Gresik, Indonesia).

Unit net cash costs (net of by-product credits) for our 

Regulatory Matters. Following the issuance of new 

South America mining operations decreased to $1.41 per 
pound of copper in 2016, compared with $1.74 per pound in 
2015, primarily reflecting higher copper sales volumes and 
efficiencies associated with the Cerro Verde expansion.

Revenues from Cerro Verde’s concentrate sales are recorded 

net of treatment charges, which will vary with Cerro Verde’s 
sales volumes and the price of copper.

Because certain assets are depreciated on a straight-line 

basis, South America’s unit depreciation rate may vary with asset 
additions and the level of copper production and sales.

Revenue adjustments primarily result from changes in prices 

on provisionally priced copper sales recognized in prior 
periods. Refer to “Consolidated Results—Revenues” for further 
discussion of adjustments to prior period provisionally priced 
copper sales.

Average unit net cash costs (net of by-product credits) for 

our South America mining operations are expected to 
approximate $1.63 per pound of copper in 2018, based on 
current sales volume and cost estimates, and assuming

Indonesia mining includes PT-FI’s Grasberg minerals district, 
one of the world’s largest copper and gold deposits, in  
Papua, Indonesia. We own 90.64 percent of PT-FI, including 
9.36 percent owned through our wholly owned subsidiary,  
PT Indocopper Investama.

PT-FI proportionately consolidates an unincorporated joint 

venture with Rio Tinto plc (Rio Tinto), under which Rio Tinto 
has a 40 percent interest in certain assets and a 40 percent 
interest through 2022 in production exceeding specified 
annual amounts of copper, gold and silver. After 2022, all 
production and related revenues and costs are shared 60 percent 
PT-FI and 40 percent Rio Tinto. Refer to Note 3 for further 
discussion of our joint venture with Rio Tinto. Under the joint 
venture arrangements, PT-FI was allocated nearly 100 percent 
of copper, gold and silver production and sales for each of  
the three years ended December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2017, 
the amounts allocated 100 percent to PT-FI remaining to be 
produced totaled 4.7 billion pounds of copper, 7.1 million 
ounces of gold and 12.7 million ounces of silver. Based on the 

regulations by the Indonesian government in early 2017 (which 
resulted in a temporary suspension of PT-FI’s concentrate 
exports), PT-FI entered into a Memorandum of Understanding 
in April 2017 confirming that the COW would continue to be 
valid and honored until replaced by a mutually agreed IUPK 
and investment stability agreement.

Following a framework understanding reached in August 

2017, the parties have been engaged in negotiation and 
documentation of an IUPK and accompanying documentation 
for assurances on legal and fiscal terms to replace the COW 
while providing PT-FI with long-term mining rights through 
2041. In addition, the IUPK would provide that PT-FI construct 
a smelter within five years of reaching a definitive agreement 
and include agreement for the divestment of 51 percent of the 
project area interests to Indonesian participants at fair market 
value. The parties continue to negotiate documentation on  
a comprehensive agreement for PT-FI’s extended operations 
and to reach agreement on timing, process and governance 
matters relating to the divestment, with a mutual objective of 
completing negotiations and the required documentation 
during the first half of 2018.

In December 2017, PT-FI was granted an extension of  

its temporary IUPK through June 30, 2018, to enable exports 
to continue while negotiations on a definitive agreement 
proceed. In February 2018, PT-FI received an extension of its 
export license through February 15, 2019.

Until a definitive agreement is reached, PT-FI has reserved all 

rights under its COW, including dispute resolution procedures. 
We cannot predict whether PT-FI will be successful in reaching 
a satisfactory agreement on the terms of its long-term mining 
rights. If PT-FI is unable to reach a definitive agreement with 
the Indonesian government on its long-term mining rights, we 
intend to reduce or defer investments significantly in 
underground development projects and will pursue dispute 
resolution procedures under PT-FI’s COW. Refer to Note 13 and 
“Risk Factors” contained in Part I, Item 1A. of our annual report 
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, for 
further discussion of these regulatory matters and risks 
associated with operations in Indonesia.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS

Refer to Note 12 for discussion of Indonesia tax matters, 

including surface water tax assessments that PT-FI is seeking 
to address in connection with the ongoing negotiations to 
resolve PT-FI’s long-term mining rights.

Operating and Development Activities. PT-FI is currently 

mining the final phase of the Grasberg open pit, which 
contains high copper and gold ore grades. PT-FI expects to 
mine high-grade ore over the next several quarters prior to 
transitioning to the Grasberg Block Cave underground mine in 
the first half of 2019.

PT-FI has several projects in the Grasberg minerals district 

related to the development of its large-scale, long-lived, 
high-grade underground ore bodies. In aggregate, these 
underground ore bodies are expected to produce large-scale 
quantities of copper and gold following the transition from  
the Grasberg open pit. Substantial progress has been made to 
prepare for the transition to mining of the Grasberg Block 
Cave underground mine. Mine development activities are 
sufficiently advanced to commence caving in early 2019. The 
ore flow system and underground rail line are expected to  
be installed during 2018.

Subject to reaching a definitive agreement to support 

PT-FI’s long-term investment plans, estimated annual capital 
spending on these projects would average $0.9 billion per  
year ($0.7 billion per year net to PT-FI) over the next five years. 
Considering the long-term nature and size of these projects, 
actual costs could vary from these estimates. In response to 
market conditions and Indonesian regulatory uncertainty,  
the timing of these expenditures continues to be reviewed. If 
PT-FI is unable to reach a definitive agreement with the 
Indonesian government on its long-term mining rights, we 
intend to reduce or defer investments significantly in 
underground development projects and will pursue dispute 
resolution procedures under PT-FI’s COW.

The following provides additional information on the 

continued development of the Common Infrastructure project, 
the Grasberg Block Cave underground mine and the Deep Mill 
Level Zone (DMLZ) ore body that lies below the Deep Ore 
Zone (DOZ) underground mine. Our current plans and mineral 
reserves in Indonesia assume that PT-FI’s long-term mining 
rights will be extended through 2041, as stated in the COW.

bodies. The tunnel system was completed to the Big Gossan 
terminal, and the Big Gossan mine was first brought into 
production in 2010. The Big Gossan underground mine was  
on care-and-maintenance status during most of 2017 and 
production restarted in fourth-quarter 2017. Development of 
the DMLZ and Grasberg Block Cave underground mines is 
advancing using the Common Infrastructure project tunnels  
as access.

The Grasberg Block Cave underground mine accounts for 
approximately half of our recoverable proven and probable 
reserves in Indonesia. Production from the Grasberg Block Cave 
mine is expected to commence in early 2019, following the 
end of mining of the Grasberg open pit. Targeted production 
rates once the Grasberg Block Cave mining operation reaches 
full capacity are expected to approximate 130,000 to 160,000 
metric tons of ore per day. PT-FI continues to review its 
operating plans to determine the optimum mine plan for the 
Grasberg Block Cave underground mine.

Aggregate mine development capital for the Grasberg 

Block Cave mine and associated Common Infrastructure is 
expected to approximate $6.4 billion (incurred between 2008 
to 2023), with PT-FI’s share totaling approximately $5.9 billion. 
Aggregate project costs totaling $3.3 billion have been 
incurred through December 31, 2017 ($0.5 billion during 2017).

DMLZ. The DMLZ ore body lies below the DOZ mine at  
the 2,590-meter elevation and represents the downward 
continuation of mineralization in the Ertsberg East Skarn 
system and neighboring Ertsberg porphyry. In September 2015, 
PT-FI initiated pre-commercial production that represents  
ore extracted during the development phase for the purpose 
of obtaining access to the ore body. During 2017 and late 
January 2018, the DMLZ underground mine was impacted by 
mining-seismic activity, which is not uncommon in block cave 
mining. To mitigate the impact of these events, PT-FI 
implemented a revised mine sequence; upgraded support 
systems, blasting and re-entry protocols; and improved mine 
monitoring and analysis processes. Development activities and 
mining are taking place in unaffected areas while impacted 
areas are being assessed, rehabilitated and prepared to be 
placed back into use. PT-FI expects DMLZ to ramp up to full 
capacity of 80,000 metric tons of ore per day in 2021.

Common Infrastructure and Grasberg Block Cave Mine. In 

Drilling efforts continue to determine the extent of the  

2004, PT-FI commenced its Common Infrastructure project  
to provide access to its large undeveloped underground ore 
bodies located in the Grasberg minerals district through a 
tunnel system located approximately 400 meters deeper than 
its existing underground tunnel system. In addition to 
providing access to our underground ore bodies, the tunnel 
system will enable PT-FI to conduct future exploration in 
prospective areas associated with currently identified ore 

ore body. Aggregate mine development capital costs for the 
DMLZ underground mine are expected to approximate  
$3.1 billion (incurred between 2009 and 2021), with PT-FI’s 
share totaling approximately $1.9 billion. Aggregate project 
costs totaling $2.1 billion have been incurred through 
December 31, 2017 ($0.3 billion during 2017).

a.  Amounts represent the approximate average daily throughput processed at PT-FI’s mill facilities from 

each producing mine and from development activities that result in metal production.

Sales volumes from our Indonesia mining operations totaled 
981 million pounds of copper and 1.5 million ounces of gold in 
2017, compared with 1.1 billion pounds of copper and 1.1 million 
ounces of gold in 2016. Lower copper sales in 2017, 
compared to 2016, primarily reflected the impact of regulatory 
restrictions on PT-FI’s concentrate exports at the beginning  
of 2017 (see discussion above in “Regulatory Matters”), partly 
offset by higher copper ore grades. Higher gold sales 
volumes in 2017 primarily reflected higher gold ore grades.

Sales volumes from our Indonesia mining operations totaled 

1.1 billion pounds of copper and 1.1 million ounces of gold in 
2016, compared with 744 million pounds of copper and 1.2 million 
ounces of gold in 2015. Higher copper sales volumes in 2016 
primarily reflected higher copper ore grades. Lower gold sales 
volumes in 2016 primarily reflected lower gold ore grades.

2018, consolidated sales volumes from Indonesia mining  
are expected to approximate 1.2 billion pounds of copper and  
2.4 million ounces of gold in 2018. Indonesia mining’s 
projected sales volumes in 2018 are dependent on a number 
of factors, including operational performance, workforce 
productivity, the timing of shipments and whether PT-FI will be 
able to resolve complex regulatory matters in Indonesia and 
continue to operate after June 30, 2018.

Unit Net Cash Costs. Unit net cash costs per pound of 

copper is a measure intended to provide investors with 
information about the cash-generating capacity of our mining 
operations expressed on a basis relating to the primary metal 
product for our respective operations. We use this measure for 
the same purpose and for monitoring operating performance  
by our mining operations. This information differs from measures 
of performance determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP 
and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for 
measures of performance determined in accordance with  
U.S. GAAP. This measure is presented by other metal mining 
companies, although our measure may not be comparable  
to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

a.  Includes $120 million ($0.12 per pound of copper) of costs charged directly to production and delivery costs as a result of workforce reductions.

A significant portion of PT-FI’s costs are fixed, and unit costs 
vary depending on volumes and other factors. As a result  
of higher gold and silver credits, Indonesia had unit net cash 
costs (including gold and silver credits) of $0.09 per pound of 
copper in 2017, compared with $0.83 per pound in 2016.

Revenue adjustments primarily result from changes in prices 

on provisionally priced copper sales recognized in prior 
periods. Refer to “Consolidated Results—Revenues” for further 
discussion of adjustments to prior period provisionally priced 
copper sales.

Treatment charges vary with the volume of metals sold and 

PT Smelting intercompany loss represents the change in  

the price of copper, and royalties vary with the volume of 
metals sold and the prices of copper and gold.

PT-FI’s export duties totaled $115 million in 2017, $95 million 

in 2016 and $109 million in 2015. PT-FI’s royalties totaled  
$173 million in 2017, $131 million in 2016 and $114 million in 2015. 
Refer to Note 13 for further discussion of PT-FI’s export duties 
and royalties.

Higher DD&A in 2017, compared with 2016, primarily related 

to higher amortization of asset retirement costs associated 
with revised estimates at the end of 2016 for an overburden 
stockpile. Because certain assets are depreciated on a 
straight-line basis, PT-FI’s unit depreciation rate varies with  
the level of copper production and sales.

the deferral of 25 percent of PT-FI’s profit on sales to  
PT Smelting. Refer to “Operations—Smelting & Refining” for 
further discussion.

Assuming an average gold price of $1,300 per ounce for 

2018 and achievement of the sales volume and cost estimates, 
unit net cash credits (net of gold and silver credits) for 
Indonesia mining are expected to approximate $0.57 per pound 
of copper in 2018. Indonesia mining’s unit net cash credits  
for 2018 would change by approximately $0.09 per pound for 
each $50 per ounce change in the average price of gold. 
Because of the fixed nature of a large portion of Indonesia’s 
costs, unit net cash credits/costs vary from quarter to 
quarter depending on copper and gold volumes.

Unit net cash costs (net of gold and silver credits) for our 
Indonesia mining operations of $0.83 per pound of copper  
in 2016 were lower than unit net cash costs of $1.09 per 
pound in 2015, primarily reflecting higher copper sales volumes, 
partly offset by lower gold and silver credits.

Molybdenum Mines

We have two wholly owned molybdenum mines—the 
Henderson underground mine and the Climax open-pit mine, 
both in Colorado. The Henderson and Climax mines produce 
high-purity, chemical-grade molybdenum concentrate, which 
is typically further processed into value-added molybdenum 
chemical products. The majority of the molybdenum 
concentrate produced at the Henderson and Climax mines,  
as well as from our North America and South America copper 
mines, is processed at our own conversion facilities.

Operating and Development Activities. In response to 

market conditions, the Henderson molybdenum mine continues 
to operate at reduced rates.

Production from the Molybdenum mines totaled 32 million 

pounds of molybdenum in 2017, 26 million pounds in 2016 and 
48 million pounds in 2015. Refer to “Consolidated Results”  
for our consolidated molybdenum operating data, which 
includes sales of molybdenum produced at our Molybdenum 
mines, and from our North America and South America copper 
mines, and refer to “Outlook” for projected consolidated 
molybdenum sales volumes.

Unit Net Cash Costs Per Pound of Molybdenum. Unit net 

cash costs per pound of molybdenum is a measure intended to 
provide investors with information about the cash-generating 
capacity of our mining operations expressed on a basis 
relating to the primary metal product for our respective 
operations. We use this measure for the same purpose and for 

monitoring operating performance by our mining operations. 
This information differs from measures of performance 
determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be 
considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of 
performance determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This 
measure is presented by other metals mining companies, 
although our measure may not be comparable to similarly 
titled measures reported by other companies.

Average unit net cash costs for our molybdenum mines 

totaled $7.79 per pound of molybdenum in 2017, $8.36 per 
pound in 2016 and $7.11 per pound in 2015. The decrease  
in the average unit net cash costs for molybdenum in 2017, 
compared to 2016, primarily reflected higher sales volumes. 
The increase in the average unit net cash costs for 
molybdenum in 2016, compared to 2015, primarily reflected 
lower volumes. Assuming achievement of current sales  
volume and cost estimates, we estimate unit net cash costs 
for the Molybdenum mines to average $9.00 per pound of 
molybdenum in 2018. Refer to “Product Revenues and 
Production Costs” for a reconciliation of unit net cash costs 
per pound to production and delivery costs applicable to  
sales reported in our consolidated financial statements.

Smelting & Refining

We wholly own and operate a smelter in Arizona (Miami 
smelter), a refinery in Texas (El Paso refinery) and a smelter 
and refinery in Spain (Atlantic Copper). Additionally, PT-FI 
owns 25 percent of a smelter and refinery in Gresik, Indonesia 
(PT Smelting). Treatment charges for smelting and refining 
copper concentrate consist of a base rate per pound of copper 
and per ounce of gold and are generally fixed. Treatment 
charges represent a cost to our mining operations and income 

2017 Annual Report

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS

to Atlantic Copper and PT Smelting. Thus, higher treatment 
charges benefit our smelter operations and adversely affect 
our mining operations. Our North America copper mines are 
less significantly affected by changes in treatment charges 
because these operations are largely integrated with our Miami 
smelter and El Paso refinery. Through this form of downstream 
integration, we are assured placement of a significant portion 
of our concentrate production.

Atlantic Copper smelts and refines copper concentrate  

and markets refined copper and precious metals in slimes.

purchases from our copper mining operations and third parties

PT-FI’s contract with PT Smelting provides for PT-FI to  
supply 100 percent of the copper concentrate requirements 
(subject to a minimum or maximum treatment charge rate) 
necessary for PT Smelting to produce 205,000 metric tons of 
copper annually on a priority basis. PT-FI may also sell copper 
concentrate to PT Smelting at market rates for quantities  
in excess of 205,000 metric tons of copper annually. PT-FI 
supplied 93 percent of PT Smelting’s concentrate requirements 
in 2017, 88 percent in 2016 and 80 percent in 2015. PT Smelting 
processed 46 percent in 2017, 42 percent in 2016 and  
37 percent in 2015 of PT-FI’s concentrate production. On 
February 15, 2018, PT Smelting submitted an application  
to renew its export license, which expires March 1, 2018. 
We defer recognizing profits on sales from our mining 

operations to Atlantic Copper and on 25 percent of PT-FI’s 
sales to PT Smelting until final sales to third parties occur. 
Changes in these deferrals attributable to variability in 
intercompany volumes resulted in net (reductions) additions to 
net income attributable to common stock of $(21) million 
($(0.01) per share) in 2017, $(8) million ($(0.01) per share) in 
2016 and $42 million ($0.04 per share) in 2015. Our net 
deferred profits on our inventories at Atlantic Copper and  
PT Smelting to be recognized in future periods’ net income 
attributable to common stock totaled $96 million at 
December 31, 2017. Quarterly variations in ore grades, the 
timing of intercompany shipments and changes in product 
prices will result in variability in our net deferred profits and 
quarterly earnings.

Oil and Gas Operations

During 2016 and 2017, we completed the sales of our Deepwater 
GOM, onshore California and Haynesville oil and gas properties,  
and property interests in the GOM Shelf and in the Madden 
area of central Wyoming. As a result, our portfolio of oil and 
gas assets includes oil and natural gas production onshore in 
South Louisiana and on the GOM Shelf and oil production 
offshore California. At December 31, 2017, we had $8 million 
remaining in our consolidated balance sheet for proved oil  
and gas properties, and no amounts recorded for unproved oil 
and gas properties.

of $45.13 per barrel) and $45.58 per barrel in 2015 (85 percent 
of the average Brent crude oil price of $53.64 per barrel).

The average realized price for natural gas was $3.18 per 

MMBtu in 2017, $2.38 per MMBtu in 2016 and $2.59 per MMBtu 
in 2015, compared to the NYMEX natural gas price average  
of $3.10 per MMBtu in 2017, $2.46 per MMBtu in 2016 and 
$2.66 per MMBtu in 2015. 

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY

Our consolidated operating cash flows vary with prices 
realized from copper, gold and molybdenum; our sales volumes; 
production costs; income taxes; other working capital 
changes; and other factors. We have taken actions to restore 
our balance sheet strength through a combination of asset 
sale and capital market transactions. These actions, combined 
with cash flow from operations, resulted in significant debt 
reductions during 2017 and 2016. We believe that we have a 
high-quality portfolio of long-lived copper assets positioned to 
generate long-term value. We have commenced a project to 

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION

develop the Lone Star oxide ores near the Safford operation  
in eastern Arizona. We are also pursuing other opportunities 
to enhance net present values, and we continue to advance 
studies for future development of our copper resources, the 
timing of which will be dependent on market conditions.

Cash held at our international operations is generally used to 
support our foreign operations’ capital expenditures, 
operating expenses, debt repayments, working capital and 
other tax payments or other cash needs. Management believes 
that sufficient liquidity is available in the U.S. from cash 
balances and availability from our revolving credit facility.  
We have not elected to permanently reinvest earnings from 
our foreign subsidiaries, and we have recorded deferred  
tax liabilities for foreign earnings that are available to be 
repatriated to the U.S. Refer to Note 11 for discussion of  
U.S. tax reform. From time to time, our foreign subsidiaries 
distribute earnings to the U.S. through dividends that are 
subject to applicable withholding taxes and noncontrolling 
interests’ share.

Operating Activities

We generated consolidated operating cash flows totaling  
$4.7 billion in 2017 (including $0.6 billion in working capital 
sources and timing of other tax payments), $3.7 billion in 2016 
(including $87 million in working capital sources and timing of 
other tax payments) and $3.2 billion in 2015 (net of $0.4 billion 
in working capital sources and timing of other tax payments).

Higher operating cash flows for 2017, compared with 2016, 
primarily reflected the impact of higher copper prices and an 
increase in working capital sources from income tax refunds 
and other tax receivable collections, partly offset by increases 
in inventories.

Higher operating cash flows for 2016, compared with 2015, 

primarily reflected the impact of cost reduction efforts, partly 
offset by a decrease in working capital sources mostly 
resulting from higher trade receivables, partly offset by lower 
tax payments by our international mining operations.

Subject to future commodity prices for copper, gold and 
molybdenum, we expect estimated consolidated operating 
cash flows in 2018, plus available cash and availability under 
our credit facility to be sufficient to fund our budgeted capital 
expenditures, scheduled debt maturities, noncontrolling 
interest distributions and other cash requirements for the year. 
Refer to “Outlook” for further discussion of projected 
operating cash flows in 2018, and to “Operations—Indonesia 
Mining” and “Risk Factors” contained in Part I, Item 1A. of our 
annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 
2017, for discussion of regulatory matters in Indonesia, which 
may have a significant impact on future results.

Investing Activities

Capital Expenditures. Capital expenditures, including capitalized 
interest, totaled $1.4 billion in 2017, including $0.9 billion  
for major mining projects; $2.8 billion in 2016, consisting of 
$1.6 billion for mining operations (including $1.2 billion for 
major projects) and $1.2 billion for oil and gas operations; and 
$6.4 billion in 2015, consisting of $3.3 billion for mining 
operations (including $2.4 billion for major projects) and 
$3.0 billion for oil and gas operations.

Lower capital expenditures in 2017, compared with 2016, 

primarily reflected a decrease in oil and gas exploration and 
development activities as a result of the sale of substantially  
all of our oil and gas properties in late 2016.

Lower capital expenditures in 2016, compared with 2015, 

At December 31, 2017, we had no borrowings, $13 million in 
letters of credit issued and availability of $3.5 billion under our 
revolving credit facility.

reinstated a cash dividend on our common stock. The Board 
intends to declare a quarterly dividend of $0.05 per share, with 
the initial dividend expected to be paid May 1, 2018. The 
declaration of dividends is at the discretion of the Board and 
will depend upon our financial results, cash requirements, future 
prospects and other factors deemed relevant.

We paid dividends on our common stock totaling $2 million 
in 2017, $6 million in 2016, and $605 million in 2015 (including 
$115 million for a special dividend paid in accordance with  
the settlement terms of the shareholder derivative litigation). 
Dividends paid in 2017 and 2016 all relate to accumulated 
dividends paid for vested stock-based compensation.

Net repayments of debt in 2016 totaled $3.9 billion, 

Cash dividends and other distributions paid to noncontrolling 

primarily for the repayment of an unsecured bank term loan 
and payments on the Cerro Verde credit facility.

Net proceeds from debt in 2015 totaled $1.6 billion, primarily 
reflecting borrowings of $1.4 billion under Cerro Verde’s credit 
facility to fund its expansion project.

interests totaled $174 million in 2017, $693 million in 2016 
(including $582 million for the redemption of a redeemable 
noncontrolling interest) and $120 million in 2015. These 
payments will vary based on the operating results and cash 
requirements of our consolidated subsidiaries.

Refer to Note 8 for further discussion of debt transactions. 
Equity Transactions. Net proceeds from the sale of common 

stock of $1.5 billion in 2016 and $1.9 billion in 2015 reflected

b.  Scheduled interest payment obligations were calculated using stated coupon rates for fixed-rate debt and interest rates applicable at December 31, 2017, for variable-rate debt.
c.  Represents estimated cash payments, on an undiscounted and unescalated basis, associated with ARO and environmental activities (including $659 million for our oil and gas operations). The timing and the 

amount of these payments could change as a result of changes in regulatory requirements, changes in scope and timing of ARO activities, the settlement of environmental matters and as actual spending occurs. 
Refer to Note 12 for additional discussion of environmental and ARO matters.

d.  Represents contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services agreements enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, and primarily include the procurement of copper concentrate 

($2.4 billion), electricity ($0.4 billion) and transportation services ($0.3 billion). Some of our take-or-pay contracts are settled based on the prevailing market rate for the service or commodity purchased, and in  
some cases, the amount of the actual obligation may change over time because of market conditions. Obligations for copper concentrate provide for deliveries of specified volumes to Atlantic Copper at market-based 
prices. Electricity obligations are primarily for long-term power purchase agreements in North America and contractual minimum demand at the South America mines. Transportation obligations are primarily for 
South America contracted ocean freight. Amounts exclude approximately $0.8 billion in total contractual obligations related to assets held for sale, which is primarily for the procurement of cobalt. Obligations for 
cobalt provide for deliveries of specified volumes to Freeport Cobalt (an asset held for sale) at market-based prices.

e.  This table excludes certain other obligations in our consolidated balance sheets, such as estimated funding for pension, postretirement and other employee benefit obligations as the funding may vary from year to 

year based on changes in the fair value of plan assets and actuarial assumptions, commitments and contingencies totaling $98 million and unrecognized tax benefits totaling $291 million where the timing of 
settlement is not determinable, and other less significant amounts. This table also excludes purchase orders for inventory and other goods and services, as purchase orders typically represent authorizations to 
purchase rather than binding agreements.

In addition to our debt maturities and other contractual 
obligations discussed above, we have other commitments, 
which we expect to fund with available cash, projected 
operating cash flows, available credit facilities or future 

financing transactions, if necessary. These include (i) PT-FI’s 
commitment to provide one percent of its annual revenue for 
the development of the local people in its area of operations 
through the Freeport Partnership Fund for Community

Development, (ii) Cerro Verde’s scheduled installment 
payments for disputed mining royalty assessments and  
(iii) other commercial commitments, including standby letters

and 13 for further discussion.

$30 million in 2017, $133 million in 2016 and $92 million in 2015 
for our oil and gas operations). For 2018, we expect to incur 
approximately $0.3 billion in aggregate ARO payments 
(including $157 million for our oil and gas operations). Refer to 
Note 12 for further discussion.

CONTINGENCIES
Environmental

The cost of complying with environmental laws is a fundamental 
and substantial cost of our business. At December 31, 2017,  
we had $1.4 billion recorded in our consolidated balance sheet 
for environmental obligations attributed to CERCLA or 
analogous state programs and for estimated future costs 
associated with environmental obligations that are considered 
probable based on specific facts and circumstances.

We incurred environmental capital expenditures and other 

environmental costs (including our joint venture partners’ 
shares) to comply with applicable environmental laws and 
regulations that affect our operations totaling $0.5 billion  
in 2017 and $0.4 billion in each of 2016 and 2015. For 2018, 
we expect to incur approximately $0.5 billion of aggregate 
environmental capital expenditures and other environmental 
costs. The timing and amount of estimated payments could 
change as a result of changes in regulatory requirements, 
changes in scope and timing of reclamation and plug and 
abandonment activities, the settlement of environmental 
matters and the rate at which actual spending occurs on 
continuing matters.

Refer to Note 12 and “Risk Factors” contained in Part I,  

Item 1A. of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended 
December 31, 2017, for further information about environmental 
regulation, including significant environmental matters.

Asset Retirement Obligations

We recognize AROs as liabilities when incurred, with the initial 
measurement at fair value. These obligations, which are 
initially estimated based on discounted cash flow estimates, 
are accreted to full value over time through charges to cost of 
sales. Mine reclamation costs for disturbances are recorded  
as an ARO and as a related asset retirement cost (ARC) 
(included in property, plant, equipment and mine development 
costs) in the period of disturbance. Oil and gas plugging and 
abandonment costs are recognized as an ARO and as a related 
ARC (included in oil and gas properties) in the period in 
which the well is drilled or acquired. Our cost estimates are 
reflected on a third-party cost basis and comply with our legal 
obligation to retire tangible, long-lived assets. At December 31, 
2017, we had $2.6 billion recorded in our consolidated balance 
sheet for AROs, including $0.6 billion related to our oil and  
gas properties. Spending on AROs totaled $71 million in 2017, 
$188 million in 2016 and $132 million in 2015 (including  

Litigation and Other Contingencies

Refer to Notes 2 and 12 and “Legal Proceedings” contained in 
Part I, Item 3. of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year 
ended December 31, 2017, for further discussion of contingencies 
associated with legal proceedings and other matters.

DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS
Commodity Price Risk

Our consolidated revenues from our mining operations include 
the sale of copper concentrate, copper cathode, copper rod, 
gold, molybdenum and other metals by our North America and 
South America mines, the sale of copper concentrate (which 
also contains significant quantities of gold and silver) by our 
Indonesia mining operations, the sale of molybdenum in 
various forms by our molybdenum operations, and the sale of 
copper cathode, copper anode and gold in anode and slimes by 
Atlantic Copper. Our financial results will vary with fluctuations 
in the market prices of the commodities we produce, primarily 
copper and gold, and to a lesser extent molybdenum and 
silver. For projected sensitivities of our operating cash flow to 
changes in commodity prices, refer to “Outlook.” World 
market prices for these commodities have fluctuated historically 
and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control. 
Refer to “Risk Factors” contained in Part I, Item 1A. of our annual 
report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, for 
further discussion of financial risks associated with fluctuations 
in the market prices of the commodities we sell.

During 2017, our mined copper was sold 59 percent in 

concentrate, 19 percent as cathode and 22 percent as rod from 
North America operations. Substantially all of our copper 
concentrate and cathode sales contracts provide final copper 
pricing in a specified future month (generally one to four 
months from the shipment date) based primarily on quoted 
LME monthly average spot copper prices. We receive market 
prices based on prices in the specified future period, which 
results in price fluctuations recorded through revenues until 
the date of settlement. We record revenues and invoice 
customers at the time of shipment based on then-current LME 
prices, which results in an embedded derivative on our 
provisionally priced concentrate and cathode sales that is 
adjusted to fair value through earnings each period, using the 
period-end forward prices, until final pricing on the date of 
settlement. To the extent final prices are higher or lower than 
what was recorded on a provisional basis, an increase or 

2017 Annual Report

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS

decrease to revenues is recorded each reporting period until 
the date of final pricing. Accordingly, in times of rising copper 
prices, our revenues benefit from adjustments to the final 
pricing of provisionally priced sales pursuant to contracts 
entered into in prior periods; in times of falling copper prices, 
the opposite occurs.

Following are the favorable (unfavorable) impacts of net 

adjustments to the prior years’ provisionally priced copper 
sales for the years ended December 31 (in millions, except per 
share amounts):

At December 31, 2017, we had provisionally priced copper 
sales at our copper mining operations totaling 438 million 
pounds of copper (net of intercompany sales and noncontrolling 
interests) recorded at an average price of $3.28 per pound, 
subject to final pricing over the next several months. We 
estimate that each $0.05 change in the price realized from the 
December 31, 2017, provisional price recorded would have an 

approximate $13 million effect on 2018 net income attributable 
to common stock. The LME spot copper price closed at $3.22 
per pound on January 31, 2018.

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk

The functional currency for most of our operations is the U.S. 
dollar. Substantially all of our revenues and a significant 
portion of our costs are denominated in U.S. dollars; however, 
some costs and certain asset and liability accounts are 
denominated in local currencies, including the Indonesian 
rupiah, Australian dollar, Peruvian sol, Chilean peso and euro. 
We recognized foreign currency translation (losses) gains  
on balances denominated in foreign currencies totaling  
$(5) million in 2017, $32 million in 2016 and $(90) million in 
2015, primarily at our Indonesia and South America mines. 
Generally, our operating results are positively affected when 
the U.S. dollar strengthens in relation to those foreign 
currencies and are adversely affected when the U.S. dollar 
weakens in relation to those foreign currencies.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS

We show revenue adjustments for prior period open sales 

as separate line items. Because these adjustments do not 
result from current period sales, these amounts have been 
reflected separately from revenues on current period sales. 
Noncash and other costs, which are removed from site 
production and delivery costs in the calculation of unit net 
cash costs, consist of items such as stock-based compensation 
costs, start-up costs, inventory adjustments, long-lived asset 
impairments, restructuring and/or unusual charges. As 
discussed above, gold, molybdenum and other metal revenues 
at copper mines are reflected as credits against site 
production and delivery costs in the by-product method.  
The following schedules are presentations under both the 
by-product and co-product methods together with 
reconciliations to amounts reported in our consolidated 
financial statements.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

Refer to Note 1 for discussion of recently issued accounting 
standards and their projected impact on our future financial 
statements and disclosures.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

Refer to Note 13 for discussion of off-balance sheet arrangements.

PRODUCT REVENUES AND PRODUCTION COSTS
Mining Product Revenues and Unit Net Cash Costs

Unit net cash costs per pound of copper and molybdenum are 
measures intended to provide investors with information  
about the cash-generating capacity of our mining operations 
expressed on a basis relating to the primary metal product  
for the respective operations. We use this measure for the 
same purpose and for monitoring operating performance by 
our mining operations. This information differs from measures 
of performance determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP  
and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for 
measures of performance determined in accordance with U.S. 
GAAP. These measures are presented by other metals mining 
companies, although our measures may not be comparable  
to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

We present gross profit per pound of copper in the 

following tables using both a “by-product” method and a 
“co-product” method. We use the by-product method in  
our presentation of gross profit per pound of copper because 
(i) the majority of our revenues are copper revenues, (ii) we 
mine ore, which contains copper, gold, molybdenum and other 
metals, (iii) it is not possible to specifically assign all of our 
costs to revenues from the copper, gold, molybdenum and 
other metals we produce, (iv) it is the method used to 
compare mining operations in certain industry publications 
and (v) it is the method used by our management and the 
Board to monitor operations and to compare mining 
operations in certain industry publications. In the co-product 
method presentations, shared costs are allocated to the 
different products based on their relative revenue values, 
which will vary to the extent our metals sales volumes and 
realized prices change.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT

Our discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements 
in which we discuss our potential future performance. Forward- 
looking statements are all statements other than statements of 
historical facts, such as projections or expectations relating  
to ore grades and milling rates, production and sales volumes, 
unit net cash costs, operating cash flows, anticipated tax 
refunds resulting from U.S. tax reform, capital expenditures, 
exploration efforts and results, development and production 
activities and costs, liquidity, tax rates, the impact of copper, 
gold and molybdenum price changes, the impact of deferred 
intercompany profits on earnings, reserve estimates, future 
dividend payments, and share purchases and sales. The words 
“anticipates,” “may,” “can,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates,” 
“expects,” “projects,” “targets,” “intends,” “likely,” “will,” “should,” 
“to be,” “potential” and any similar expressions are intended 
to identify those assertions as forward-looking statements. 
Our discussion also contains forward-looking statements  
and estimates regarding the anticipated effects of the Tax Cuts 
and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017. These statements 
and estimates are based on our current interpretation of  
this legislation, which may change as a result of additional 
implementation guidance, changes in assumptions, and 
potential future refinements of or revisions to calculations.

We caution readers that forward-looking statements are not 

guarantees of future performance and actual results may  
differ materially from those anticipated, projected or assumed 
in the forward-looking statements. Important factors that  
can cause our actual results to differ materially from those 
anticipated in the forward-looking statements include supply  

of and demand for, and prices of copper, gold and molybdenum; 
mine sequencing; production rates; potential inventory 
adjustments; potential impairment of long-lived mining assets, 
the outcome of negotiations with the Indonesian government 
regarding PT-FI’s long-term mining rights; the potential effects 
of violence in Indonesia generally and in the province of 
Papua; industry risks; regulatory changes; political risks; labor 
relations; weather- and climate-related risks; environmental 
risks; litigation results (including the final disposition of 
Indonesian tax disputes and the outcome of Cerro Verde’s 
royalty dispute with the Peruvian national tax authority); and 
other factors described in more detail in Part I, Item 1A.  
“Risk Factors” of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year 
ended December 31, 2017. With respect to our operations  
in Indonesia, such factors include whether PT-FI will be able to 
resolve complex regulatory matters in Indonesia and continue 
to operate after June 30, 2018.

Investors are cautioned that many of the assumptions  

upon which our forward-looking statements are based are 
likely to change after the forward-looking statements are 
made, including for example commodity prices, which we 
cannot control, and production volumes and costs, some 
aspects of which we may not be able to control. Further, we 
may make changes to our business plans that could affect  
our results. We caution investors that we do not intend to 
update forward-looking statements more frequently than 
quarterly notwithstanding any changes in our assumptions, 
changes in business plans, actual experience or other 
changes, and we undertake no obligation to update any 
forward-looking statements.

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL 
OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 

Freeport-McMoRan Inc.’s (the Company’s) management is 
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal 
control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial 
reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or 
under the supervision of, the Company’s principal executive 
and principal financial officers and effected by the Company’s 
Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to 
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of 
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements 
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles and includes those policies and 
procedures that:
•  Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable 

detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and 
dispositions of the Company’s assets;

•  Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are 

recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial 
statements in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures  
of the Company are being made only in accordance with 
authorizations of management and directors of the 
Company; and

•  Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or 

timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or 
disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a 
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over 

financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. 
Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods 
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate 
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of 
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Our management, including our principal executive officer 

and principal financial officer, assessed the effectiveness  
of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of 
the fiscal year covered by this annual report on Form 10-K.  
In making this assessment, our management used the criteria 
set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by 
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway 
Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). Based on 
its assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 
2017, our Company’s internal control over financial reporting  
is effective based on the COSO criteria.

Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public 

accounting firm, who audited the Company’s consolidated 
financial statements included in this Form 10-K, has issued  
an attestation report on the Company’s internal control over 
financial reporting, which is included herein.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED 
PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND 
STOCKHOLDERS OF FREEPORT-MCMORAN INC.

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited Freeport-McMoRan Inc.’s internal control 
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on 
criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework 
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the 
Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). 
In our opinion, Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (the Company) 
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control 
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on  
the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards  

of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board 
(United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets  
of Freeport-McMoRan Inc. as of December 31, 2017 and  
2016, and the related consolidated statements of operations, 
comprehensive income (loss), equity and cash flows for  
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, 
and the related notes of the Company and our report dated 
February 20, 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining 
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its 
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over 
financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s 
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our 
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal 
control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are  
a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are 
required to be independent with respect to the Company  
in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the 
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange 
Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards 

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal 

control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a 
material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design 
and operating effectiveness of internal control based on  
the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as 
we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe  
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control  
Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a 
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding 
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of 
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s 
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies 
and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records 
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the 
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are 
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial 
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company 
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of 
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide 
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely 
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of 
the company’s assets that could have a material effect on  
the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over 

financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. 
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future 
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become 
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree 
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and 
perform  the  audit  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about 
whether effective internal control over financial reporting  
was maintained in all material respects.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED 
PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND 
STOCKHOLDERS OF FREEPORT-MCMORAN INC.

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance 
sheets of Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (the Company) as of 
December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the related consolidated 
statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), 
equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period 
ended December 31, 2017, and the related notes (collectively 
referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion,  
the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, 
the consolidated financial position of the Company at 
December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the consolidated results of 
its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years  
in the period ended December 31, 2017, in conformity with U.S. 
generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of  

the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) 
(PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial 
reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established 
in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the 
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway 
Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated  
February 20, 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the 
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an 
opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on  
our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the 
PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to 
the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities 
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities 
and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards 

of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and 
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
the financial statements are free of material misstatement, 
whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing 
procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of  
the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and 
performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such 
procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence 
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting 
principles used and significant estimates made by management, 
as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial 
statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable 
basis for our opinion.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT  
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation. The consolidated financial statements 
of Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (FCX) include the accounts  
of those subsidiaries where it directly or indirectly has  
more than 50 percent of the voting rights and has the right 
to control significant management decisions. As of 
December 31, 2017, the most significant entities that FCX 
consolidates include its 90.64 percent-owned subsidiary  
PT Freeport Indonesia (PT-FI), and the following wholly owned 
subsidiaries: Freeport Minerals Corporation (FMC) and 
Atlantic Copper, S.L.U. (Atlantic Copper).

FCX acquired mining assets in North America, South America 

and Africa when it acquired Phelps Dodge Corporation (now 
known as FMC) in 2007. FCX acquired oil and gas operations 
when it acquired Plains Exploration & Production Company 
(PXP) and McMoRan Exploration Co. (MMR), collectively 
known as FCX Oil & Gas LLC (FM O&G, formerly FCX Oil & Gas 
Inc.), in 2013. Subsequent to the acquisitions, FCX completed 
sales of its Africa mining operations and substantially all of its 
oil and gas operations. Refer to Note 2 for further discussion.

FCX’s unincorporated joint ventures with Rio Tinto plc  

(Rio Tinto), Sumitomo Metal Mining Arizona, Inc. (Sumitomo) 
and SMM Morenci, Inc. (an affiliate of Sumitomo Metal Mining 
Co., Ltd.) are reflected using the proportionate consolidation 
method (refer to Note 3 for further discussion). Investments  
in unconsolidated companies owned 20 percent or more  
are recorded using the equity method. Investments in 
companies owned less than 20 percent, and for which FCX 
does not exercise significant influence, are carried at cost.  
All significant intercompany transactions have been 
eliminated. Dollar amounts in tables are stated in millions, 
except per share amounts.

Business Segments. FCX has organized its mining operations 

into four primary divisions—North America copper mines, 
South America mining, Indonesia mining and Molybdenum 
mines, and operating segments that meet certain thresholds 
are reportable segments. FCX’s reportable segments 
include the Morenci, Cerro Verde and Grasberg (Indonesia 
mining) copper mines, the Rod & Refining operations  
and Atlantic Copper Smelting & Refining. Refer to Note 16  
for further discussion.

Use of Estimates. The preparation of FCX’s financial 

statements in conformity with accounting principles generally 
accepted in the United States (U.S.) requires management  
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts 
reported in these financial statements and accompanying 

notes. The more significant areas requiring the use of 
management estimates include minerals reserve estimation; 
asset lives for depreciation, depletion and amortization; 
environmental obligations; asset retirement obligations; 
estimates of recoverable copper in mill and leach stockpiles; 
deferred taxes and valuation allowances; reserves for 
contingencies and litigation; asset impairment, including 
estimates used to derive future cash flows associated with 
those assets; pension benefits; and valuation of derivative 
instruments. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Functional Currency. The functional currency for the 

majority of FCX’s foreign operations is the U.S. dollar. For 
foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.S. 
dollar, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in the local 
currency are translated at current exchange rates, and 
non-monetary assets and liabilities, such as inventories, 
property, plant, equipment and mine development costs, are 
translated at historical rates. Gains and losses resulting  
from translation of such account balances are included in 
other income, net, as are gains and losses from foreign 
currency transactions. Foreign currency (losses) gains totaled 
$(5) million in 2017, $32 million in 2016 and $(90) million  
in 2015.

Cash Equivalents. Highly liquid investments purchased 

with maturities of three months or less are considered cash 
equivalents.

Inventories. Inventories include materials and supplies, mill 

and leach stockpiles, and product inventories. Inventories are 
stated at the lower of weighted-average cost or net realizable 
value (NRV).

Mill and Leach Stockpiles. Mill and leach stockpiles are 

work-in-process inventories for FCX’s mining operations.  
Mill and leach stockpiles contain ore that has been extracted 
from an ore body and is available for copper recovery.  
Mill stockpiles contain sulfide ores, and recovery of metal  
is through milling, concentrating and smelting and refining 
or, alternatively, by concentrate leaching. Leach stockpiles 
contain oxide ores and certain secondary sulfide ores, and 
recovery of metal is through exposure to acidic solutions 
that dissolve contained copper and deliver it in solution to 
extraction processing facilities (i.e., solution extraction  
and electrowinning (SX/EW)). The recorded cost of mill  
and leach stockpiles includes mining and haulage costs 
incurred to deliver ore to stockpiles, depreciation, depletion, 
amortization and site overhead costs. Material is removed 
from the stockpiles at a weighted-average cost per pound.

2017 Annual Report

71

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Because it is impracticable to determine copper contained 

in mill and leach stockpiles by physical count, reasonable 
estimation methods are employed. The quantity of material 
delivered to mill and leach stockpiles is based on surveyed 
volumes of mined material and daily production records. 
Sampling and assaying of blasthole cuttings determine the 
estimated copper grade of the material delivered to mill  
and leach stockpiles.

Expected copper recovery rates for mill stockpiles are 

determined by metallurgical testing. The recoverable copper 
in mill stockpiles, once entered into the production process, 
can be produced into copper concentrate almost immediately.

Expected copper recovery rates for leach stockpiles are 

determined using small-scale laboratory tests, small- to 
large-scale column testing (which simulates the production 
process), historical trends and other factors, including 
mineralogy of the ore and rock type. Total copper recovery in 
leach stockpiles can vary significantly from a low percentage 
to more than 90 percent depending on several variables, 
including processing methodology, processing variables, 
mineralogy and particle size of the rock. For newly placed 
material on active stockpiles, as much as 80 percent of the 
total copper recovery may occur during the first year, and 
the remaining copper may be recovered over many years.

Processes and recovery rates for mill and leach stockpiles 

are monitored regularly, and recovery rate estimates are 
adjusted periodically as additional information becomes 
available and as related technology changes. Adjustments to 
recovery rates will typically result in a future impact to the 
value of the material removed from the stockpiles at a revised 
weighted-average cost per pound of recoverable copper.

Product Inventories. Product inventories include raw 

materials, work-in-process and finished goods. Raw materials 
are primarily unprocessed concentrate at Atlantic Copper’s 
smelting and refining operations. Work-in-process inventories 
are primarily copper concentrate at various stages of 
conversion into anode and cathode at Atlantic Copper’s 
operations. Atlantic Copper’s in-process inventories are 
valued at the weighted-average cost of the material fed to 
the smelting and refining process plus in-process conversion 
costs. Finished goods for mining operations represent 
salable products (e.g., copper and molybdenum concentrate, 
copper anode, copper cathode, copper rod, copper wire, 
molybdenum oxide, and high-purity molybdenum chemicals 
and other metallurgical products). Finished goods are 
valued based on the weighted-average cost of source material 
plus applicable conversion costs relating to associated 
process facilities. Costs of finished goods and work-in-process 

(i.e., not raw materials) inventories include labor and benefits, 
supplies, energy, depreciation, depletion, amortization, site 
overhead costs and other necessary costs associated with the 
extraction and processing of ore, including, depending on  
the process, mining, haulage, milling, concentrating, smelting, 
leaching, solution extraction, refining, roasting and chemical 
processing. Corporate general and administrative costs are not 
included in inventory costs.

Property, Plant, Equipment and Mine Development Costs. 
Property, plant, equipment and mine development costs  
are carried at cost. Mineral exploration costs, as well as 
drilling and other costs incurred for the purpose of 
converting mineral resources to proven and probable 
reserves or identifying new mineral resources at development  
or production stage properties, are charged to expense as 
incurred. Development costs are capitalized beginning after 
proven and probable mineral reserves have been established. 
Development costs include costs incurred resulting from 
mine pre-production activities undertaken to gain access to 
proven and probable reserves, including shafts, adits, drifts, 
ramps, permanent excavations, infrastructure and removal 
of overburden. Additionally, interest expense allocable to  
the cost of developing mining properties and to constructing 
new facilities is capitalized until assets are ready for their 
intended use.

Expenditures for replacements and improvements are 

capitalized. Costs related to periodic scheduled maintenance 
(i.e., turnarounds) are charged to expense as incurred. 
Depreciation for mining and milling life-of-mine assets, 
infrastructure and other common costs is determined using 
the unit-of-production (UOP) method based on total 
estimated recoverable proven and probable copper reserves 
(for primary copper mines) and proven and probable 
molybdenum reserves (for primary molybdenum mines). 
Development costs and acquisition costs for proven and 
probable mineral reserves that relate to a specific ore body 
are depreciated using the UOP method based on estimated 
recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves for the  
ore body benefited. Depreciation, depletion and amortization 
using the UOP method is recorded upon extraction of the 
recoverable copper or molybdenum from the ore body, at 
which time it is allocated to inventory cost and then included 
as a component of cost of goods sold. Other assets are 
depreciated on a straight-line basis over estimated useful 
lives of up to 39 years for buildings and three to 30 years for 
machinery and equipment, and mobile equipment.

Oil and Gas Properties. FCX follows the full cost method of 

development costs is value beyond proven and probable 
mineral reserves (VBPP), primarily resulting from FCX’s 
acquisition of FMC in 2007. The concept of VBPP may be 
interpreted differently by different mining companies.  
FCX’s VBPP is attributable to (i) mineralized material, which 
includes measured and indicated amounts, that FCX believes 
could be brought into production with the establishment or 
modification of required permits and should market 
conditions and technical assessments warrant, (ii) inferred 
mineral resources and (iii) exploration potential.

Carrying amounts assigned to VBPP are not charged to 

expense until the VBPP becomes associated with additional 
proven and probable mineral reserves and the reserves are 
produced or the VBPP is determined to be impaired. Additions 
to proven and probable mineral reserves for properties with 
VBPP will carry with them the value assigned to VBPP at the 
date acquired, less any impairment amounts. Refer to Note 5 
for further discussion.

Impairment of Long-Lived Mining Assets. FCX assesses the 

carrying values of its long-lived mining assets for impairment 
when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
related carrying amounts of such assets may not be 
recoverable. In evaluating long-lived mining assets for 
recoverability, estimates of pre-tax undiscounted future cash 
flows of FCX’s individual mines are used. An impairment is 
considered to exist if total estimated undiscounted future 
cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset. 
Once it is determined that an impairment exists, an 
impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the 
asset carrying value exceeds its fair value. The estimated 
undiscounted cash flows used to assess recoverability of 
long-lived assets and to measure the fair value of FCX’s 
mining operations are derived from current business plans, 
which are developed using near-term price forecasts 
reflective of the current price environment and 
management’s projections for long-term average metal 
prices. In addition to near- and long-term metal price 
assumptions, other key assumptions include estimates of 
commodity-based and other input costs; proven and 
probable mineral reserves estimates, including the timing and 
cost to develop and produce the reserves; VBPP estimates; 
and the use of appropriate discount rates in the measurement 
of fair value. FCX believes its estimates and models used to 
determine fair value are similar to what a market participant 
would use. As quoted market prices are unavailable for FCX’s 
individual mining operations, fair value is determined through 
the use of after-tax discounted estimated future cash flows 
(i.e., Level 3 measurement).

accounting specified by the U.S. Securities and Exchange 
Commission’s (SEC) rules whereby all costs associated with 
oil and gas property acquisition, exploration and 
development activities are capitalized into a cost center on  
a country-by-country basis. Such costs include internal 
general and administrative costs, such as payroll and related 
benefits and costs directly attributable to employees 
engaged in acquisition, exploration and development activities. 
General and administrative costs associated with production, 
operations, marketing and general corporate activities are 
charged to expense as incurred. Capitalized costs, along with 
estimated future costs to develop proved reserves and asset 
retirement costs that are not already included in oil and gas 
properties, net of related salvage value, are amortized to 
expense under the UOP method using engineers’ estimates 
of the related, by-country proved oil and natural gas reserves.

The costs of unproved oil and gas properties were excluded 

from amortization until the properties were evaluated. Costs 
were transferred into the amortization base on an ongoing 
basis as the properties were evaluated and proved oil and 
natural gas reserves were established or if impairment was 
determined. Unproved oil and gas properties were assessed 
periodically, at least annually, to determine whether 
impairment had occurred. FCX assessed unproved oil and 
gas properties for impairment on an individual basis or as a 
group if properties were individually insignificant. The 
assessment considered the following factors, among others: 
intent to drill, remaining lease term, geological and geophysical 
evaluations, drilling results and activity, the assignment  
of proved reserves, the economic viability of development if 
proved reserves were assigned and other current market 
conditions. During any period in which these factors 
indicated an impairment, the cumulative drilling costs 
incurred to date for such property and all or a portion of the 
associated leasehold costs were transferred to the full  
cost pool and were then subject to amortization. Including 
amounts determined to be impaired, FCX transferred  
$4.9 billion of costs associated with unevaluated properties 
to the full cost pool in 2016 and $6.4 billion in 2015. The 
transfer of costs into the amortization base involved a 
significant amount of judgment. Costs not subject to 
amortization consisted primarily of capitalized costs incurred 
for undeveloped acreage and wells in progress pending 
determination, together with capitalized interest for these 
projects. Following the completion of the sales of oil and  
gas properties discussed in Note 2, FCX had no unproved oil 
and gas properties in the consolidated balance sheets at

December 31, 2017 or 2016. Interest costs totaling $7 million 
in 2016 and $58 million in 2015 were capitalized on oil and 
gas properties not subject to amortization and in the process 
of development.

reserve revisions. The twelve-month average WTI reference 
oil price was $51.34 per barrel at December 31, 2017, 
compared with $42.75 per barrel at December 31, 2016, and 
$50.28 per barrel at December 31, 2015.

Proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties are 

Deferred Mining Costs. Stripping costs (i.e., the costs of 

accounted for as reductions to capitalized costs unless the 
reduction causes a significant change in proved reserves, 
which, absent other factors, is generally described as a  
25 percent or greater change, and significantly alters the 
relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves 
attributable to a cost center, in which case a gain or loss  
is recognized.

Impairment of Oil and Gas Properties. Under the SEC full 

cost accounting rules, FCX reviews the carrying value of its 
oil and gas properties in the full cost pool for impairment 
each quarter on a country-by-country basis. Under these 
rules, capitalized costs of oil and gas properties (net  
of accumulated depreciation, depletion, amortization and 
impairment, and related deferred income taxes) for each  
cost center may not exceed a “ceiling” equal to:
•  the present value, discounted at 10 percent, of estimated 

future net cash flows from the related proved oil and natural 
gas reserves, net of estimated future income taxes; plus

•  the cost of the related unproved properties not being 

amortized; plus

•  the lower of cost or estimated fair value of the related 

unproved properties included in the costs being amortized 
(net of related tax effects).
These rules require that FCX price its future oil and gas 

production at the twelve-month average of the first-day-of-
the-month historical reference prices as adjusted for location 
and quality differentials. FCX’s reference prices are West 
Texas Intermediate (WTI) for oil and the Henry Hub price for 
natural gas. Such prices are utilized except where different 
prices are fixed and determinable from applicable contracts 
for the remaining term of those contracts. The reserve 
estimates exclude the effect of any crude oil and natural gas 
derivatives FCX has in place. The estimated future net cash 
flows also exclude future cash outflows associated with 
settling asset retirement obligations included in the net book 
value of the oil and gas properties. The rules require an 
impairment if the capitalized costs exceed this “ceiling.”
In 2016 and 2015, net capitalized costs with respect to 
FCX’s proved oil and gas properties exceeded the related 
ceiling test limitation; therefore, impairment charges of  
$4.3 billion were recorded in 2016 and $13.1 billion in 2015, 
primarily because of the lower twelve-month average of  
the first-day-of-the-month historical reference oil price and 

removing overburden and waste material to access mineral 
deposits) incurred during the production phase of a mine  
are considered variable production costs and are included  
as a component of inventory produced during the period in 
which stripping costs are incurred. Major development 
expenditures, including stripping costs to prepare unique  
and identifiable areas outside the current mining area for 
future production that are considered to be pre-production 
mine development, are capitalized and amortized using  
the UOP method based on estimated recoverable proven  
and probable reserves for the ore body benefited. However, 
where a second or subsequent pit or major expansion is 
considered to be a continuation of existing mining activities, 
stripping costs are accounted for as a current production 
cost and a component of the associated inventory.

Environmental Obligations. Environmental expenditures  

are charged to expense or capitalized, depending upon their 
future economic benefits. Accruals for such expenditures  
are recorded when it is probable that obligations have been 
incurred and the costs can be reasonably estimated. 
Environmental obligations attributed to the Comprehensive 
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act  
of 1980 (CERCLA) or analogous state programs are 
considered probable when a claim is asserted, or is probable 
of assertion, and FCX, or any of its subsidiaries, have been 
associated with the site. Other environmental remediation 
obligations are considered probable based on specific facts 
and circumstances. FCX’s estimates of these costs are 
based on an evaluation of various factors, including currently 
available facts, existing technology, presently enacted laws 
and regulations, remediation experience, whether or not  
FCX is a potentially responsible party (PRP) and the ability of 
other PRPs to pay their allocated portions. With the 
exception of those obligations assumed in the acquisition  
of FMC that were initially recorded at estimated fair values 
(refer to Note 12 for further discussion), environmental 
obligations are recorded on an undiscounted basis. Where 
the available information is sufficient to estimate the amount 
of the obligation, that estimate has been used. Where the 
information is only sufficient to establish a range of probable 
liability and no point within the range is more likely than any 
other, the lower end of the range has been used. Possible 
recoveries of some of these costs from other parties are not 
recognized in the consolidated financial statements until they 

74

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

become probable. Legal costs associated with environmental 
remediation (such as fees to outside law firms for work 
relating to determining the extent and type of remedial actions 
and the allocation of costs among PRPs) are included as part 
of the estimated obligation.

At least annually, FCX reviews its ARO estimates for 

changes in the projected timing of certain reclamation and 
closure/restoration costs, changes in cost estimates and 
additional AROs incurred during the period. Refer to Note 12 
for further discussion.

Environmental obligations assumed in the acquisition of 

Revenue Recognition. FCX sells its products pursuant to 

FMC, which were initially recorded at fair value and estimated 
on a discounted basis, are accreted to full value over time 
through charges to interest expense. Adjustments arising 
from changes in amounts and timing of estimated costs  
and settlements may result in increases and decreases in 
these obligations and are calculated in the same manner as 
they were initially estimated. Unless these adjustments qualify 
for capitalization, changes in environmental obligations are 
charged to operating income when they occur.

FCX performs a comprehensive review of its environmental 

obligations annually and also reviews changes in facts  
and circumstances associated with these obligations at  
least quarterly.

Asset Retirement Obligations. FCX records the fair value  

of estimated asset retirement obligations (AROs) associated 
with tangible long-lived assets in the period incurred. 
Retirement obligations associated with long-lived assets are 
those for which there is a legal obligation to settle under 
existing or enacted law, statute, written or oral contract or by 
legal construction. These obligations, which are initially 
estimated based on discounted cash flow estimates, are 
accreted to full value over time through charges to cost  
of sales. In addition, asset retirement costs (ARCs) are 
capitalized as part of the related asset’s carrying value and 
are depreciated over the asset’s respective useful life.

For mining operations, reclamation costs for disturbances 

are recognized as an ARO and as a related ARC (included  
in property, plant, equipment and mine development costs) 
in the period of the disturbance and depreciated primarily  
on a UOP basis. FCX’s AROs for mining operations consist 
primarily of costs associated with mine reclamation and 
closure activities. These activities, which are site specific, 
generally include costs for earthwork, revegetation, water 
treatment and demolition.

For oil and gas properties, the fair value of the legal 

obligation is recognized as an ARO and as a related ARC 
(included in oil and gas properties) in the period in which  
the well is drilled or acquired and is amortized on a UOP 
basis together with other capitalized costs. Substantially all 
of FCX’s oil and gas leases require that, upon termination  
of economic production, the working interest owners plug 
and abandon non-producing wellbores; remove platforms, 
tanks, production equipment and flow lines; and restore  
the wellsite.

sales contracts entered into with its customers. Revenue for 
all FCX’s products is recognized when title and risk of loss 
pass to the customer and when collectibility is reasonably 
assured. The passing of title and risk of loss to the customer 
are based on terms of the sales contract, generally upon 
shipment or delivery of product.

Revenues from FCX’s concentrate and cathode sales are 

recorded based on a provisional sales price or a final sales 
price calculated in accordance with the terms specified  
in the relevant sales contract. Revenues from concentrate 
sales are recorded net of treatment and all refining charges 
and the impact of derivative contracts. Moreover, because  
a portion of the metals contained in copper concentrate  
is unrecoverable as a result of the smelting process, FCX’s 
revenues from concentrate sales are also recorded net  
of allowances based on the quantity and value of these 
unrecoverable metals. These allowances are a negotiated term 
of FCX’s contracts and vary by customer. Treatment and 
refining charges represent payments or price adjustments to 
smelters and refiners that are generally fixed.

Under the long-established structure of sales agreements 

prevalent in the mining industry, copper contained in 
concentrate and cathode is generally provisionally priced  
at the time of shipment. The provisional prices are finalized in  
a specified future month (generally one to four months  
from the shipment date) based on quoted monthly average 
spot copper prices on the London Metal Exchange (LME)  
or the Commodity Exchange Inc. (COMEX), a division of the 
New York Mercantile Exchange. FCX receives market  
prices based on prices in the specified future month, which 
results in price fluctuations recorded to revenues until  
the date of settlement. FCX records revenues and invoices 
customers at the time of shipment based on then-current 
LME or COMEX prices, which results in an embedded 
derivative (i.e., a pricing mechanism that is finalized after the 
time of delivery) that is required to be bifurcated from  
the host contract. The host contract is the sale of the metals 
contained in the concentrate or cathode at the then-current 
LME or COMEX price. FCX applies the normal purchases and 
normal sales scope exception in accordance with derivatives 
and hedge accounting guidance to the host contract in its 
concentrate or cathode sales agreements since these 
contracts do not allow for net settlement and always result in

appreciation rights (SARs), cash-settled RSUs and cash-
settled PSUs) is remeasured each reporting period using the 
Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model for SARs and 
FCX’s stock price for cash-settled RSUs and cash-settled 
PSUs. FCX has elected to recognize compensation costs for 
stock option awards and SARs that vest over several years on 
a straight-line basis over the vesting period, and for RSUs and 
cash-settled PSUs on the graded-vesting method over the 
vesting period. Refer to Note 10 for further discussion.

Earnings Per Share. FCX calculates its basic net income 

(loss) per share of common stock under the two-class 
method and calculates its diluted net income (loss) per share 
of common stock using the more dilutive of the two-class 
method or the treasury-stock method. Basic net income 
(loss) per share of common stock was computed by dividing 
net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders (after 
deducting accumulated dividends and undistributed earnings 
to participating securities) by the weighted-average shares  
of common stock outstanding during the year. Diluted net 
income (loss) per share of common stock was calculated by 
including the basic weighted-average shares of common 
stock outstanding adjusted for the effects of all potential 
dilutive shares of common stock, unless their effect would be 
anti-dilutive.

physical delivery. The embedded derivative does not qualify 
for hedge accounting and is adjusted to fair value through 
earnings each period, using the period-end forward prices, 
until the date of final pricing.

Gold sales are priced according to individual contract 

terms, generally the average London Bullion Market 
Association (London) price for a specified month near the 
month of shipment.

The majority of FCX’s molybdenum sales are priced based 
on the average published Metals Week price, plus conversion 
premiums for products that undergo additional processing, 
such as ferromolybdenum and molybdenum chemical 
products, for the month prior to the month of shipment.  
In 2015, FCX incorporated changes in the commercial pricing 
structure for its molybdenum-based chemical products to 
enable continuation of chemical-grade production.

PT-FI concentrate sales and Sociedad Minera Cerro Verde 

S.A.A. (Cerro Verde, a subsidiary of FMC) metal sales are 
subject to certain royalties, which are recorded as a 
reduction to revenues. In addition, PT-FI concentrate sales 
are also subject to export duties since 2014, which are 
recorded as a reduction to revenues. Refer to Note 13 for 
further discussion.

Oil and gas revenue from FCX’s interests in producing 

wells is recognized upon delivery and passage of title, net of 
any royalty interests or other profit interests in the produced 
product. Oil sales are primarily under contracts with prices 
based upon regional benchmarks. Gas sales are generally 
priced daily based on prices in the spot market. Gas revenue 
is recorded using the sales method for gas imbalances. If 
FCX’s sales of production volumes for a well exceed its 
portion of the estimated remaining recoverable reserves of 
the well, a liability is recorded. No receivables are recorded 
for those wells on which FCX has taken less than its 
ownership share of production unless the amount taken by 
other parties exceeds the estimate of their remaining 
reserves. There were no material gas imbalances at 
December 31, 2017.

Stock-Based Compensation. Compensation costs for 

share-based payments to employees are measured at fair 
value and charged to expense over the requisite service 
period for awards that are expected to vest. The fair value of 
stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes-Merton 
option valuation model. The fair value for stock-settled 
restricted stock units (RSUs) is based on FCX’s stock price  
on the date of grant. Shares of common stock are issued  
at the vesting date for stock-settled RSUs. The fair value of

New Accounting Standards. In May 2014, the Financial 

Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an Accounting 
Standards Update (ASU) that provides a single 
comprehensive revenue recognition model, which replaces 
most existing revenue recognition guidance, and also 
requires expanded disclosures. The core principle of the 
model is that revenue is recognized when control of goods or 
services has been transferred to customers at an amount  
that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to 
be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. FCX 
adopted this ASU January 1, 2018, under the modified 
retrospective approach applied to contracts that remain in 
force at the adoption date. FCX’s revenue is primarily  
derived from arrangements in which the transfer of risks and 
rewards coincides with the fulfillment of performance 
obligations, and FCX has concluded that the adoption of  
this ASU does not result in changes to its existing revenue 
recognition policies or processes, and does not result  
in any financial statement impacts. FCX will begin making  
the required revenue recognition disclosures under the  
ASU beginning with its March 31, 2018, quarterly report on 
Form 10-Q.

In January 2016, FASB issued an ASU that amends the 
current guidance on the classification and measurement  
of financial instruments. This ASU makes limited changes  
to existing guidance and amends certain disclosure 
requirements. For public entities, this ASU is effective for 
interim and annual periods beginning after December 15,  
2017. FCX adopted this ASU effective January 1, 2018,  
and adoption did not have a material impact on its financial 
statements.

In February 2016, FASB issued an ASU that will require 

lessees to recognize most leases on the balance sheet. This 
ASU allows lessees to make an accounting policy election  
to not recognize a lease asset and liability for leases with a 
term of 12 months or less and do not have a purchase  
option that is expected to be exercised. For public entities, 
this ASU is effective for interim and annual reporting periods 
beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption 
permitted. This ASU must be applied using the modified 
retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered 
into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period 
in the financial statements. FCX is currently evaluating the  
impact this guidance will have on its financial statements.

In June 2016, FASB issued an ASU that changes the 

impairment model for most financial assets and certain other 
instruments, and will also require expanded disclosures.  
For public entities, this ASU is effective for interim and annual 

2017 Annual Report

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with 
early adoption permitted. The provisions of the ASU must be 
applied as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained 
earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period  
in which the guidance is effective. FCX is currently evaluating 
the impact this ASU will have on its financial statements.

In November 2016, FASB issued an ASU that amends the 

classification and presentation of restricted cash and 
restricted cash equivalents on the statement of cash flows. 
The amendments require that a statement of cash flows 
explain the change during the period in the total of cash, 
cash equivalents and amounts generally described as 
restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. Therefore, 
amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted 
cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash 
equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and 
end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash 
flows. For public entities, this ASU is effective for interim and 
annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. 
FCX adopted this ASU effective January 1, 2018, and the 
statements of cash flows will be adjusted for all periods 
presented beginning with its March 31, 2018, quarterly report 
on Form 10-Q. The adoption of this ASU did not have a 
material impact on FCX’s financial statements.

In March 2017, FASB issued an ASU that changes how 

entities with a defined benefit pension or other postretirement 
benefit plans present net periodic benefit cost in the income 
statement. This ASU requires the service cost component of 
net periodic benefit cost to be presented in the same income 
statement line item or items as other compensation costs  
for those employees who are receiving the retirement benefit. 
In addition, only the service cost component is eligible for 
capitalization when applicable (i.e., as a cost of inventory or 
an internally constructed asset). The other components of 
net periodic benefit cost are required to be presented 
separately from the service cost component and outside of 
operating income. These other components of net periodic 
benefit cost are not eligible for capitalization, and the income 
statement line item or items must be disclosed. For public 
entities, this ASU is effective for interim and annual reporting 
periods beginning after December 15, 2017. FCX adopted  
this ASU effective January 1, 2018, and its statements of 
operations will be adjusted for all periods presented beginning 
with its March 31, 2018, quarterly report on Form 10-Q.  
The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on 
FCX’s financial statements.

NOTE 2. DISPOSITIONS

TF Holdings Limited—Discontinued Operations. FCX had a  
70 percent interest in TF Holdings Limited (TFHL), which 
owns 80 percent of Tenke Fungurume Mining S.A. (TFM or 
Tenke) located in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). 
On November 16, 2016, FCX completed the sale of its 
interest in TFHL to China Molybdenum Co., Ltd. (CMOC) for 
$2.65 billion in cash (before closing adjustments) and 
contingent consideration of up to $120 million in cash, 
consisting of $60 million if the average copper price exceeds 
$3.50 per pound and $60 million if the average cobalt price 
exceeds $20 per pound, both during calendar years 2018 and 
2019. One-half of the proceeds from this transaction was 
used to repay borrowings under FCX’s unsecured bank term 
loan. The contingent consideration is considered a derivative, 
and the fair value will be adjusted through December 31, 2019. 
The fair value of the contingent consideration derivative 
(included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets) 
was $74 million at December 31, 2017, and $13 million at 
December 31, 2016. Gains resulting from changes in the fair 
value of the contingent consideration derivative ($61 million in 
2017 and $13 million in 2016) are included in net income (loss) 
from discontinued operations and primarily resulted from 
higher cobalt prices. Future changes in the fair value of the 
contingent consideration derivative will continue to be 
recorded in discontinued operations.

In October 2016, La Générale des Carrières et des Mines 

(Gécamines), which is wholly owned by the DRC government 
and holds a 20 percent non-dilutable interest in TFM, filed  
an arbitration proceeding with the International Chamber of 
Commerce International Court of Arbitration challenging  
the sale of TFHL. In January 2017, a settlement agreement 
was entered into with Gécamines that resolved all claims 
brought by Gécamines against FCX, including the arbitration 
proceeding. The parties to the settlement are FCX, CMOC, 
Lundin Mining Corporation, TFHL, TFM, BHR Newwood 
Investment Management Limited and Gécamines. The 
settlement resulted in a charge of $33 million to the 2016 
loss on disposal. 

In accordance with accounting guidance, FCX reported  

the results of operations of TFHL as discontinued operations 
in the consolidated statements of operations because the 
disposal represents a strategic shift that had a major effect on 
operations. The consolidated statements of comprehensive 
income (loss) were not impacted by discontinued operations 
as TFHL did not have any other comprehensive income 
(loss), and the consolidated statements of cash flows are 
reported on a combined basis without separately presenting 
discontinued operations.

that was required to be repaid as a result of the sale of TFHL has been allocated to discontinued 
operations.

d.  Includes a gain of $61 million associated with the change in the fair value of contingent 

consideration.

Oil and Gas Operations. On July 31, 2017, FM O&G sold certain 
property interests in the Gulf of Mexico Shelf for cash 
consideration of $62 million (before closing adjustments from 
the April 1, 2017, effective date). On March 17, 2017, FM O&G 
sold property interests in the Madden area in central Wyoming 
for cash consideration of $17.5 million, before closing 
adjustments. Under the full cost accounting rules, the sales 
resulted in the recognition of gains of $49 million in 2017 
because the reserves associated with these properties were 
significant to the full cost pool.

On December 30, 2016, FM O&G completed the sale of its 

onshore California oil and gas properties to Sentinel Peak 
Resources California LLC (Sentinel) for cash consideration of 
$592 million (before closing adjustments from the July 1, 

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

2016, effective date) and contingent consideration of up to 
$150 million, consisting of $50 million per year for 2018,  
2019 and 2020 if the price of Brent crude oil averages over 
$70 per barrel in each of these calendar years. The 
contingent consideration is considered a derivative, and the 
fair value will be adjusted through the year 2020. The fair 
value of the contingent consideration derivative (included 
in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets) was  
$34 million at December 31, 2017, and $33 million at 
December 31, 2016. Future changes in the fair value of the 
contingent consideration derivative will continue to be 
recorded in operating income. Sentinel assumed 
abandonment obligations associated with the properties.

On December 15, 2016, FM O&G completed the sale  

of its Deepwater Gulf of Mexico (GOM) oil and gas properties 
to Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (Anadarko) for cash 
consideration of $2.0 billion (before closing adjustments 
from the August 1, 2016, effective date) and up to $150 million 
in contingent payments. The contingent payments were 
recorded under the loss recovery approach, whereby 
contingent gains are recorded up to the amount of any loss 
on the sale, and reduced the loss on the sale in 2016. The 
contingent payments were included in other current assets 
($24 million) and other assets ($126 million) at December 31, 
2017, and in other assets ($150 million) at December 31, 2016, 
in the consolidated balance sheets. The contingent payments 
will be received over time as Anadarko realizes future cash 
flows in connection with a third-party production handling 
agreement for an offshore platform. Anadarko assumed 
abandonment obligations associated with these properties. 
A portion of the proceeds from this transaction was used  
to repay FCX’s remaining outstanding borrowings under its 
unsecured bank term loan.

Under the full cost accounting rules, the sales of the 

Deepwater GOM and onshore California oil and gas properties 
required gain (loss) recognition (net loss of $9 million in  
2016, which was net of $150 million for contingent payments 
associated with the Deepwater GOM sale and $33 million  
for the fair value of contingent consideration from the 
onshore California sale) because of their significance to the 
full cost pool.

In connection with the sale of the Deepwater GOM oil and 

gas properties, FM O&G entered into an agreement to  
amend the terms of the Plains Offshore Operations Inc. 
(Plains Offshore) preferred stock obligation that was 
reported as redeemable noncontrolling interest on FCX’s 
financial statements. The amendment provided FM O&G the 
right to call these securities for $582 million. FM O&G 
exercised this option in December 2016 and recorded a  
$199 million gain on redemption to retained earnings.

2017 Annual Report

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

On July 25, 2016, FM O&G sold its Haynesville shale assets 

for cash consideration of $87 million, before closing 
adjustments. On June 17, 2016, FM O&G sold certain oil and 
gas royalty interests to Black Stone Minerals, L.P. for cash 
consideration of $102 million, before closing adjustments. 
Under the full cost accounting rules, the proceeds from these 
transactions were recorded as a reduction of capitalized  
oil and gas properties, with no gain or loss recognition in 
2016 because the reserves were not significant to the full 
cost pool.

Morenci. On May 31, 2016, FCX sold a 13 percent undivided 

interest in its Morenci unincorporated joint venture to  
SMM Morenci, Inc. for $1.0 billion in cash. FCX recorded a 
$576 million gain on the transaction and used losses to offset 
cash taxes on the transaction. A portion of the proceeds 
from the transaction was used to repay borrowings under 
FCX’s unsecured bank term loan and revolving credit facility.

The Morenci unincorporated joint venture was owned  

85 percent by FCX and 15 percent by Sumitomo. As a result 
of the transaction, the unincorporated joint venture is owned 
72 percent by FCX, 15 percent by Sumitomo and 13 percent 
by SMM Morenci, Inc.

Timok. On May 2, 2016, FMC sold an interest in the Timok 

exploration project in Serbia to Global Reservoir Minerals Inc. 
(now known as Nevsun Resources, Ltd.) for consideration  
of $135 million in cash and contingent consideration of up to 
$107 million payable to FCX in stages upon achievement of 
defined development milestones. As a result of this transaction, 
FCX recorded a gain of $133 million in 2016, and no amounts 
were recorded for contingent consideration under the  
loss recovery approach. A portion of the proceeds from the 
transaction was used to repay borrowings under FCX’s 
unsecured bank term loan.

Assets Held for Sale. Freeport Cobalt includes the large-

scale cobalt refinery in Kokkola, Finland, and the related  
sales and marketing business, in which FCX owns an 
effective 56 percent interest. Kisanfu is a copper and cobalt 
exploration project, located near Tenke, in which FCX owns  
a 100 percent interest. As a result of the sale of TFHL, FCX 
expects to sell its interest in Freeport Cobalt and Kisanfu, 
and the assets and liabilities of Freeport Cobalt and Kisanfu 
are classified as held for sale in the consolidated balance 
sheets. A $110 million estimated loss on disposal was included 
in net gain on sales of assets in 2016 in the consolidated 
statements of operations. FCX continues to market the 
Freeport Cobalt and Kisanfu assets and evaluate the fair 

value of these assets. During 2017, the fair value evaluations 
resulted in an increase to the estimated fair value less costs 
to sell of $13 million (included in net gain on sales of assets in 
the consolidated statements of operations).

NOTE 3. OWNERSHIP IN SUBSIDIARIES  
AND JOINT VENTURES

Ownership in Subsidiaries. FMC produces copper and 
molybdenum, with mines in North America and South America. 
At December 31, 2017, FMC’s operating mines in North 
America were Morenci, Bagdad, Safford, Sierrita and Miami 
located in Arizona; Tyrone and Chino located in New Mexico; 
and Henderson and Climax located in Colorado. FCX has  
a 72 percent interest (subsequent to the sale of a 13 percent 
undivided interest on May 31, 2016) in Morenci (refer to 
“Joint Ventures—Sumitomo and SMM Morenci, Inc.”) and 
owns 100 percent of the other North America mines. At 
December 31, 2017, operating mines in South America were 
Cerro Verde (53.56 percent owned) located in Peru and  
El Abra (51 percent owned) located in Chile. At December 31, 
2017, FMC’s net assets totaled $16.0 billion and its 
accumulated deficit totaled $14.0 billion. FCX had no loans 
outstanding to FMC at December 31, 2017.

FCX’s direct ownership in PT-FI totals 81.28 percent.  

PT Indocopper Investama, an Indonesian company, owns 
9.36 percent of PT-FI, and FCX owns 100 percent of  
PT Indocopper Investama. Refer to “Joint Ventures—Rio Tinto” 
for discussion of the unincorporated joint venture. At 
December 31, 2017, PT-FI’s net assets totaled $6.3 billion and 
its retained earnings totaled $6.0 billion. FCX had no loans 
outstanding to PT-FI at December 31, 2017.

FCX owns 100 percent of the outstanding Atlantic Copper 

common stock. At December 31, 2017, Atlantic Copper’s  
net liabilities totaled $40 million and its accumulated deficit 
totaled $452 million. FCX had $365 million in intercompany 
loans outstanding to Atlantic Copper at December 31, 2017.

FCX owns 100 percent of FM O&G, which, as of 

December 31, 2017, has oil and gas assets that primarily include 
oil and natural gas production onshore in South Louisiana  
and on the GOM Shelf and oil production offshore California. 
At December 31, 2017, FM O&G’s net liabilities totaled  
$13.7 billion and its accumulated deficit totaled $25.3 billion. 
FCX had $9.9 billion in intercompany loans outstanding to 
FM O&G at December 31, 2017.

Freeport-McMoRan

Joint Ventures. FCX has the following unincorporated 

joint ventures.

Rio Tinto. PT-FI and Rio Tinto have established an 

unincorporated joint venture pursuant to which Rio Tinto  
has a 40 percent interest in PT-FI’s Contract of Work (COW) 
and the option to participate in 40 percent of any other 
future exploration projects in Papua, Indonesia.

Pursuant to the joint venture agreement, Rio Tinto has a 
40 percent interest in certain assets and future production 
exceeding specified annual amounts of copper, gold and 
silver through 2022 in Block A of PT-FI’s COW, and, after 
2022, a 40 percent interest in all production from Block A. 
All of PT-FI’s proven and probable reserves and all its mining 
operations are located in the Block A area. PT-FI receives  
100 percent of production and related revenues from reserves 
established as of December 31, 1994 (27.1 billion pounds of 
copper, 38.4 million ounces of gold and 75.8 million ounces 
of silver), divided into annual portions subject to reallocation 
for events causing changes in the anticipated production 
schedule. Production and related revenues exceeding those 
annual amounts (referred to as incremental expansion 
revenues) are shared 60 percent PT-FI and 40 percent Rio Tinto. 
Operating, nonexpansion capital and administrative costs are 
shared 60 percent PT-FI and 40 percent Rio Tinto based on 
the ratio of (i) the incremental expansion revenues to (ii) total 
revenues from production from Block A, with PT-FI 
responsible for the rest of such costs. PT-FI will continue to 
receive 100 percent of the cash flow from specified annual 
amounts of copper, gold and silver through 2022 calculated 
by reference to its proven and probable reserves as of 
December 31, 1994, and 60 percent of all remaining cash 
flow. Expansion capital costs are shared 60 percent PT-FI 
and 40 percent Rio Tinto. The payable to Rio Tinto for its

2017 Annual Report

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FCX recorded $1.6 billion for VBPP in connection with the 
FMC acquisition in 2007 (excluding $634 million associated 
with mining operations that were sold or included in assets 
held for sale) and transferred $112 million to proven and 
probable mineral reserves during 2017 and $640 million prior 
to 2017 (none in 2016). Cumulative impairments of VBPP  
total $485 million, which were primarily recorded in 2008.

Capitalized interest, which primarily related to FCX’s 

mining operations’ capital projects, totaled $121 million in 2017, 
$92 million in 2016 and $157 million in 2015.

In connection with the decline in copper and molybdenum 

prices and revised operating plans at FCX’s mining operations, 
FCX evaluated its long-lived assets (other than indefinite-
lived intangible assets) for impairment during 2015 and as of 
December 31, 2015, as described in Note 1. FCX’s evaluations 
of its copper mines at December 31, 2015, were based on 
near-term price assumptions reflecting prevailing copper 
future prices, which ranged from $2.15 per pound to $2.17 
per pound for COMEX and from $2.13 per pound to $2.16 per 
pound for LME, and a long-term average price of $3.00  
per pound. FCX’s evaluations of its molybdenum mines at 
December 31, 2015, were based on near-term price 
assumptions that were consistent with then-current market 
prices for molybdenum and a long-term average price of 
$10.00 per pound.

FCX’s evaluations of long-lived assets (other than 

indefinite-lived intangible assets) resulted in the recognition 
of a charge to production costs for the impairment of the 
Tyrone mine totaling $37 million in 2015, net of a revision to 
Tyrone’s ARO.

During 2016 and 2017, FCX concluded there were no 

events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that 
the carrying amount of its long-lived mining assets might  
not be recoverable. Additionally, copper and molybdenum 
prices have improved. The LME copper spot prices were 
$3.25 per pound and $2.50 per pound at December 31, 2017 
and 2016, respectively, which were higher than the LME  
spot price of $2.13 per pound at December 31, 2015; the 
weekly average prices for molybdenum were $10.15 per 
pound and $6.74 per pound at December 31, 2017 and 2016, 
respectively, which were higher than the weekly average 
price of $5.23 per pound at December 31, 2015.

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Revolving Credit Facility. FCX, PT-FI and FM O&G LLC have a 
senior unsecured $3.5 billion revolving credit facility that 
matures on May 31, 2019, with $500 million available to PT-FI. 
At December 31, 2017, FCX had no borrowings outstanding 
and $13 million of letters of credit issued under the revolving 
credit facility, resulting in availability of approximately  
$3.5 billion, of which $1.5 billion could be used for additional 
letters of credit.

Interest on the revolving credit facility (London Interbank 

Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 2.25 percent or an alternate  
base rate (ABR) plus 1.25 percent at December 31, 2017) is 
determined by reference to FCX’s credit ratings and  
leverage ratio.

Cerro Verde Credit Facility. In March 2014, Cerro Verde 

entered into a five-year, $1.8 billion senior unsecured credit 
facility that is nonrecourse to FCX and the other shareholders 
of Cerro Verde. In June 2017, Cerro Verde’s credit facility  
was amended (balance outstanding at the time of 
amendment was $1.275 billion) to increase the commitment 
by $225 million to $1.5 billion, to modify the amortization 
schedule and to extend the maturity date to June 19, 2022. 
The amended credit facility amortizes in four installments, 
with $225 million due on December 31, 2020 (of which  
$220 million was prepaid during 2017), $225 million due on 
June 30, 2021, $525 million due on December 31, 2021,  
and the remaining balance due on the maturity date of  
June 19, 2022. All other terms, including the interest rates, 
remain the same. Interest under the term loan is based  
on LIBOR plus a spread (1.9 percent at December 31, 2017) 
based on Cerro Verde’s total net debt to earnings before 
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) ratio 
as defined in the agreement. The interest rate on Cerro Verde’s 
credit facility was 3.47 percent at December 31, 2017.

Cerro Verde Shareholder Loans. In December 2014, Cerro 

Verde entered into loan agreements with three of its 
shareholders for borrowings up to $800 million. In June 2017, 
Cerro Verde used the proceeds from its amended credit 
facility plus available cash to repay the balance of its 
outstanding shareholder loans. The remaining availability for 
borrowing under these agreements totals $200 million.
Senior Notes issued by FCX. In December 2016, FCX 

completed an exchange offer and consent solicitation 
associated with FM O&G LLC senior notes. Holders 
representing 89 percent of the outstanding FM O&G LLC 
senior notes tendered their notes and received new FCX 
senior notes. Each series of newly issued FCX senior notes 
have an interest rate that is identical to the interest rate  
of the applicable series of FM O&G LLC senior notes. The 
newly issued FCX senior notes are senior unsecured obligations 
of FCX and rank equally in right of payment with all other 
existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness of FCX.

The principal amounts were increased by $151 million to 
reflect the remaining unamortized acquisition-date fair market 
value adjustments associated with the PXP acquisition.  
In addition, FCX paid $14 million in cash consideration for  
FM O&G LLC’s senior notes that were tendered, which reduced 
the book value of the new FCX senior notes. All of these 
senior notes, except the 6.75% Senior Notes due 2022 and 
the 6⅞% Senior Notes due 2023, were redeemed during 2017 
(refer to Early Extinguishment and Exchanges of Debt in  
this note). The 6.75% Senior Notes due 2022 are currently 
redeemable in whole or in part, at the option of FCX, at a 
specified redemption price. The 6⅞% Senior Notes due 2023 
are redeemable in whole or in part, at the option of FCX,  
at a make-whole redemption price prior to February 15, 2020, 
and at a specified redemption price thereafter. As of 
December 31, 2017, the book value of these senior notes 
totaled $1.2 billion, which reflects the remaining unamortized 
acquisition-date fair market value adjustments ($81 million) 
and the cash consideration ($9 million) that are being 
amortized over the term of these senior notes and recorded 
as a net reduction of interest expense.

In November 2014, FCX sold $750 million of 2.30% Senior 

Notes due 2017 (which matured and were repaid in 2017), 
$600 million of 4.00% Senior Notes due 2021, $850 million of 
4.55% Senior Notes due 2024 and $800 million of 5.40% 
Senior Notes due 2034 for total net proceeds of $2.97 billion. 
In March 2013, in connection with the financing of FCX’s 
acquisitions of PXP and MMR, FCX issued $6.5 billion of 
unsecured senior notes in four tranches. FCX sold $1.5 billion 
of 2.375% Senior Notes due March 2018, $1.0 billion of 
3.100% Senior Notes due March 2020, $2.0 billion of 3.875% 
Senior Notes due March 2023 and $2.0 billion of 5.450% 
Senior Notes due March 2043 for total net proceeds of 
$6.4 billion. In February 2012, FCX sold $500 million of 2.15% 
Senior Notes due 2017 (which matured and were repaid  
in 2017) and $2.0 billion of 3.55% Senior Notes due 2022 for 
total net proceeds of $2.47 billion.

Senior Notes issued by FM O&G LLC. In May 2013, in 

connection with the acquisition of PXP, FCX assumed 
unsecured senior notes with a stated value of $6.4 billion, 
which was increased by $716 million to reflect the 
acquisition-date fair market value of these senior notes. After 
redemptions discussed below and the 2016 exchange offer 
and consent solicitation discussed above, as of December 31, 
2017, the 6⅞% Senior Notes due 2023 are the only remaining 
FM O&G LLC senior notes, and these senior notes are 
currently redeemable in whole or in part, at the option  
of FM O&G LLC, at a specified redemption price.

Early Extinguishment and Exchanges of Debt. During 2017, 

FCX redeemed in full or purchased in open-market

Partially offsetting the $54 million gain was $28 million in 
losses, primarily related to deferred debt issuance costs for 
an unsecured bank term loan that was repaid and costs 
associated with the December 2016 senior note exchange 
offer and consent solicitation.

Guarantees. In connection with the acquisition of PXP, FCX 

guaranteed the PXP senior notes, and the guarantees by 
certain PXP subsidiaries were released. Refer to Note 17 for a 
discussion of FCX’s senior notes guaranteed by FM O&G LLC.

Restrictive Covenants. FCX’s revolving credit facility 

contains customary affirmative covenants and representations, 
and also a number of negative covenants that, among other 
things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the ability  
of FCX’s subsidiaries that are not borrowers or guarantors  
to incur additional indebtedness (including guarantee 
obligations) and FCX’s ability or the ability of FCX’s subsidiaries 
to: create liens on assets; enter into sale and leaseback 
transactions; engage in mergers, liquidations and dissolutions; 
and sell assets. FCX’s revolving credit facility also contains 
financial ratios governing maximum total leverage and 
minimum interest coverage. FCX’s leverage ratio (Net Debt/
EBITDA, as defined in the credit agreement) cannot exceed 
3.75x, and the minimum interest coverage ratio (ratio of 
consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the credit agreement, to 
consolidated cash interest expense) is 2.25x. The pricing 
under the revolving credit facility is a function of credit ratings 
and the leverage ratio. FCX’s senior notes contain limitations 
on liens. At December 31, 2017, FCX was in compliance with 
all of its covenants. 

Maturities. Maturities of debt instruments based on the 

principal amounts and terms outstanding at December 31, 
2017, total $1.4 billion in 2018, none in 2019, $1.0 billion in 
2020, $1.4 billion in 2021, $2.8 billion in 2022 and $6.5 billion 
thereafter.

a.  Refer to Note 7 for current portion.

Pension Plans. Following is a discussion of FCX’s pension plans.

FMC Plans. FMC has U.S. trusteed, non-contributory 

pension plans covering substantially all of its U.S. employees 
and some employees of its international subsidiaries hired 
before 2007. The applicable FMC plan design determines the 
manner in which benefits are calculated for any particular 
group of employees. Benefits are calculated based on final 
average monthly compensation and years of service or based 
on a fixed amount for each year of service. Non-bargained 
FMC employees hired after December 31, 2006, are not eligible 
to participate in the FMC U.S. pension plan.

FCX’s funding policy for these plans provides that 

contributions to pension trusts shall be at least equal to the 
minimum funding requirements of the Employee Retirement 
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, for U.S. plans;  
or, in the case of international plans, the minimum legal 
requirements that may be applicable in the various countries. 
Additional contributions also may be made from time to time.

FCX’s policy for determining asset-mix targets for the  

FMC plan assets held in a master trust (Master Trust) includes 
the periodic development of asset allocation studies and 
review of the liabilities to determine expected long-term rates 
of return and expected risk for various investment portfolios. 
FCX’s retirement plan administration and investment 
committee considers these studies in the formal establishment 
of asset-mix targets defined in the investment policy. FCX’s 
investment objective emphasizes diversification through  
both the allocation of the Master Trust assets among various 
asset classes and the selection of investment managers 
whose various styles are fundamentally complementary to 

2017 Annual Report

85

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

one another and serve to achieve satisfactory rates of return. 
Diversification, by asset class and by investment manager,  
is FCX’s principal means of reducing volatility and exercising 
prudent investment judgment. FCX’s present target asset 
allocation approximates 50 percent equity investments 
(primarily global equities), 43 percent fixed income (primarily 
long-term treasury STRIPS or “separate trading or registered 
interest and principal securities”; long-term U.S. treasury/
agency bonds; global fixed income securities; long-term, 
high-credit quality corporate bonds; high-yield and emerging 
markets fixed income securities; and fixed income debt 
securities) and 7 percent alternative investments (private real 
estate, real estate investment trusts and private equity).

The expected rate of return on plan assets is evaluated at 

least annually, taking into consideration asset allocation, 
historical and expected future performance on the types of 
assets held in the Master Trust, and the current economic 
environment. Based on these factors, FCX expects the 
pension assets will earn an average of 6.5 percent per annum 
beginning January 1, 2018. The 6.5 percent estimation  
was based on a passive return on a compound basis of  
6.0 percent and a premium for active management of  
0.5 percent reflecting the target asset allocation and current 
investment array.

For estimation purposes, FCX assumes the long-term asset 

mix for these plans generally will be consistent with the 
current mix. Changes in the asset mix could impact the amount 
of recorded pension costs, the funded status of the plans  
and the need for future cash contributions. A lower-than-
expected return on assets also would decrease plan assets 
and increase the amount of recorded pension costs in future 
years. When calculating the expected return on plan assets, 
FCX uses the market value of assets.

Among the assumptions used to estimate the pension 

benefit obligation is a discount rate used to calculate the 
present value of expected future benefit payments for 
service to date. The discount rate assumption for FCX’s U.S. 
plans is designed to reflect yields on high-quality, fixed-
income investments for a given duration. The determination 
of the discount rate for these plans is based on expected 
future benefit payments for service to date together with  
the Mercer Pension Discount Curve—Above Mean Yield. The 
Mercer Pension Discount Curve—Above Mean Yield is 
constructed from the bonds in the Mercer Pension Discount 
Curve that have a yield higher than the regression mean yield 
curve. The Mercer Pension Discount Curve consists of spot 
(i.e., zero coupon) interest rates at one-half-year increments 

for each of the next 30 years and is developed based on 
pricing and yield information for high-quality corporate 
bonds. Changes in the discount rate are reflected in FCX’s 
benefit obligation and, therefore, in future pension costs.

SERP Plan. FCX has an unfunded Supplemental Executive 

Retirement Plan (SERP) for its chief executive officer. The 
SERP provides for retirement benefits payable in the form of 
a joint and survivor annuity, life annuity or an equivalent lump 
sum, which is determined on January 1 of the year in which 
the participant completed 25 years of credited service. The 
annuity will equal a percentage of the participant’s highest 
average compensation for any consecutive three-year period 
during the five years immediately preceding the completion 
of 25 years of credited service. The SERP benefit will be 
reduced by the value of all benefits from current and former 
retirement plans (qualified and nonqualified) sponsored by 
FCX, by FM Services Company, FCX’s wholly owned 
subsidiary, or by any predecessor employer (including FCX’s 
former parent company), except for benefits produced by 
accounts funded exclusively by deductions from the 
participant’s pay.

PT-FI Plan. PT-FI has a defined benefit pension plan 

denominated in Indonesian rupiah covering substantially all 
of its Indonesian national employees. PT-FI funds the plan 
and invests the assets in accordance with Indonesian 
pension guidelines. The pension obligation was valued at an 
exchange rate of 13,480 rupiah to one U.S. dollar on 
December 31, 2017, and 13,369 rupiah to one U.S. dollar on 
December 31, 2016. Indonesian labor laws require that 
companies provide a minimum level of benefits to employees 
upon employment termination based on the reason for 
termination and the employee’s years of service. PT-FI’s 
pension benefit obligation includes benefits related to this 
law. PT-FI’s expected rate of return on plan assets is 
evaluated at least annually, taking into consideration its 
long-range estimated return for the plan based on the  
asset mix. Based on these factors, PT-FI expects its pension 
assets will earn an average of 7.75 percent per annum 
beginning January 1, 2018. The discount rate assumption for 
PT-FI’s plan is based on the Mercer Indonesian zero coupon 
bond yield curve derived from the Indonesian Government 
Security Yield Curve. Changes in the discount rate are 
reflected in PT-FI’s benefit obligation and, therefore, in future 
pension costs.

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Actuarial losses in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the 
projected benefit obligation or market-related value of plan 
assets are amortized over the expected average remaining 
future service period of the current active participants. The 
amount expected to be recognized in 2018 net periodic 
pension cost for actuarial losses is $47 million.

FCX does not expect to have any plan assets returned to it 
in 2018. Plan assets are classified within a fair value hierarchy 
that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to 
measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to 
unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical 
assets or liabilities (Level 1), then to significant observable 
inputs (Level 2) and the lowest priority to significant 
unobservable inputs (Level 3).

Following is a description of the pension plan asset categories 
and the valuation techniques used to measure fair value. 
There have been no changes to the techniques used to measure 
fair value.

Commingled/collective funds are managed by several  

fund managers and are valued at the NAV per unit of the fund. 
For most of these funds, the majority of the underlying 
assets are actively traded securities. These funds (except the 
real estate property fund) require up to a 60-day notice  
for redemptions. The real estate property fund is valued at 
NAV using information from independent appraisal firms, 
who have knowledge and expertise about the current market 
values of real property in the same vicinity as the 
investments. Redemptions of the real estate property fund 
are allowed once per quarter, subject to available cash.
Fixed income investments include government and 

corporate bonds held directly by the Master Trust. Fixed 
income securities are valued using a bid-evaluation price or  
a mid-evaluation price and, as such, are classified within 
Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. A bid-evaluation price is an 
estimated price at which a dealer would pay for a security.  
A mid-evaluation price is the average of the estimated  
price at which a dealer would sell a security and the 
estimated price at which a dealer would pay for a security. 
These evaluations are based on quoted prices, if available,  
or models that use observable inputs.

Common stocks included in global large-cap equity 

securities and preferred stocks included in other investments 
are valued at the closing price reported on the active market 
on which the individual securities are traded and, as such, are 
classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Postretirement and Other Benefits. FCX also provides 
postretirement medical and life insurance benefits for certain 
U.S. employees and, in some cases, employees of certain 
international subsidiaries. These postretirement benefits vary 
among plans, and many plans require contributions from 
retirees. The expected cost of providing such postretirement 
benefits is accrued during the years employees render service.

The benefit obligation (funded status) for the 

postretirement medical and life insurance benefit plans 
consisted of a current portion of $14 million (included in 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities) and a long-term 
portion of $129 million (included in other liabilities) at 
December 31, 2017, and a current portion of $16 million and a 
long-term portion of $138 million at December 31, 2016.  
The discount rate used to determine the benefit obligation for 
these plans, which was determined on the same basis as 
FCX’s pension plans, was 3.50 percent at December 31, 2017, 
and 3.80 percent at December 31, 2016. Expected benefit 
payments for these plans total $14 million for 2018, $14 million 
for 2019, $13 million for 2020, $13 million for 2021, $12 million 
for 2022 and $50 million for 2023 through 2027.

The net periodic benefit cost charged to operations for 

FCX’s postretirement benefits (primarily for interest costs) 
totaled $5 million in 2017, $4 million in 2016 and $6 million in 
2015. The discount rate used to determine net periodic 
benefit cost and the components of net periodic benefit 
cost for FCX’s postretirement benefits was 3.80 percent in 
2017, 4.10 percent in 2016 and 3.60 percent in 2015. The 
medical-care trend rates assumed the first year trend rate 
was 8.00 percent at December 31, 2017, which declines over 
the next 15 years with an ultimate trend rate of 4.25 percent.

FCX has a number of postemployment plans covering 

severance, long-term disability income, continuation of 
health and life insurance coverage for disabled employees or 
other welfare benefits. The accumulated postemployment 
benefit consisted of a current portion of $5 million (included 
in accounts payable and accrued liabilities) and a long-term 
portion of $38 million (included in other liabilities) at 
December 31, 2017, and a current portion of $5 million and a 
long-term portion of $34 million at December 31, 2016. In 
connection with the retirement of one of its executive officers 
in December 2015, FCX recorded a charge to selling, general 
and administrative expenses of $16 million.

FCX also sponsors savings plans for the majority of its 

U.S. employees. The plans allow employees to contribute a 
portion of their pre-tax income in accordance with specified 
guidelines. These savings plans are principally qualified 
401(k) plans for all U.S. salaried and non-bargained hourly 
employees. In these plans, participants exercise control and 
direct the investment of their contributions and account 

Private equity investments are valued at NAV using 

information from general partners and have inherent

Following is a description of the valuation techniques used 
for pension plan assets measured at fair value associated 
with the PT-FI plan. There have been no changes to the 
techniques used to measure fair value.

Common stocks, government bonds and mutual funds are 

valued at the closing price reported on the active market  
on which the individual securities are traded and, as such, are 
classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.

The techniques described above may produce a fair value 

calculation that may not be indicative of NRV or reflective  
of future fair values. Furthermore, while FCX believes its 
valuation techniques are appropriate and consistent with 
those used by other market participants, the use of different 
techniques or assumptions to determine the fair value of 
certain financial instruments could result in a different fair 
value measurement at the reporting date.

pension plans follow:

balances among various investment options. FCX contributes 
to these plans at varying rates and matches a percentage of 
employee pre-tax deferral contributions up to certain  
limits, which vary by plan. For employees whose eligible 
compensation exceeds certain levels, FCX provides an 
unfunded defined contribution plan, which had a liability 
balance of $46 million at December 31, 2017, and  
$47 million at December 31, 2016, all of which was included  
in other liabilities.

The costs charged to operations for employee savings plans 

totaled $65 million in 2017 (none of which was capitalized), 
$78 million in 2016 (of which $4 million was capitalized to oil 
and gas properties) and $98 million in 2015 (of which  
$13 million was capitalized to oil and gas properties). FCX  
has other employee benefit plans, certain of which are 
related to FCX’s financial results, which are recognized in 
operating costs.

Restructuring Charges. As a result of the first-quarter 2017 

regulatory restrictions and uncertainties regarding long-term 
investment stability, PT-FI took actions to adjust its cost 
structure, reduce its workforce and slow investments in its 
underground development projects and new smelter (refer 
to Note 13 for further discussion). These actions included 
workforce reductions through furlough and voluntary 
retirement programs. Following the furlough and voluntary 
retirement programs, a significant number of employees  
and contractors elected to participate in an illegal strike 
action beginning in May 2017, and were subsequently deemed 
to have voluntarily resigned under the existing Indonesian 
laws and regulations. As a result, PT-FI recorded charges in 
2017 to production costs of $120 million, and selling, 
general and administrative costs of $5 million for employee 
severance and related costs, and a pension curtailment  
loss of $4 million included in production costs.

In early 2016, FCX restructured its oil and gas business  

to reduce costs and in late 2016, FCX sold substantially all  
of its remaining oil and gas properties. As a result, FCX 
recorded charges of $85 million to selling, general and 
administrative expenses and $6 million to production costs 
for net restructuring-related costs in 2016.

Because of a decline in commodity prices, FCX made 

adjustments to its operating plans for its mining operations in 
2015 (refer to Note 5 for further discussion). As a result of 
these revisions to its mining operating plans, FCX recorded 
restructuring charges to production costs in 2015 of  
$45 million primarily for employee severance and benefit 
costs, and $22 million for special retirement benefits.

NOTE 10. STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY  
AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

FCX’s authorized shares of capital stock total 3.05 billion 
shares, consisting of 3 billion shares of common stock and  
50 million shares of preferred stock.

Common Stock. In November 2016, FCX completed a  

$1.5 billion registered at-the-market equity offering of 
common stock that was announced on July 27, 2016. FCX 
sold 116.5 million shares of its common stock at an average 
price of $12.87 per share, which generated gross proceeds  
of $1.5 billion (net proceeds of $1.48 billion after $15 million  
of commissions and expenses).

During 2016, FCX issued 48.1 million shares of its common 

stock (with a value of $540 million, excluding $5 million of 
commissions paid by FCX) in connection with the settlement 
of two drilling rig contracts.

Also during 2016, FCX negotiated private exchange 

transactions exempt from registration under the Securities 
Act of 1933, as amended, whereby 27.7 million shares of 
FCX’s common stock were issued (with an aggregate value  
of $311 million), in exchange for $369 million principal amount 
of FCX’s senior notes.

In September 2015, FCX completed a $1.0 billion  

at-the-market equity program and announced an additional  
$1.0 billion at-the-market equity program. Through 
December 31, 2015, FCX sold 205.7 million shares of its 
common stock at an average price of $9.53 per share under 
these programs, which generated gross proceeds of  
$1.96 billion (net proceeds of $1.94 billion after $20 million  
of commissions and expenses). From January 1, 2016, 
through January 5, 2016, FCX sold 4.3 million shares of its 
common stock, which generated proceeds of $29 million 
(after $0.3 million of commissions and expenses). FCX used 
the proceeds to repay indebtedness.

The Board of Directors (the Board) declared a one-time 

special cash dividend of $0.1105 per share related to the 
settlement of the shareholder derivative litigation, which was 
paid in August 2015. In response to the impact of lower 
commodity prices, the Board authorized a decrease in the 
cash dividend on FCX’s common stock from an annual  
rate of $1.25 per share to an annual rate of $0.20 per share  
in March 2015, and then suspended the cash dividend in 
December 2015. Refer to Note 18 for discussion of the 
reinstated cash dividend on FCX’s common stock. The 
declaration of dividends is at the discretion of the Board 
and will depend on FCX’s financial results, cash requirements, 
future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by  
the Board.

Stock Award Plans. FCX currently has awards outstanding 
under various stock-based compensation plans. The 
stockholder-approved 2016 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2016 
Plan) provides for the issuance of stock options, SARs, 
restricted stock, RSUs, PSUs and other stock-based awards 
for up to 72 million common shares. As of December 31, 2017, 
64.7 million shares were available for grant under the 2016 
Plan, and no shares were available under other plans.

Stock Options and SARs. Stock options granted under the 
plans generally expire 10 years after the date of grant and 
vest in 25 percent annual increments beginning one year 
from the date of grant. The award agreements provide that 
participants will receive the following year’s vesting upon 
retirement. Therefore, on the date of grant, FCX accelerates 
one year of amortization for retirement-eligible employees. 
Stock options provide for accelerated vesting only upon 
certain qualifying terminations of employment within one 
year following a change of control. SARs generally expire 
within five years after the date of grant and vest in one-third 

annual increments beginning one year from the date of grant. 
SARs are similar to stock options, but are settled in cash 
rather than in shares of common stock and are classified as 
liability awards.

A summary of options and SARs outstanding as of 

December 31, 2017, including 716,469 SARs, and activity

The fair value of each stock option is estimated on the date 
of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation 
model. The fair value of each SAR is determined using the 
Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model and remeasured 
at each reporting date until the date of settlement. Expected 
volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded options 
on FCX’s common stock and historical volatility of FCX’s 
common stock. FCX uses historical data to estimate future 
option and SAR exercises, forfeitures and expected life. 
When appropriate, separate groups of employees who have 
similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately 
for valuation purposes. The expected dividend rate is 
calculated using the annual dividend (excluding supplemental 
dividends) at the date of grant. The risk-free interest rate

As of December 31, 2017, FCX had $24 million of total 
unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock 
options expected to be recognized over a weighted-average 
period of approximately 2.0 years.

Stock-Settled PSUs and RSUs. Beginning in 2014, FCX’s 

executive officers were granted PSUs that vest after three 
years. For the PSUs granted to the executive officers in  
2015, the final number of shares to be issued to the executive 
officers is based on FCX’s total shareholder return compared 
to the total shareholder return of a peer group. The total 
grant date target shares related to the PSU grants were  
755 thousand in 2015, and executive officers received no 
shares at maturity based on FCX’s total shareholder return 
compared to its peers. For the PSUs granted in 2017 and 
2016, the final number of shares to be issued to the executive 
officers will be determined based on (i) FCX’s achievement  
of certain financial and operational performance metrics and 
(ii) FCX’s total shareholder return compared to the shareholder 
return of a peer group. The total grant date target shares 
related to the PSU grants were 0.6 million for 2017 and  
1.5 million for 2016, of which the executive officers will earn 
(i) between 0 percent and 175 percent of the target shares 
based on achievement of financial and operating metrics and 
(ii) +/- 25 percent of the target shares based on FCX’s total 
shareholder return compared to the peer group.

All of FCX’s executive officers are retirement eligible, and 

their PSU awards are therefore non-forfeitable. As such,  
FCX charges the estimated fair value of the PSU awards to 
expense at the time the financial and operational metrics  
are established.

Freeport-McMoRan

FCX grants RSUs that vest over a period of three years to 

certain employees. FCX also grants RSUs to its directors. 
Beginning in December 2015, RSUs granted to directors vest 
on the first anniversary of the grant. Prior to December 2015, 
RSUs granted to directors generally vest over a period of 
four years. The fair value of the RSUs is amortized over the 
vesting period or the period until the director becomes 
retirement eligible, whichever is shorter. Upon a director’s 
retirement, all of their unvested RSUs immediately vest.  
For retirement-eligible directors, the fair value of RSUs is 
recognized in earnings on the date of grant.

The award agreements provide for accelerated vesting of 
all RSUs held by directors if there is a change of control (as 
defined in the award agreements) and for accelerated vesting 
of all RSUs held by employees if they experience a qualifying 
termination within one year following a change of control.

Dividends attributable to RSUs and PSUs accrue and are 

paid if the award vests. A summary of outstanding stock-
settled RSUs and PSUs as of December 31, 2017, and activity

a.  Excludes 374 thousand PSUs related to 2017 grants and 497 thousand PSUs related to 2016 grants 

for which the performance metrics have not yet been established. 

The total fair value of stock-settled RSUs and PSUs granted 
was $32 million during 2017, $37 million during 2016 and  
$46 million during 2015. The total intrinsic value of stock-settled 
RSUs vested was $45 million during 2017, and $22 million 
during both 2016 and 2015. As of December 31, 2017, FCX had 
$6 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related 
to unvested stock-settled RSUs expected to be recognized 
over approximately 1.4 years.

Cash-Settled RSUs and PSUs. Cash-settled RSUs are similar 
to stock-settled RSUs, but are settled in cash rather than in 
shares of common stock. These cash-settled RSUs generally 
vest over periods ranging from three to five years of service. 
The award agreements for cash-settled RSUs provide for 
accelerated vesting upon certain qualifying terminations of 
employment within one year following a change of control 
(as defined in the award agreements).

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

In 2015, certain members of FM O&G’s senior management 

NOTE 11. INCOME TAXES

were granted cash-settled PSUs that vest over three years. 
The total grant date target shares related to the 2015 
cash-settled PSU grants were 582 thousand shares, of which 
FM O&G’s senior management earned a total of 487 thousand 
shares at maturity based on the achievement of applicable 
performance goals. 

The cash-settled PSUs and RSUs are classified as liability 

awards, and the fair value of these awards is remeasured 
each reporting period until the vesting dates.

Dividends attributable to cash-settled RSUs and PSUs 

accrue and are paid if the award vests. A summary of

Tax Attributes. At December 31, 2017, FCX had (i) U.S. foreign 
tax credits of $2.1 billion that will expire between 2018 and 
2027, (ii) U.S. federal net operating losses of $6.4 billion that 
expire between 2032 and 2036, (iii) U.S. federal capital 
losses of $160 million that expire in 2021 and 2022, (iv) U.S. 
state net operating losses of $10.6 billion that expire between 
2018 and 2037 and (v) Spanish net operating losses of  
$566 million that can be carried forward indefinitely. 

Valuation Allowance. On the basis of available information 

at December 31, 2017, including positive and negative 
evidence, FCX has provided valuation allowances for certain 
of its deferred tax assets where it believes it is more likely 
than not that some portion or all of such assets will not be 
realized. Valuation allowances totaled $4.6 billion at 
December 31, 2017, and $6.1 billion at December 31, 2016, and 
covered all of FCX’s U.S. foreign tax credits, U.S. federal net 
operating losses, U.S. federal capital losses, foreign net 
operating losses, and substantially all of its U.S. state net 
operating losses. FCX’s valuation allowances at December 31, 
2016, also covered substantially all of its U.S. AMT credits.

The valuation allowance related to FCX’s U.S. foreign tax 

credits totaled $2.1 billion at December 31, 2017. FCX has 
operations in tax jurisdictions where statutory income taxes 
and withholding taxes are in excess of the U.S. federal income 
tax rate. Valuation allowances are recorded on foreign  
tax credits for which no benefit is expected to be realized.

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The valuation allowance related to FCX’s U.S. federal,  

state and foreign net operating losses totaled $2.1 billion at 
December 31, 2017, including $280 million related to FCX’s 
U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets 
represent future deductions for which a benefit will only be 
realized to the extent these deductions offset future income. 
FCX develops an estimate of which future tax deductions  
will be realized and provides a valuation allowance to the 
extent these deductions are not expected to be realized  
in future periods.

Valuation allowances will continue to be carried on U.S. 

foreign tax credits and U.S. federal, state and foreign net 
operating losses until such time that (i) FCX generates taxable 
income against which any of the assets, credits or net 
operating losses can be used, (ii) forecasts of future income 
provide sufficient positive evidence to support reversal of  
the valuation allowances or (iii) FCX identifies a prudent and 
feasible means of securing the benefit of the assets, credits  
or net operating losses that can be implemented.

The $1.5 billion net decrease in the valuation allowances 

during 2017 primarily related to a $1.1 billion decrease 
associated with a reduction in the corporate income tax rate 
applicable to U.S. federal deferred tax assets (refer to “Tax 
Reform” below for further discussion) and $371 million for the 
reversal of valuation allowances on U.S. federal AMT credits. 
FCX will continue to assess whether its valuation allowances 
are effected by various aspects of the Act.

Tax Reform. The Act, which was enacted on December 22, 

2017, includes significant modifications to existing U.S. tax 
laws and creates many new complex tax provisions. The Act 
reduces the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent, 
eliminates the corporate AMT, provides for a refund of AMT 
credits, maintains hard minerals percentage depletion, allows 
for immediate expensing of certain qualified property  
and generally broadens the tax base. The Act also creates a 
territorial tax system (with a one-time mandatory tax on 
previously deferred foreign earnings), creates anti-base erosion 
rules that require companies to pay a minimum tax on 
foreign earnings and disallows certain payments from U.S. 
corporations to foreign related parties. 

As further described below, FCX has made reasonable 

estimates of the tax effects related to its existing deferred 
tax balances, AMT credit refunds and the transition tax. 
While FCX has not completed its analysis, its 2017 income tax 
provision includes provisional net tax benefits associated 

with the Act totaling $393 million, which includes $272 million 
(net of reserves) for the reversal of valuation allowances 
associated with anticipated refunds of AMT credits and  
$121 million for the decrease in corporate income tax rates. 
For certain provisions of the Act, FCX has not been able to 
make a reasonable estimate. For these items, FCX’s accounting 
continues to be based on existing income tax accounting 
guidance and the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect 
immediately prior to enactment of the Act. FCX will 
continue to refine its calculations as it gains a more thorough 
understanding of the Act.

Elimination of Corporate AMT and Refund of AMT Credits. For 

tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the corporate 
AMT was repealed. FCX has historically incurred an AMT liability 
in excess of regular tax liability, resulting in accumulated  
AMT credits totaling $490 million as of December 31, 2017. 
The Act allows the use of existing corporate AMT credits  
to offset regular tax liability for tax years after December 31, 
2017. AMT credits in excess of regular liability are refundable  
in the years 2018 through 2021.

At December 31, 2016, FCX had estimated a $72 million 

benefit for AMT credits, and during 2017 recognized a  
$38 million benefit, all of which was expected to be refunded 
under prior tax law. As a result of the Act, FCX recognized  
an additional net benefit of $272 million in 2017, consisting of 
a $380 million tax benefit for additional historical AMT credits 
expected to be refunded, partially offset by a $108 million  
tax charge to establish a reserve for uncertain tax positions. 
FCX will continue to refine these provisional amounts as 
historical data is gathered and analyzed.

Reduction in Corporate Income Tax Rate. The Act reduces the 

U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to  
21 percent. While applicable for years after December 31, 2017, 
existing income tax accounting guidance requires the 
effects of changes in tax rates and laws on deferred tax 
balances to be recognized in the period in which the legislation 
is enacted. In fourth-quarter 2017, FCX recognized this change 
in the federal statutory rate and recorded a net benefit of  
$121 million, consisting of a $1.1 billion tax benefit associated 
with changes in related valuation allowances, partly offset  
by a $975 million tax charge related to existing net U.S. federal 
deferred tax assets and liabilities. FCX will continue to  
refine these provisional amounts as further analysis of the 
laws’ impacts are completed, including effects on U.S. state 
income taxes and the realizability of deferred tax assets  
in future years.

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Transition Tax on Previously Deferred Foreign Earnings. Under 

Executive Compensation Limitation. For tax years beginning 

the Act, U.S. shareholders owning at least 10 percent of a 
foreign subsidiary generally must recognize taxable income 
equal to the shareholder’s pro rata share of accumulated 
post-1986 historical Earnings and Profits (E&P). The portion 
of any E&P associated with cash or cash equivalents is  
taxed at a rate of 15.5 percent, while any remaining E&P is 
taxed at a reduced rate of 8 percent. The resulting tax liability 
(Transition Tax) may be reduced by available foreign tax 
credits. Because FCX operates in foreign jurisdictions with 
statutory tax rates in excess of the U.S. historical statutory 
tax rate of 35 percent, the Transition Tax is fully offset by 
foreign tax credits generated in the current year. Although 
its 2017 income tax provision was not impacted by this 
one-time Transition Tax liability, FCX has yet to complete its 
final calculation of the total accumulated post-1986 E&P.  
As a result, FCX’s estimate of Transition Tax may change 
when the underlying calculations are finalized.

Anti-Base Erosion Rules. For tax years that begin after 

December 31, 2017, applicable taxpayers are required to pay 
the Base Erosion Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT). BEAT is an 
alternative tax calculation that disallows deduction of certain 
amounts paid or accrued by a U.S. taxpayer to a foreign 
related party. The new BEAT rules are complex, and FCX is 
evaluating this provision in the context of its global structure 
and operations and existing tax accounting guidance.  
Based on FCX’s current evaluations, it is unclear if BEAT will 
impact FCX, and no adjustments were made related to  
BEAT in its 2017 income tax provision.

The Act also includes provisions to tax a new class of 

income called Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI). 
Because of the complexity of the new GILTI tax rules,  
FCX is continuing to evaluate this provision of the Act and 
the application of existing income tax accounting guidance. 
Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, FCX  
is allowed to make an accounting policy choice of either  
(i) treating taxes due on future U.S. inclusions in taxable 
income related to GILTI as a current period expense when 
incurred or (ii) factoring such amounts into the measurement 
of deferred taxes. FCX has not made a policy decision 
regarding whether to record deferred taxes on GILTI, and  
the selection of an accounting policy will depend, in part,  
on analyzing its global income to determine whether FCX 
expects to have future U.S. inclusions and, if so, what 
impact is expected. No adjustments were made related to 
potential GILTI tax in FCX’s 2017 income tax provision.

after December 31, 2017, tax deductible compensation of 
covered employees is limited to $1 million. In addition, the 
definition of covered employees is revised to include the 
principal executive officer, the principal financial officer and 
the three other highest paid officers. If an individual is a 
covered employee for a tax year beginning after December 31, 
2016, the individual remains a covered employee for all 
future years. Under a transition rule, the changes do not apply 
to any remuneration under specified contracts in effect on 
November 2, 2017. FCX is continuing to analyze the impacts 
of this provision. No adjustments were made related to the 
future disallowance of executive compensation in FCX’s 2017 
income tax provision.

Other. As of December 31, 2017, FCX has offset $5.3 billion 

of foreign source income with U.S. source losses. Under 
existing U.S. tax law, FCX has the ability to re-characterize 
$5.3 billion of future U.S. source income into foreign source 
income. While utilization of U.S. foreign tax credits is 
dependent upon FCX generating future U.S. tax liabilities 
within the carryforward period, this re-sourcing may  
permit FCX to utilize up to $1.1 billion of the $2.1 billion foreign 
tax credits that would otherwise expire unused. FCX 
continues to evaluate the impact of the Act on these income 
re-sourcing provisions. 

Other Events. In October 2017, the Peruvian Supreme Court 

issued a ruling in favor of SUNAT, Peru’s national tax 
authority, that the assessments of royalties for the year 2008 
on ore processed by the Cerro Verde concentrator were 
proper under Peruvian law. SUNAT has assessed mining 
royalties on ore processed by the Cerro Verde concentrator 
for the period December 2006 to December 2011, which 
Cerro Verde has contested on the basis that its 1998 stability 
agreement exempts from royalties all minerals extracted 
from its mining concessions, irrespective of the method used 
for processing those minerals. As a result of the unfavorable 
Peruvian Supreme Court decision, FCX incurred pre-tax 
charges of $348 million and $7 million of net income tax 
expense for the year 2017, consisting of tax charges of  
$136 million for disputed royalties and other related mining 
taxes for the period October 2011 through the year 2013 
(when royalties were determined based on operating income), 
mostly offset by a tax benefit of $129 million associated  
with disputed royalties and other related mining taxes for 
the period December 2006 through the year 2013. Refer to 
Note 12 for further discussion.

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

In December 2016, the Peruvian parliament passed tax 

Uncertain Tax Positions. FCX accounts for uncertain income 

legislation that, in part, modified the applicable tax rates 
established in its December 2014 tax legislation, which 
progressively decreased the corporate income tax rate from 
30 percent in 2014 to 26 percent in 2019 and thereafter, and 
also increased the dividend tax rate on distributions from  
4.1 percent in 2014 to 9.3 percent in 2019 and thereafter. Under 
the tax legislation, which was effective January 1, 2017, the 
corporate income tax rate was 29.5 percent, and the dividend 
tax rate on distributions of earnings was 5 percent. Cerro 
Verde’s current mining stability agreement subjects FCX to a 
stable income tax rate of 32 percent through the expiration 
of the agreement on December 31, 2028. The tax rate  
on dividend distributions is not stabilized by the agreement. 

During 2015, PT-FI’s Delaware domestication was 

terminated. As a result, PT-FI is no longer a U.S. income tax 
filer, and tax attributes related to PT-FI, which were fully 
reserved with a related valuation allowance, are no longer 
available for use in FCX’s U.S. federal consolidated income 
tax return. There was no resulting net impact to FCX’s 
consolidated statement of operations. PT-FI remains a limited 
liability company organized under Indonesian law.

In September 2014, the Chilean legislature approved a tax 

reform package that implemented a dual tax system, which 
was amended in January 2016. Under previous rules, FCX’s 
share of income from Chilean operations was subject to an 
effective 35 percent tax rate allocated between income taxes 
and dividend withholding taxes. Under the amended tax 
reform package, FCX’s Chilean operation is subject to the 
“Partially-Integrated System,” resulting in FCX’s share of 
income from El Abra being subject to progressively 
increasing effective tax rates of 35 percent through 2019  
and 44.5 percent in 2020 and thereafter. In November 2017, 
the progression of increasing tax rates was delayed by  
the Chilean legislature so that the 35 percent rate continues 
through 2021 increasing to 44.5 percent in 2022 and thereafter.

In 2010, the Chilean legislature approved an increase in 

mining royalty taxes to help fund earthquake reconstruction 
activities, education and health programs. Mining royalty 
taxes at FCX’s El Abra mine were 4 percent for the years 2013 
through 2017. Beginning in 2018 and through 2023, rates 
move to a sliding scale of 5 to 14 percent (depending on a 
defined operational margin). 

tax positions using a threshold and measurement criteria  
for the financial statement recognition and measurement of 
a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. 
FCX’s policy associated with uncertain tax positions is  
to record accrued interest in interest expense and accrued 
penalties in other income and expense rather than in the 
provision for income taxes. A summary of the activities 
associated with FCX’s reserve for unrecognized tax benefits

The total amount of accrued interest and penalties 
associated with unrecognized tax benefits included in the 
consolidated balance sheets was $22 million at December 31, 
2017, $19 million at December 31, 2016, and $16 million at 
December 31, 2015. 

The reserve for unrecognized tax benefits of $390 million 

at December 31, 2017, included $344 million ($272 million  
net of income tax benefits and valuation allowances) that, if 
recognized, would reduce FCX’s provision for income  
taxes. Changes to the reserve for unrecognized tax benefits 
associated with current year tax positions were primarily 
related to uncertainties associated with FCX’s tax treatment 
of social welfare payments. Changes in the reserve for 
unrecognized tax benefits associated with prior year tax 
positions were primarily related to uncertainties associated 
with royalties and other related mining taxes and AMT  
credit refunds. Changes to the reserve for unrecognized  
tax benefits associated with the lapse of statute of  
limitations were primarily related to social welfare payments. 
There continues to be uncertainty related to the timing  
of settlements with taxing authorities, but if additional 
settlements  are  agreed  upon  during  2018,  FCX   
could experience a change in its reserve for unrecognized 
tax benefits.

NOTE 12. CONTINGENCIES

Environmental. FCX subsidiaries are subject to various 
national, state and local environmental laws and regulations 
that govern emissions of air pollutants; discharges of water 
pollutants; generation, handling, storage and disposal  
of hazardous substances, hazardous wastes and other toxic 
materials; and remediation, restoration and reclamation of 
environmental contamination. FCX subsidiaries that operate 
in the U.S. also are subject to potential liabilities arising under 
CERCLA and similar state laws that impose responsibility  
on current and previous owners and operators of a facility for 
the remediation of hazardous substances released from the 
facility into the environment, including damages to natural 
resources, in some cases irrespective of when the damage to 
the environment occurred or who caused it. Remediation 
liability also extends to persons who arranged for the 
disposal of hazardous substances or transported the hazardous 
substances to a disposal site selected by the transporter. 
These liabilities are often shared on a joint and several basis, 
meaning that each responsible party is fully responsible for 
the remediation, if some or all of the other historical owners 
or operators no longer exist, do not have the financial  
ability to respond or cannot be found. As a result, because of 
FCX’s acquisition of FMC in 2007, many of the subsidiary 
companies FCX now owns are responsible for a wide variety 
of environmental remediation projects throughout the U.S., 
and FCX expects to spend substantial sums annually for 
many years to address those remediation issues. Certain FCX 
subsidiaries have been advised by the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of the Interior, the 
Department of Agriculture and various state agencies that, 
under CERCLA or similar state laws and regulations, they 
may be liable for costs of responding to environmental 
conditions at a number of sites that have been or are being 
investigated to determine whether releases of hazardous 
substances have occurred and, if so, to develop and implement 
remedial actions to address environmental concerns. FCX is 
also subject to claims where the release of hazardous 

98

Freeport-McMoRan

substances is alleged to have damaged natural resources 
(NRD) and to litigation by individuals allegedly exposed  
to hazardous substances. As of December 31, 2017, FCX had 
more than 100 active remediation projects, including NRD 
claims, in 26 U.S. states.

a.  Represents accretion of the fair value of environmental obligations assumed in the 2007 acquisition 

of FMC, which were determined on a discounted cash flow basis.

b.  Reductions primarily reflect revisions for changes in the anticipated scope and timing of projects 

and other noncash adjustments.

Estimated future environmental cash payments (on an 
undiscounted and unescalated basis) total $134 million in 
2018, $132 million in 2019, $117 million in 2020, $119 million in 
2021, $88 million in 2022 and $2.7 billion thereafter. The 
amount and timing of these estimated payments will change 
as a result of changes in regulatory requirements, changes  
in scope and timing of remediation activities, the settlement 
of environmental matters and as actual spending occurs.

At December 31, 2017, FCX’s environmental obligations 

totaled $1.4 billion, including $1.3 billion recorded on a 
discounted basis for those obligations assumed in the FMC 
acquisition at fair value. On an undiscounted and unescalated 
basis, these obligations totaled $3.3 billion. FCX estimates it 
is reasonably possible that these obligations could range 
between $2.8 billion and $3.7 billion on an undiscounted and 
unescalated basis.

At December 31, 2017, the most significant environmental 

obligations were associated with the Pinal Creek site in 
Arizona; the Newtown Creek site in New York City; historical 
smelter sites principally located in Arizona, Indiana, Kansas, 
Missouri, New Jersey, Oklahoma and Pennsylvania; and 
uranium mining sites in the western U.S. The recorded 
environmental obligations for these sites totaled $1.3 billion 
at December 31, 2017. FCX may also be subject to litigation 
brought by private parties, regulators and local governmental 
authorities related to these historical sites. A discussion of 
these sites follows.

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Pinal Creek. The Pinal Creek site was listed under the 
Arizona Department of Environmental Quality’s (ADEQ) 
Water Quality Assurance Revolving Fund program in 1989 
for contamination in the shallow alluvial aquifers within the 
Pinal Creek drainage near Miami, Arizona. Since that time, 
environmental remediation was performed by members  
of the Pinal Creek Group, consisting of FM Miami, Inc. 
(Miami), a wholly owned subsidiary of FCX, and two other 
companies. Pursuant to a 2010 settlement agreement,  
Miami agreed to take full responsibility for future groundwater 
remediation at the Pinal Creek site, with limited exceptions. 
Remediation work mainly consisting of groundwater extraction 
and treatment continues and is expected to continue for 
many years in the future.

Newtown Creek. From the 1930s until 1964, Phelps Dodge 

Refining Corporation (PDRC), a subsidiary of FCX, operated a 
copper smelter, and from the 1930s until 1984 operated a 
copper refinery, on the banks of Newtown Creek (the creek), 
which is a 3.5-mile-long waterway that forms part of the 
boundary between Brooklyn and Queens in New York City. 
Heavy industrialization along the banks of the creek and 
discharges from the City of New York’s sewer system over 
more than a century resulted in significant environmental 
contamination of the waterway. In 2010, EPA notified PDRC, 
four other companies and the City of New York that EPA 
considers them to be PRPs under CERCLA. The notified 
parties began working with EPA to identify other PRPs, and 
EPA proposed that the notified parties perform a remedial 
investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS) at their expense and 
reimburse EPA for its oversight costs. EPA is not expected  
to propose a remedy until after the RI/FS is completed. 
Additionally, in 2010, EPA designated the creek as a Superfund 
site, and in 2011, PDRC and five other parties entered  
an Administrative Order on Consent (AOC) to perform the 
RI/FS to assess the nature and extent of environmental 
contamination in the creek and identify potential remedial 
options. The parties’ RI/FS work under the AOC and their 
efforts to identify other PRPs are ongoing. EPA recently 
identified eight additional parties as PRPs for the creek. The 
draft RI was submitted to EPA in November 2016, and the 
draft FS is expected to be submitted to EPA by the end  
of 2020. EPA’s remedial decision could be made in 2021 and 
remedial design could begin in 2022, with the actual 
remediation construction starting several years later. The 
actual costs of fulfilling this remedial obligation and the 
allocation of costs among PRPs are uncertain and subject to 
change based on the results of the RI/FS, the remediation 
remedy ultimately selected by EPA and related allocation 
determinations. The overall cost and the portion ultimately 

allocated to PDRC could be material to FCX. During 2017,  
FCX recorded charges of $138 million for revised cost estimates  
for the Newtown Creek environmental obligation.

Historical Smelter Sites. FCX subsidiaries and their 

predecessors at various times owned or operated copper, 
zinc and lead smelters or refineries in states including 
Arizona, Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, New Jersey, Oklahoma 
and Pennsylvania. For some of these former processing  
sites, certain FCX subsidiaries have been advised by EPA  
or state agencies that they may be liable for costs of 
investigating and, if appropriate, remediating environmental 
conditions associated with these former processing facilities. 
At other sites, certain FCX subsidiaries have entered into 
state voluntary remediation programs to investigate and, if 
appropriate, remediate onsite and offsite conditions 
associated with the facilities. The historical processing sites 
are in various stages of assessment and remediation. At some 
of these sites, disputes with local residents and elected 
officials regarding alleged health effects or the effectiveness 
of remediation efforts have resulted in litigation of various 
types, and similar litigation at other sites is possible.

From 1920 until 1986, United States Metal Refining Company 

(USMR), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Cyprus 
Amax Minerals Company, owned and operated a copper 
smelter and refinery in the Borough of Carteret, New Jersey. 
Since the early 1980s, the site has been the subject of 
environmental investigation and remediation, primarily under 
the supervision of the New Jersey Department of 
Environmental Protection. On January 30, 2017, a class action 
titled Juan Duarte, Betsy Duarte and N.D., Infant, by Parents 
and Natural Guardians Juan Duarte and Betsy Duarte,  
Leroy Nobles and Betty Nobles, on behalf of themselves and 
all others similarly situated v. United States Metals Refining 
Company, Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. and Amax 
Realty Development, Inc., Docket No. 734-17, was filed in  
the Superior Court of New Jersey against USMR, FCX, and 
Amax Realty Development, Inc. The defendants have 
removed this litigation to the U.S. District Court for the 
District of New Jersey, where it remains pending. Pursuant 
to an amendment of the complaint in December of 2017,  
FCX is no longer a party to the lawsuit and FMC has been 
added to the lawsuit. The suit alleges that USMR generated 
and disposed of smelter waste at the site and allegedly 
released contaminants onsite and offsite through discharges 
to surface water and air emissions over a period of decades 
and seeks unspecified damages for economic losses, 
including loss of property value, medical monitoring, punitive 
damages and other damages. FCX intends to vigorously 
defend this matter.

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

As a result of recent off-site soil sampling in public and 

AROs. FCX’s ARO estimates are reflected on a third-party 

private areas near the former Carteret smelter, FCX increased 
its associated environmental obligation for known and 
potential off-site environmental remediation by recording a 
$59 million charge to operating income in 2017. Additional 
sampling is ongoing and could result in additional adjustments 
to the related environmental remediation obligation.

Uranium Mining Sites. During a period between 1940  

and the early 1970s, certain FCX subsidiaries and their 
predecessors were involved in uranium exploration and 
mining in the western U.S., primarily on federal and tribal 
lands in the Four Corners region of the southwest.  
Similar exploration and mining activities by other companies 
have also caused environmental impacts warranting 
remediation. In January 2017, the Department of Justice, 
EPA, Navajo Nation and two FCX-related subsidiaries 
reached an agreement regarding the financial contribution of 
the U.S. Government and the FCX subsidiaries and the 
scope of the environmental investigation and remediation 
work for the cleanup of 94 former uranium mining sites  
on tribal lands. The settlement terms are outlined in a Consent 
Decree that was filed on January 17, 2017, in the U.S. District 
Court for the District of Arizona. Under the Consent Decree, 
which the government valued at over $600 million, FCX 
subsidiaries are in the process of performing the 
environmental investigation and remediation work at 94 sites, 
and the United States contributed $335 million into a trust 
fund to cover the government’s initial share of the costs. The 
program is expected to take more than 20 years to complete. 
Based on updated cash flow and timing estimates, FCX 
reduced its associated obligation for that contingency by 
recording a $41 million credit to operating income in second-
quarter 2017 after receiving court approval of the Consent 
Decree. In addition to uranium activities on tribal lands, FCX 
is conducting site surveys of historical uranium mining  
claims associated with FCX subsidiaries on non-tribal federal 
lands in the Four Corners region. Under a memorandum  
of understanding with the U.S. Bureau of Land Management 
(BLM), site surveys are being performed on over 5,000 
mining claims, ranging from undisturbed claims to claims 
with mining features. Based on these surveys, BLM may 
provide no further action determinations for undisturbed 
claims or requests for additional assessment or closure 
activities for others.

a.  Revisions to cash flow estimates were primarily related to revised estimates for an overburden 

stockpile in Indonesia and at certain oil and gas properties.
b.  Primarily reflects the sale of certain oil and gas properties.

ARO costs may increase or decrease significantly in the 
future as a result of changes in regulations, changes in 
engineering designs and technology, permit modifications  
or updates, changes in mine plans, settlements, inflation  
or other factors and as reclamation spending occurs. ARO 
activities and expenditures for mining operations generally 
are made over an extended period of time commencing  
near the end of the mine life; however, certain reclamation 
activities may be accelerated if legally required or if 
determined to be economically beneficial. The methods used 
or required to plug and abandon non-producing oil and gas 
wellbores; remove platforms, tanks, production equipment 
and flow lines; and restore wellsites could change over time.

Financial Assurance. New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado and 
other states, as well as federal regulations governing mine 
operations on federal land, require financial assurance to be 
provided for the estimated costs of mine reclamation and 
closure, including groundwater quality protection programs. 
FCX has satisfied financial assurance requirements by  
using a variety of mechanisms, primarily involving parent 
company performance guarantees and financial capability 
demonstrations, but also including trust funds, surety  
bonds, letters of credit and other collateral. The applicable 
regulations specify financial strength tests that are designed 
to confirm a company’s or guarantor’s financial capability  
to fund estimated reclamation and closure costs. The amount 
of financial assurance FCX is required to provide will vary 
with changes in laws, regulations, reclamation and closure 
requirements, and cost estimates. At December 31, 2017, 
FCX’s financial assurance obligations associated with these

Freeport-McMoRan

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

U.S. mine closure and reclamation/restoration costs  
totaled $1.2 billion, of which $703 million was in the form of 
guarantees issued by FCX and FMC. At December 31, 2017, 
FCX had trust assets totaling $180 million (included in other 
assets), which are legally restricted to be used to satisfy  
its financial assurance obligations for its mining properties 
in New Mexico. In addition, FCX has financial assurance 
obligations for its oil and gas properties associated with 
plugging and abandoning wells and facilities totaling  
$614 million. Where oil and gas guarantees associated with 
the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management do not include  
a stated cap, the amounts reflect management’s estimates of 
the potential exposure. 

New Mexico Environmental and Reclamation Programs. FCX’s 
New Mexico operations are regulated under the New Mexico 
Water Quality Act and regulations adopted by the Water 
Quality Control Commission (WQCC). In connection with 
discharge permits, the New Mexico Environment Department 
(NMED) has required each of these operations to submit 
closure plans for NMED’s approval. The closure plans must 
include measures to assure meeting applicable groundwater 
quality standards following the closure of discharging 
facilities and to abate groundwater or surface water 
contamination to meet applicable standards. In 2013, the 
WQCC adopted Supplemental Permitting Requirements  
for Copper Mining Facilities, which became effective on 
December 1, 2013, and specify closure requirements for copper 
mine facilities. The rules were adopted after an extensive 
stakeholder process in which FCX participated and were jointly 
supported by FCX and NMED. The rules are currently being 
challenged in the New Mexico Supreme Court by certain 
environmental organizations and the New Mexico Attorney 
General. Finalized closure plan requirements, including those 
resulting from application of the 2013 rules or the application 
of different standards if the rules are invalidated by the  
New Mexico Supreme Court, could result in material increases 
in closure costs for FCX’s New Mexico operations.

FCX’s New Mexico operations also are subject to regulation 

under the 1993 New Mexico Mining Act (the Mining Act) and 
the related rules that are administered by the Mining and 
Minerals Division (MMD) of the New Mexico Energy, Minerals 
and Natural Resources Department. Under the Mining Act, 
mines are required to obtain approval of plans describing  
the reclamation to be performed following cessation of 
mining operations. At December 31, 2017, FCX had accrued 
reclamation and closure costs of $453 million for its  
New Mexico operations. As stated above, additional accruals 

may be required based on the state’s periodic review of FCX’s 
updated closure plans and any resulting permit conditions, 
and the amount of those accruals could be material.

Arizona Environmental and Reclamation Programs. FCX’s 
Arizona properties are subject to regulatory oversight in 
several areas. ADEQ has adopted regulations for its aquifer 
protection permit (APP) program that require permits for, 
among other things, certain facilities, activities and structures 
used for mining, leaching, concentrating and smelting, and 
require compliance with aquifer water quality standards at 
an applicable point of compliance well or location during 
both operations and closure. The APP program also may 
require mitigation and discharge reduction or elimination of 
some discharges.

An application for an APP requires a proposed closure 

strategy that will meet applicable groundwater protection 
requirements following cessation of operations and an 
estimate of the cost to implement the closure strategy. An 
APP may specify closure requirements, which may include 
post-closure monitoring and maintenance. A more detailed 
closure plan must be submitted within 90 days after a 
permitted entity notifies ADEQ of its intent to cease operations. 
A permit applicant must demonstrate its financial ability to 
meet the closure costs approved by ADEQ. In 2014, the state 
enacted legislation requiring closure costs for facilities 
covered by APPs to be updated no more frequently than 
every five years and financial assurance mechanisms to be 
updated no more frequently than every two years. While 
some closure cost updates have occurred in the normal 
course as modifications to APPs, ADEQ has not yet formally 
notified FCX regarding the timetable for updating other 
closure cost estimates and financial assurance mechanisms 
for FCX’s Arizona mine sites. In 2016, ADEQ approved a 
closure plan update for Sierrita, which resulted in increased 
closure costs. FCX may be required to begin updating its 
closure cost estimates at other Arizona sites in 2018.

Portions of Arizona mining facilities that operated after 

January 1, 1986, also are subject to the Arizona Mined Land 
Reclamation Act (AMLRA). AMLRA requires reclamation to 
achieve stability and safety consistent with post-mining land 
use objectives specified in a reclamation plan. Reclamation 
plans must be approved by the State Mine Inspector and must 
include an estimate of the cost to perform the reclamation 
measures specified in the plan along with financial assurance. 
During 2016, Safford submitted an update to its reclamation 
plan, which increased its reclamation costs. FCX will continue 
to evaluate options for future reclamation and closure 
activities at its operating and non-operating sites, which are 
likely to result in adjustments to FCX’s ARO liabilities, and 

2017 Annual Report

those adjustments could be material. At December 31, 2017, 
FCX had accrued reclamation and closure costs of $346 million 
for its Arizona operations.

Colorado Reclamation Programs. FCX’s Colorado operations 
are regulated by the Colorado Mined Land Reclamation Act 
(Reclamation Act) and regulations promulgated thereunder. 
Under the Reclamation Act, mines are required to obtain 
approval of plans for reclamation of lands affected by mining 
operations to be performed during mining or upon cessation 
of mining operations. During 2016, at the request of the 
Colorado Division of Reclamation Mining & Safety, the Climax 
mine submitted a revised cost estimate for its current 
reclamation plan, which did not materially change the 
closure plan cost. As of December 31, 2017, FCX had accrued 
reclamation and closure costs of $56 million for its 
Colorado operations. 

Chilean Reclamation and Closure Programs. In July 2011,  

the Chilean senate passed legislation regulating mine closure, 
which established new requirements for closure plans.  
FCX’s El Abra operation submitted updated closure cost 
estimates based on the existing approved closure plan in 
November 2014, which were approved in August 2015.  
At December 31, 2017, FCX had accrued reclamation and 
closure costs of $58 million for its El Abra operation. 

Peruvian Reclamation and Closure Programs. Cerro Verde  

is subject to regulation under the Mine Closure Law 
administered by the Peruvian Ministry of Energy and Mines. 
Under the closure regulations, mines must submit a closure 
plan that includes the reclamation methods, closure cost 
estimates, methods of control and verification, closure and 
post-closure plans, and financial assurance. The latest closure 
plan and cost estimate for the Cerro Verde mine expansion 
were submitted to the Peruvian regulatory authorities in 
November 2013 and approved in August 2014. At December 
31, 2017, Cerro Verde had accrued reclamation and closure 
costs of $108 million.

Indonesian Reclamation and Closure Programs. The ultimate 

amount of reclamation and closure costs to be incurred at 
PT-FI’s operations will be determined based on applicable 
laws and regulations and PT-FI’s assessment of appropriate 
remedial activities in the circumstances, after consultation 
with governmental authorities, affected local residents and 
other affected parties and cannot currently be projected with 
precision. Some reclamation costs will be incurred during 
mining activities, while the remaining reclamation costs will 
be incurred at the end of mining activities, which are 
currently estimated to continue for approximately 24 years. 
At the end of 2016, PT-FI revised its estimates for an 

overburden stockpile to address ongoing erosion that 
occurred during 2016, a design change that increased the 
volume and updated cost estimates reflecting more recent 
productivity and costs at the overburden stockpile, which 
resulted in an increase in the ARO of $372 million. At 
December 31, 2017, PT-FI had accrued reclamation and 
closure costs of $977 million.

In December 2009, PT-FI submitted its revised mine 
closure plan to the Department of Energy and Mineral 
Resources for review and addressed comments received 
during the course of this review process. In December 2010, 
the Indonesian government issued a regulation regarding 
mine reclamation and closure, which requires a company to 
provide a mine closure guarantee in the form of a time 
deposit placed in a state-owned bank in Indonesia. In 
accordance with its COW, PT-FI continues to work with the 
Department of Energy and Mineral Resources to review the 
application of these requirements, including discussion of 
other options for satisfaction of the mine closure guarantee. 
During 2017, PT-FI funded $22 million into a restricted time 
deposit account for mine closure guarantees and $7 million 
for reclamation guarantees.

In October 2017, Indonesia’s Ministry of Environment and 

Forestry (the Ministry) notified PT-FI of administrative 
sanctions related to certain activities the Ministry indicated 
are not reflected in its environmental permit. The Ministry 
also notified PT-FI that certain operational activities were 
inconsistent with factors set forth in its environmental 
permitting studies and that additional monitoring and 
improvements need to be undertaken related to air quality, 
water drainage, treatment and handling of certain wastes, 
and tailings management. PT-FI has been engaged in  
a process to update its permits through submissions and 
dialogue with the Ministry, which began in late 2014. PT-FI 
believes that it has submitted the required documentation to 
update its permits and is in the process of addressing other 
points raised by the Ministry.

Oil and Gas Properties. Substantially all of FM O&G’s oil and 

gas leases require that, upon termination of economic 
production, the working interest owners plug and abandon 
non-producing wellbores, remove equipment and facilities 
from leased acreage, and restore land in accordance with 
applicable local, state and federal laws. Following several sales 
transactions in 2016 and 2017, FM O&G’s remaining operating 
areas include the GOM shelf, offshore California, the Gulf 
Coast and the Rocky Mountain area as of December 31, 2017. 
FM O&G AROs cover approximately 250 wells and  
140 platforms and other structures. At December 31, 2017,  
FM O&G had accrued $553 million associated with its AROs.

discussed in this note under “Environmental.” FCX is also 
involved periodically in reviews, inquiries, investigations and 
other proceedings initiated by or involving government 
agencies, some of which may result in adverse judgments, 
settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief. 
Management does not believe, based on currently available 
information, that the outcome of any legal proceeding will 
have a material adverse effect on FCX’s financial condition, 
although individual outcomes could be material to FCX’s 
operating results for a particular period, depending on the 
nature and magnitude of the outcome and the operating 
results for the period.

Asbestos Claims. Since approximately 1990, FMC and 
various subsidiaries have been named as defendants in  
a large number of lawsuits that claim personal injury either 
from exposure to asbestos allegedly contained in electrical 
wire products produced or marketed many years ago or  
from asbestos contained in buildings and facilities located at 
properties owned or operated by FMC affiliates, or from 
alleged asbestos in talc products. Many of these suits involve 
a large number of codefendants. Based on litigation results  
to date and facts currently known, FCX believes there is  
a reasonable possibility that losses may have been incurred 
related to these matters; however, FCX also believes that the 
amounts of any such losses, individually or in the aggregate, 
are not material to its consolidated financial statements. 
There can be no assurance, however, that future developments 
will not alter this conclusion.

tax authority, has assessed mining royalties on ore processed 
by the Cerro Verde concentrator, which commenced 
operations in late 2006, for the period December 2006 to 
December 2011. Cerro Verde contested these assessments 
because it believes that its 1998 stability agreement 
exempts from royalties all minerals extracted from its mining 
concession, irrespective of the method used for processing 
those minerals. No assessments have been issued for the 
period from January 2012 through December 2013, and no 
assessments can be issued for years after 2013, as Cerro Verde 
began paying royalties on all of its production in January 2014 
under its new 15-year stability agreement. Since 2014,  
Cerro Verde has been paying the disputed assessments for 
the period from December 2006 through December 2008 
under an installment program ($142 million paid by Cerro Verde 
through December 31, 2017).

In October 2017, the Peruvian Supreme Court issued a 

ruling in favor of SUNAT that the assessments of royalties 
for the year 2008 on ore processed by the Cerro Verde 
concentrator were proper under Peruvian law.

As a result of the unfavorable Peruvian Supreme Court 

ruling on the 2008 royalty dispute, Cerro Verde recorded 
pre-tax charges totaling $348 million ($355 million  
including net tax charges and $186 million net of noncontrolling 
interests) in 2017, consisting of $244 million in royalty 
assessments, $151 million of penalties and interest related to 
the December 2006 to December 2008 assessments, and 
$89 million for related items (primarily associated with the 
special mining tax and net assets tax) that Cerro Verde 
would have incurred under the view that its concentrator was 
not stabilized.

while others are defined by general tax laws and regulations. 
FCX and its subsidiaries are subject to reviews of its income 
tax filings and other tax payments, and disputes can arise 
with the taxing authorities over the interpretation of its 
contracts or laws. The final taxes paid may be dependent 
upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing 
authorities. In certain jurisdictions, FCX must pay a portion of 
the disputed amount to the local government in order to 
formally appeal the assessment. Such payment is recorded as 
a receivable if FCX believes the amount is collectible.

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Cerro Verde acted in good faith in applying the provisions of 
its 1998 stability agreement and continues to evaluate 
alternatives to defend its rights. Cerro Verde intends to seek 
a waiver available under Peruvian law of penalties and 
interest associated with this matter and has not recorded 
charges for potential penalties and interest totaling  
$385 million ($206 million net of noncontrolling interests) at 
December 31, 2017, as FCX believes that Cerro Verde can 
obtain a waiver under Peruvian law and a loss is not probable. 
Cerro Verde also intends to file a reimbursement claim with 
SUNAT for penalties and interest paid under the installment 
plan for the December 2006 to December 2008 assessments, 
and may have claims for reimbursement of payments 
it would not have made in the absence of the stabilization 
agreement, such as the overpayments made for a special 
(voluntary) levy (GEM), import duties and civil association 
contributions. No amounts have been recorded for these 
potential gain contingencies at December 31, 2017.

Other Peruvian Tax Matters. Cerro Verde has also received 

assessments from SUNAT for additional taxes, penalties and 
interest related to various audit exceptions for income and 
other taxes. Cerro Verde has filed or will file objections to the 
assessments because it believes it has properly determined 
and paid its taxes. A summary of these assessments follows:

from the Indonesian tax authorities for additional taxes  
and interest related to various audit exceptions for income  
and other taxes. PT-FI has filed objections to the 
assessments because it believes it has properly determined

and paid its taxes. Excluding surface water and withholding 
tax assessments discussed below and the Indonesian 
government’s imposition of a 7.5 percent export duty (refer 
to Note 13), a summary of these assessments follows:

As of December 31, 2017, PT-FI had paid $417 million 
(included in other assets) on disputed tax assessments, which 
it believes is collectible.

In December 2009, PT-FI was notified by Indonesian  

tax authorities that it was obligated to pay value-added taxes 
on certain goods imported after the year 2000. In 
December 2014, PT-FI paid $269 million for value-added 
taxes for the period from November 2005 through the year 
2009 and sought a refund. In March 2016, PT-FI collected  
a cash refund of $196 million and $38 million was offset 
against other tax liabilities. The remaining balance of the 
amount originally paid was reduced by currency exchange 
and other losses.

PT-FI received assessments from the local regional tax 

authority in Papua, Indonesia, for additional taxes and 
penalties related to surface water taxes for the period from 
January 2011 through December 2017. PT-FI has filed or will 
file appeals with the Indonesia Tax Court. During 2017, the 
Indonesia Tax Court issued rulings against PT-FI with respect 
to assessments for additional taxes and penalties for the 
period from January 2011 through December 2015 in the 
amount of $400 million (based on the exchange rate as of 
December 31, 2017, and including $239 million in penalties). 
The aggregate amount of assessments received from 
January 2016 through December 2017 was an additional $130 
million (based on the exchange rate as of December 31, 2017, 
and including $65 million in penalties). No charges have been 
recorded for these assessments as of December 31, 2017, 
because PT-FI believes its COW exempts it from these 
payments and that it has the right to contest these 
assessments in the Indonesia Tax Court and ultimately the 
Indonesia Supreme Court. FCX estimates the total exposure 
based on the exchange rate as of December 31, 2017, totals 
$530 million, including penalties. As of February 20, 2018, 

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

PT-FI has not paid and does not intend to pay these 
assessments unless there is a mechanism established to 
secure a refund for any such payments upon the final court 
decision. Additionally, PT-FI is seeking to address this matter 
in connection with the ongoing negotiations with the 
Indonesian government to resolve PT-FI’s long-term mining 
rights. If the local regional tax authority were to force PT-FI  
to make these payments through the threat of expropriation 
of assets or other measures, such amounts may not be 
recoverable from the local regional tax authority and may 
result in a charge to operating income. At this time, PT-FI 
does not believe that the threat of seizure of PT-FI assets  
is imminent. 

In November 2017, PT-FI received an Indonesia Supreme 
Court decision that overturned a Tax Court case previously 
decided in favor of PT-FI related to 2005 assessments of less 
than $1 million for employee withholding taxes. PT-FI has 
other pending cases at the Indonesia Supreme Court related 
to withholding taxes for employees and other service 
providers for the year 2005 and the year 2007, which total 
approximately $66 million (based on the December 31, 2017, 
exchange rate), including penalties and interest. PT-FI 
believes the ruling in the case regarding the 2005 assessments 
is inconsistent with a ruling by the Indonesia Supreme Court  
in a similar case and is also inconsistent with PT-FI’s COW. 
PT-FI plans to continue to defend the outstanding cases and 
has not recorded charges for those cases because it does  
not believe a loss is probable. Because of a 2013 Ministry of 
Finance ruling that definitively defines withholding tax rates 
for employees and other service providers, and the statute of 
limitations, PT-FI does not believe it has exposure in any 
years after 2007.

Letters of Credit, Bank Guarantees and Surety Bonds. 

Letters of credit and bank guarantees totaled $283 million at 
December 31, 2017, primarily for environmental and asset 
retirement obligations, the Cerro Verde royalty dispute (refer 
to discussion above), workers’ compensation insurance 
programs, tax and customs obligations, and other commercial 
obligations. In addition, FCX had surety bonds totaling  
$326 million at December 31, 2017, primarily associated with 
environmental and asset retirement obligations.

Insurance. FCX purchases a variety of insurance  

products to mitigate potential losses, which typically have 
specified deductible amounts or self-insured retentions 
and policy limits. FCX generally is self-insured for U.S. 
workers’ compensation, but purchases excess insurance up 
to statutory limits. An actuarial analysis is performed twice  

a year on the various casualty insurance programs covering 
FCX’s U.S.-based mining operations, including workers’ 
compensation, to estimate expected losses. At December 31, 
2017, FCX’s liability for expected losses under these insurance 
programs totaled $57 million, which consisted of a current 
portion of $10 million (included in accounts payable and 
accrued liabilities) and a long-term portion of $47 million 
(included in other liabilities). In addition, FCX has receivables 
of $16 million (a current portion of $2 million included in other 
accounts receivable and a long-term portion of $14 million 
included in other assets) for expected claims associated with 
these losses to be filed with insurance carriers.

FCX’s oil and gas operations are subject to all of the risks 

normally incident to the production of oil and gas, including 
well blowouts, cratering, explosions, oil spills, releases of  
gas or well fluids, fires, pollution and releases of toxic gas, 
each of which could result in damage to or destruction of oil 
and gas wells, production facilities or other property, or 
injury to persons. While FCX is not fully insured against all 
risks related to its oil and gas operations, its insurance policies 
provide limited coverage for losses or liabilities relating to 
pollution, with broader coverage for sudden and accidental 
occurrences. FCX is self-insured for named windstorms in  
the GOM.

NOTE 13. COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES

Operating Leases. FCX leases various types of properties, 
including offices and equipment. Future minimum rentals 
under non-cancelable leases at December 31, 2017 (excluding 
amounts related to assets held for sale), total $34 million  
in 2018, $24 million in 2019, $20 million in 2020, $18 million in 
2021, $17 million in 2022 and $95 million thereafter. Minimum 
payments under operating leases have not been reduced by 
aggregate minimum sublease rentals, which are minimal. 
Total aggregate rental expense under operating leases was 
$59 million in 2017 and $71 million in both 2016 and 2015.

Contractual Obligations. Based on applicable prices at 

December 31, 2017, FCX has unconditional purchase obligations 
of $3.4 billion, primarily comprising the procurement of 
copper concentrate ($2.4 billion), electricity ($0.4 billion) and 
transportation services ($0.3 billion). Some of FCX’s 
unconditional purchase obligations are settled based on the 
prevailing market rate for the service or commodity 
purchased. In some cases, the amount of the actual obligation 
may change over time because of market conditions. 
Obligations for copper concentrate provide for deliveries of 
specified volumes to Atlantic Copper at market-based 
prices. Electricity obligations are primarily for long-term 

2017 Annual Report

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

power purchase agreements in North America and 
contractual minimum demand at the South America mines. 
Transportation obligations are primarily for South America 
contracted ocean freight. Amounts exclude approximately 
$0.8 billion in total contractual obligations related to assets 
held for sale, which is primarily for the procurement of 
cobalt. Obligations for cobalt provide for deliveries of 
specified volumes to Freeport Cobalt (an asset held for sale) 
at market-based prices.

FCX’s unconditional purchase obligations by year total 

$2.4 billion in 2018, $537 million in 2019, $91 million in 2020, 
$92 million in 2021, $35 million in 2022 and $270 million 
thereafter. During the three-year period ended December 31, 
2017, FCX fulfilled its minimum contractual purchase 
obligations.

Mining Contracts — Indonesia. FCX is entitled to mine in 

Indonesia under the COW between PT-FI and the Indonesian 
government. The original COW was entered into in 1967  
and was replaced with the current COW in 1991. The initial 
term of the current COW expires in 2021 but can be extended 
by PT-FI for two 10-year periods subject to Indonesian 
government approval, which pursuant to the COW cannot  
be withheld or delayed unreasonably.

The copper royalty rate payable by PT-FI under its COW, 

prior to modifications discussed below as a result of the  
July 2014 Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), varied 
from 1.5 percent of copper net revenue at a copper price of 
$0.90 or less per pound to 3.5 percent at a copper price  
of $1.10 or more per pound. The COW royalty rate for gold 
and silver sales was at a fixed rate of 1.0 percent.

A large part of the mineral royalties under Indonesian 

government regulations is designated to the provinces from 
which the minerals are extracted. In connection with its 
fourth concentrator mill expansion completed in 1998, PT-FI 
agreed to pay the Indonesian government additional royalties 
(royalties not required by the COW) to provide further 
support to the local governments and to the people of the 
Indonesian province of Papua. The additional royalties were 
paid on production exceeding specified annual amounts  
of copper, gold and silver generated when PT-FI’s milling 
facilities operated above 200,000 metric tons of ore per day. 
The additional royalty for copper equaled the COW royalty 
rate, and for gold and silver equaled twice the COW royalty 
rates. Therefore, PT-FI’s royalty rate on copper net revenues 
from production above the agreed levels was double the 
COW royalty rate, and the royalty rates on gold and silver sales 
from production above the agreed levels were triple the  
COW royalty rates. 

In January 2014, the Indonesian government published 
regulations pursuant to the 2009 mining law that, among 
other things, imposed a progressive export duty on copper 
concentrate and restricted exports of copper concentrate 
and anode slimes (a by-product of the refining process 
containing metals, including gold) after January 12, 2017. 
PT-FI’s COW authorizes it to export concentrate and specifies 
the taxes and other fiscal terms available to its operations. 
The COW states that PT-FI shall not be subject to taxes, 
duties or fees subsequently imposed or approved by the 
Indonesian government except as expressly provided in the 
COW. Additionally, PT-FI complied with the requirements  
of its COW for local processing by arranging for the 
construction and commissioning of Indonesia’s only copper 
smelter and refinery, which is owned by PT Smelting (refer  
to Note 6).

In July 2014, PT-FI entered into a MOU with the Indonesian 

government, under which PT-FI and the Indonesian 
government agreed to negotiate an amended COW to extend 
PT-FI’s operations beyond 2021 on acceptable terms. 
Subject to concluding an agreement to extend PT-FI’s 
operations, PT-FI agreed to: (i) construct new smelter 
capacity in Indonesia and provide a $115 million assurance 
bond to support its commitment; (ii) pay export duties until 
certain smelter development milestones were met (initially 
set at 7.5 percent, declining to 5.0 percent when smelter 
development progress exceeds 7.5 percent and eliminated 
when development progress exceeds 30 percent); (iii) divest 
an additional 20.64 percent interest in PT-FI at fair market 
value to Indonesian participants; (iv) increase the royalty 
paid on copper to 4.0 percent from 3.5 percent under the 
COW; and (v) increase the royalty paid on gold and silver  
to 3.75 percent from 1.0 percent under the COW. The MOU 
also anticipated an amendment of the COW within six months 
to address other matters. In January 2015, the MOU was 
extended to July 25, 2015, and ultimately expired on that date. 
Following the expiration of the MOU, the Indonesian 
government has continued to require the smelter bond, and 
to impose the increased royalty rates and export duties. 
PT-FI’s royalties totaled $173 million in 2017, $131 million in 
2016 and $114 million in 2015; its export duties totaled  
$115 million in 2017, $95 million in 2016 and $109 million  
in 2015.

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

In October 2015, the Indonesian government provided  

a letter of assurance to PT-FI indicating that it would revise 
regulations allowing it to approve the extension of PT-FI’s 
operations beyond 2021, and provide the same rights and the 
same level of legal and fiscal certainty provided under the 
current COW.

In January and February 2017, the Indonesian government 

issued new regulations pursuant to the 2009 mining law to 
address exports of unrefined metals, including copper 
concentrate and anode slimes, and other matters related to 
the mining sector. The new regulations permit the continuation 
of copper concentrate exports for a five-year period 
through January 2022, subject to various conditions, 
including conversion from a contract of work to a special 
mining license (known as an IUPK, which does not provide 
the same level of fiscal and legal protections as PT-FI’s COW, 
which remains in effect), a commitment to the completion  
of smelter construction in five years and payment of export 
duties to be determined by the Ministry of Finance. In 
addition, the new regulations enable application for an 
extension of mining rights five years before expiration of the 
IUPK and require foreign IUPK holders to divest a 51 percent 
interest to Indonesian interests no later than the tenth year of 
production. Export licenses would be valid for one-year 
periods, subject to review every six months, depending on 
smelter construction progress.

Following the issuance of the January and February 2017 

regulations and discussions with the Indonesian government, 
PT-FI advised the government that it was prepared to 
convert its COW to an IUPK, subject to extension of its long- 
term mining rights to 2041 and obtaining an investment 
stability agreement providing contractual rights with the 
same level of legal and fiscal certainty provided under its 
COW, and provided that the COW would remain in effect 
until it is replaced by a mutually satisfactory alternative. PT-FI 
also committed to commence construction of a new smelter 
during a five-year time frame after approval of the extension 
of its long-term mining rights.

On January 12, 2017, PT-FI suspended exports in response 

to Indonesian regulations in effect at the time. In addition,  
as a result of labor disturbances and a delay in the renewal 
of its export license for anode slimes, PT Smelting’s 
operations were shut down from mid-January 2017 until 
early March 2017. On February 10, 2017, PT-FI was forced  
to suspend production as a result of limited storage capacity 
at PT-FI and PT Smelting. On April 21, 2017, the Indonesian 

government issued a permit to PT-FI that allowed exports to 
resume for a six-month period, and PT-FI commenced 
export shipments.

In mid-February 2017, pursuant to the COW’s dispute 

resolution provisions, PT-FI provided formal notice to the 
Indonesian government of an impending dispute listing the 
government’s breaches and violations of the COW, including, 
but not limited to, the: (i) imposition of restrictions on 
PT-FI’s basic right to export mining products in violation of 
the COW; (ii) imposition of export duties other than those 
taxes and other charges expressly provided for in the COW; 
(iii) imposition of surface water taxes in excess of the 
restrictions imposed by the COW (refer to Note 12 for further 
discussion of these assessments); (iv) requirement for PT-FI 
to build a smelter, when no such requirement was in the 
COW; (v) unreasonably withholding and delaying the 
approval of the two successive ten-year extensions of the 
term of the COW; and (vi) imposition of divestment 
requirements not provided for in the COW. PT-FI continues to 
reserve its rights under these provisions.

As a result of the 2017 regulatory restrictions and 

uncertainties regarding long-term investment stability, PT-FI 
took actions to adjust its cost structure, slow investments  
in its underground development projects and new smelter, 
and place certain of its workforce on furlough programs.

In late March 2017, the Indonesian government amended 

the regulations to enable PT-FI to retain its COW until 
replaced with an IUPK accompanied by an investment 
stability agreement, and to grant PT-FI a temporary IUPK.  
In April 2017, PT-FI entered into a Memorandum of 
Understanding with the Indonesian government (the 2017 
MOU) confirming that the COW would continue to be  
valid and honored until replaced by a mutually agreed IUPK 
and investment stability agreement. In the 2017 MOU,  
PT-FI agreed to continue to pay a 5.0 percent export duty 
during this period. Subsequently, the Customs Office of  
the Minister of Finance refused to recognize the 5.0 percent 
export duty under the 2017 MOU and imposed a 7.5 percent 
export duty under the Ministry of Finance regulations,  
which PT-FI has paid under protest since resuming exports  
in April 2017. PT-FI is disputing the incremental 2.5 percent 
export duty while the matter is pending in Indonesia  
Tax Court proceedings, and amounts paid are being held

in a restricted cash account or in a long-term receivable 
($38 million total balance at December 31, 2017, of which 
$22 million was included in other current assets and  
$16 million in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets) 
that PT-FI expects to have released or refunded in full once 
the matter is resolved. 

In August 2017, FCX and the Indonesian government 

reached an understanding on a framework that would replace 
the COW while providing PT-FI with long-term mining rights. 
This framework includes (i) conversion from the COW to an 
IUPK providing PT-FI with long-term mining rights through 
2041; (ii) Indonesian government certainty of fiscal and legal 
terms during the term of the IUPK; (iii) PT-FI commitment  
to construct a new smelter in Indonesia within five years of 
reaching a definitive agreement; and (iv) divestment of  
51 percent of the project area interests to Indonesian 
participants at fair market value, structured so that FCX 
retains control over operations and governance of PT-FI. 
Execution of a definitive agreement will require approval by 
the Board and PT-FI’s joint venture partner, Rio Tinto, as well 
as the modification or revocation of current regulations  
and the implementation of new regulations by the Indonesian 
government. FCX cannot currently predict whether there  
will be any material accounting and tax impacts associated 
with the divestment.

In late 2017, the Indonesian government (including the 

regional government of Papua Province and Mimika Regency) 
and PT Indonesia Asahan Aluminium (Inalum), a state-owned 
enterprise, which will lead the government’s consortium  
of investors, agreed to form a special purpose company to 
acquire Grasberg project area interests. Inalum is wholly 
owned by the Indonesian government and currently holds 
9.36 percent of PT-FI’s outstanding common stock. FCX is 
engaged in discussions with Inalum and Rio Tinto regarding 
potential arrangements that would result in the Inalum 
consortium acquiring interests that would meet the 
Indonesian government’s 51 percent ownership objective in a 
manner satisfactory to all parties, and in a structure that 
would provide for continuity of FCX’s management of PT-FI’s 
operations and governance of the business. The parties 
continue to negotiate documentation on a comprehensive 
agreement for PT-FI’s extended operations and to reach 
agreement on timing, process and governance matters 

relating to the divestment. The parties have a mutual objective 
of completing negotiations and the required documentation 
during the first half of 2018.

In December 2017, PT-FI was granted an extension of its 

temporary IUPK through June 30, 2018, to enable exports to 
continue while negotiations on a definitive agreement 
proceed. In February 2018, PT-FI received an extension of its 
export license through February 15, 2019. On February 15, 
2018, PT Smelting submitted an application to renew its 
anode slimes export license, which expires March 1, 2018.

Until a definitive agreement is reached, PT-FI has reserved 

all rights under its COW, including dispute resolution 
procedures. FCX cannot predict whether PT-FI will be 
successful in reaching a satisfactory agreement on the terms 
of its long-term mining rights. If PT-FI is unable to reach a 
definitive agreement with the Indonesian government on  
its long-term rights, FCX intends to reduce or defer 
investments significantly in underground development 
projects and will pursue dispute resolution procedures  
under the COW.

Other. In 2016, FCX negotiated the termination and 

settlement of FM O&G’s drilling rig contracts with Noble 
Drilling (U.S.) LLC (Noble) and Rowan Companies plc 
(Rowan). Under the settlement with Noble, FCX issued  
48.1 million shares of its common stock (representing a value 
of $540 million) during second-quarter 2016, and Noble 
immediately sold these shares. Under the settlement with 
Rowan, FCX paid $215 million in cash during 2016. FCX also 
agreed to provide contingent payments of up to $75 million 
to Noble and up to $30 million to Rowan, depending on  
the average price of crude oil over the 12-month period 
ending June 30, 2017. In January 2017, FCX paid $6 million to 
early settle a portion of the Rowan contingent payments  
and no additional payments were due when the contingency 
period ended on June 30, 2017. As a result of the settlements, 
FM O&G was released from a total of $1.1 billion in payment 
obligations under its three drilling rig contracts.

Community Development Programs. FCX has adopted 

policies that govern its working relationships with the 
communities where it operates. These policies are designed 
to guide its practices and programs in a manner that 
respects basic human rights and the culture of the local 
people impacted by FCX’s operations. FCX continues to 
make significant expenditures on community development, 
education, training and cultural programs.

Freeport-McMoRan

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

In 1996, PT-FI established the Freeport Partnership Fund 

NOTE 14. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

for Community Development (Partnership Fund) through 
which PT-FI has made available funding and technical 
assistance to support community development initiatives in 
the areas of health, education and economic development  
of the area. PT-FI has committed through 2018 to provide one 
percent of its annual revenue for the development of the 
local people in its area of operations through the Partnership 
Fund. PT-FI charged $44 million in 2017, $33 million in 2016 
and $27 million in 2015 to cost of sales for this commitment.

Guarantees. FCX provides certain financial guarantees 

(including indirect guarantees of the indebtedness of others) 
and indemnities.

Prior to its acquisition by FCX, FMC and its subsidiaries 

have, as part of merger, acquisition, divestiture and other 
transactions, from time to time, indemnified certain sellers, 
buyers or other parties related to the transaction from  
and against certain liabilities associated with conditions in 
existence (or claims associated with actions taken) prior  
to the closing date of the transaction. As part of these 
transactions, FMC indemnified the counterparty from and 
against certain excluded or retained liabilities existing at the 
time of sale that would otherwise have been transferred  
to the party at closing. These indemnity provisions generally 
now require FCX to indemnify the party against certain 
liabilities that may arise in the future from the pre-closing 
activities of FMC for assets sold or purchased. The indemnity 
classifications include environmental, tax and certain 
operating liabilities, claims or litigation existing at closing and 
various excluded liabilities or obligations. Most of these 
indemnity obligations arise from transactions that closed 
many years ago, and given the nature of these indemnity 
obligations, it is not possible to estimate the maximum 
potential exposure. Except as described in the following 
sentence, FCX does not consider any of such obligations as 
having a probable likelihood of payment that is reasonably 
estimable, and accordingly, has not recorded any obligations 
associated with these indemnities. With respect to FCX’s 
environmental indemnity obligations, any expected costs 
from these guarantees are accrued when potential 
environmental obligations are considered by management to 
be probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated.

FCX does not purchase, hold or sell derivative financial 
instruments unless there is an existing asset or obligation, or 
it anticipates a future activity that is likely to occur and will 
result in exposure to market risks, which FCX intends to 
offset or mitigate. FCX does not enter into any derivative 
financial instruments for speculative purposes, but has 
entered into derivative financial instruments in limited 
instances to achieve specific objectives. These objectives 
principally relate to managing risks associated with 
commodity price changes, foreign currency exchange rates 
and interest rates.

Commodity Contracts. From time to time, FCX has entered 

into derivative contracts to hedge the market risk associated 
with fluctuations in the prices of commodities it purchases 
and sells. Derivative financial instruments used by FCX to 
manage its risks do not contain credit risk-related contingent 
provisions. As a result of the acquisition of the oil and gas 
business in 2013, FCX assumed a variety of crude oil and 
natural gas commodity derivatives to hedge the exposure to 
the volatility of crude oil and natural gas commodity prices, 
all of which had matured by December 31, 2015. As of 
December 31, 2017 and 2016, FCX had no price protection 
contracts relating to its mine production. A discussion of 
FCX’s derivative contracts and programs follows.

Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments— 
Fair Value Hedges

Copper Futures and Swap Contracts. Some of FCX’s U.S. copper 
rod customers request a fixed market price instead of the 
COMEX average copper price in the month of shipment. FCX 
hedges this price exposure in a manner that allows it to 
receive the COMEX average price in the month of shipment 
while the customers pay the fixed price they requested. FCX 
accomplishes this by entering into copper futures or swap 
contracts. Hedging gains or losses from these copper futures 
and swap contracts are recorded in revenues. FCX did not 
have any significant gains or losses during the three years 
ended December 31, 2017, resulting from hedge ineffectiveness. 
At December 31, 2017, FCX held copper futures and swap 
contracts that qualified for hedge accounting for 41 million 
pounds at an average contract price of $3.02 per pound, 
with maturities through June 2019.

pricing primarily based on the LME copper price or the 
COMEX copper price and the London gold price at the time 
of shipment as specified in the contract. Similarly, FCX 
purchases copper and cobalt under contracts that provide 
for provisional pricing. Mark-to-market price fluctuations  
from these embedded derivatives are recorded through the 
settlement date and are reflected in revenues for sales 
contracts and in cost of sales as production and delivery costs 
for purchase contracts. A summary of FCX’s embedded 
derivatives at December 31, 2017, follows:

Crude Oil and Natural Gas Contracts. As a result of the 
acquisition of the oil and gas business, FCX had derivative 
contracts that consisted of crude oil options, and crude oil 
and natural gas swaps. These derivatives were not designated 
as hedging instruments and were recorded at fair value  
with the mark-to-market gains and losses recorded in 
revenues. The crude oil options were entered into by PXP to  
protect the realized price of a portion of expected future 
sales in order to limit the effects of crude oil price 
decreases. The remaining contracts matured in 2015, and 
FCX had no outstanding crude oil or natural gas derivative 
contracts as of December 31, 2017 or 2016.

As part of the terms of the agreement to sell the onshore 

California oil and gas properties, FM O&G entered  
into derivative contracts during October 2016 to hedge  
(i) approximately 72 percent of its forecasted crude oil sales 
through 2020 with fixed-rate swaps for 19.4 million barrels 
from November 2016 through December 2020 at a price  
of $56.04 per barrel and costless collars for 5.2 million 
barrels from January 2018 through December 2020 at a put 
price of $50.00 per barrel and a call price of $63.69 per 
barrel, and (ii) approximately 48 percent of its forecasted 
natural gas purchases through 2020 with fixed-rate swaps 
for 28.9 million British thermal units (MMBtu) from 
November 2016 through December 2020 at a price of 
$3.1445 per MMBtu related to these onshore California 
properties. Sentinel assumed these contracts at the time of 
the sale in December 2016. These derivative contracts were 
not designated as hedges for accounting purposes, and were 
recorded at fair value with the mark-to-market gains and 
losses recorded in revenues (oil contracts) and production 
costs (natural gas contracts).

Copper Forward Contracts. Atlantic Copper, FCX’s wholly 

owned smelting and refining unit in Spain, enters into 
copper forward contracts designed to hedge its copper price 
risk whenever its physical purchases and sales pricing 
periods do not match. These economic hedge transactions 
are intended to hedge against changes in copper prices,  
with the mark-to-market hedging gains or losses recorded in 
cost of sales. At December 31, 2017, Atlantic Copper held  
net copper forward sales contracts for 4 million pounds at an 
average contract price of $3.11 per pound, with maturities 
through February 2018.

FCX’s commodity contracts have netting arrangements 

with counterparties with which the right of offset exists,  
and it is FCX’s policy to generally offset balances by 
counterparty on the balance sheet. FCX’s embedded

netted with the corresponding outstanding receivable/

Credit Risk. FCX is exposed to credit loss when financial 

institutions with which it has entered into derivative 
transactions (commodity, foreign exchange and interest 
rate swaps) are unable to pay. To minimize the risk of such 
losses, FCX uses counterparties that meet certain credit 
requirements and periodically reviews the creditworthiness 
of these counterparties. FCX does not anticipate that any  
of the counterparties it deals with will default on their 
obligations. As of December 31, 2017, the maximum amount 
of credit exposure associated with derivative transactions 
was $166 million.

Other Financial Instruments. Other financial instruments 

include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable,  
restricted cash, investment securities, legally restricted funds, 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and long-term debt. 
The carrying value for cash and cash equivalents (which 
included time deposits of $2.9 billion at December 31, 2017, 
and $64 million at December 31, 2016), accounts receivable, 
restricted cash, and accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
approximates fair value because of their short-term nature 
and generally negligible credit losses (refer to Note 15 for the 
fair values of investment securities, legally restricted funds 
and long-term debt).

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

In addition, as of December 31, 2017, FCX has contingent 

consideration assets related to certain 2016 asset sales (refer 
to Note 15 for the related fair value and to Note 2 for further 
discussion of these instruments).

NOTE 15. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT

Fair value accounting guidance includes a hierarchy that 
prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to 
measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority 
to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical 
assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to 
unobservable inputs (Level 3). FCX recognizes transfers 
between levels at the end of the reporting period. FCX  

did not have any significant transfers in or out of Level 1, 2 
or 3 for 2017.

FCX’s financial instruments are recorded on the 

consolidated balance sheets at fair value except for contingent 
consideration associated with the sale of the Deepwater  
GOM oil and gas properties (which was recorded under the 
loss recovery approach) and debt. A summary of the  
carrying amount and fair value of FCX’s financial instruments

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Valuation Techniques. The U.S. core fixed income fund is 
valued at NAV. The fund strategy seeks total return consisting 
of income and capital appreciation primarily by investing in  
a broad range of investment-grade debt securities, including 
U.S. government obligations, corporate bonds, mortgage-
backed securities, asset-backed securities and money market 
instruments. There are no restrictions on redemptions 
(which are usually within one business day of notice).

Money market funds are classified within Level 1 of the  

fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted 
market prices in active markets.

Equity securities are valued at the closing price reported 
on the active market on which the individual securities are 
traded and, as such, are classified within Level 1 of the fair 
value hierarchy.

reporting date based on the month of maturity (refer to 
Note 14 for further discussion). Certain of these contracts are 
traded on the over-the-counter market and are classified 
within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy based on COMEX 
and LME forward prices.

The fair value of contingent consideration for the sales  

of TFHL and onshore California oil and gas properties (refer  
to Note 2 for further discussion) is calculated based on 
average commodity price forecasts through applicable 
maturity dates using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The 
models use various observable inputs, including Brent  
crude oil forward prices, historical copper and cobalt prices, 
volatilities, discount rates and settlement terms. As a  
result, these contingent consideration assets are classified 
within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

Fixed income securities (government securities, corporate 

The fair value of contingent consideration for the sale of 

bonds, asset-backed securities, collateralized mortgage-
backed securities and municipal bonds) are valued using a 
bid-evaluation price or a mid-evaluation price. A bid-evaluation  
price is an estimated price at which a dealer would pay for a 
security. A mid-evaluation price is the average of the 
estimated price at which a dealer would sell a security and 
the estimated price at which a dealer would pay for a 
security. These evaluations are based on quoted prices, if 
available, or models that use observable inputs and, as such, 
are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
FCX’s embedded derivatives on provisional copper 

concentrate, copper cathode and gold purchases and sales 
are valued using only quoted monthly LME or COMEX copper 
forward prices and the London gold forward price at each 
reporting date based on the month of maturity (refer to  
Note 14 for further discussion); however, FCX’s contracts 
themselves are not traded on an exchange. As a result,  
these derivatives are classified within Level 2 of the fair 
value hierarchy.

Deepwater GOM oil and gas properties (refer to Note 2 for 
further discussion) is calculated based on a discounted cash 
flow model using inputs that include third-party reserve 
estimates, production rates, production timing and discount 
rates. Because significant inputs are not observable in  
the market, the contingent consideration is classified within 
Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

The December 31, 2016, fair value of contingent payments 

for the settlements of drilling rig contracts (refer to Note 13 
for further discussion) was calculated based on the average 
price forecasts of WTI crude oil over the 12-month period 
ending June 30, 2017, using a mean-reverting model. The 
model used various observable inputs, including WTI crude 
oil forward prices, volatilities, discount rate and settlement 
terms. As a result, these contingent payments were classified 
within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

Long-term debt, including current portion, is valued  

using available market quotes and, as such, is classified within 
Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

FCX’s embedded derivatives on provisional cobalt purchases 

The techniques described above may produce a fair value 

are valued using quoted monthly LME cobalt forward prices  
or average published Metals Bulletin cobalt prices, subject to 
certain adjustments as specified by the terms of the 
contracts, at each reporting date based on the month of 
maturity (Level 2).

FCX’s derivative financial instruments for copper futures 

and swap contracts and copper forward contracts that  
are traded on the respective exchanges are classified within 
Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued 
using quoted monthly COMEX or LME prices at each 

calculation that may not be indicative of NRV or reflective  
of future fair values. Furthermore, while FCX believes its 
valuation techniques are appropriate and consistent with 
those used by other market participants, the use of different 
techniques or assumptions to determine fair value of 
certain financial instruments could result in a different fair 
value measurement at the reporting date. There have been 
no changes in the techniques used at December 31, 2017.

mining operations, which were determined using inputs not 
observable in the market and thus represent Level 3 
measurements.

a.  Revenues are attributed to countries based on the location of the customer.

Major Customers and Affiliated Companies. Copper concentrate 
sales to PT Smelting totaled 12 percent of FCX’s consolidated 
revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017, which is the 
only customer that accounted for 10 percent or more of 
FCX’s consolidated revenues during the three years ended 
December 31, 2017.

Consolidated revenues include sales to the noncontrolling 

interest owners of FCX’s South America mining operations 
totaling $1.1 billion in 2017 and $1.0 billion in both 2016 and 
2015, and PT-FI’s sales to PT Smelting totaling $2.0 billion  
in 2017, $1.4 billion in 2016 and $1.1 billion in 2015.

Labor Matters. As of December 31, 2017, approximately  

40 percent of FCX’s global labor force was covered by 
collective bargaining agreements, and approximately 15 percent 
was covered by agreements that expired and are currently 
being negotiated or will expire within one year.

Business Segments. FCX has organized its mining 

operations into four primary divisions—North America copper 
mines, South America mining, Indonesia mining and 
Molybdenum mines, and operating segments that meet 
certain thresholds are reportable segments. Separately 
disclosed in the following tables are FCX’s reportable 
segments, which include the Morenci, Cerro Verde and 
Grasberg (Indonesia Mining) copper mines, the Rod & 
Refining operations and Atlantic Copper Smelting & Refining.
FCX’s reportable segments previously included U.S. Oil & Gas 

operations. During 2016, FCX completed the sales of its 
Deepwater GOM, onshore California and Haynesville oil and 
gas properties. As a result, beginning in 2017, the U.S. Oil & Gas 
operations no longer qualify as a reportable segment, and oil 
and gas results for all periods presented have been included 
in Corporate, Other & Eliminations in the following tables. 
Refer to Note 2 for further discussion of these sales.

2017 Annual Report

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Intersegment sales between FCX’s business segments are 

South America Mining. South America mining includes  

based on terms similar to arms-length transactions with  
third parties at the time of the sale. Intersegment sales may 
not be reflective of the actual prices ultimately realized 
because of a variety of factors, including additional processing, 
timing of sales to unaffiliated customers and transportation 
premiums. In addition, intersegment sales from Tenke to 
FCX’s other consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated in 
discontinued operations (refer to Note 2).

FCX defers recognizing profits on sales from its mines to 

other divisions, including Atlantic Copper (FCX’s wholly 
owned smelter and refinery in Spain) and on 25 percent of 
PT-FI’s sales to PT Smelting (PT-FI’s 25-percent-owned 
smelter and refinery in Indonesia), until final sales to third 
parties occur. Quarterly variations in ore grades, the timing  
of intercompany shipments and changes in product prices 
result in variability in FCX’s net deferred profits and 
quarterly earnings.

FCX allocates certain operating costs, expenses and 

capital expenditures to its operating divisions and individual 
segments. However, not all costs and expenses applicable  
to an operation are allocated. U.S. federal and state income 
taxes are recorded and managed at the corporate level 
(included in Corporate, Other & Eliminations), whereas foreign 
income taxes are recorded and managed at the applicable 
country level. In addition, most mining exploration and 
research activities are managed on a consolidated basis, and 
those costs along with some selling, general and administrative 
costs, are not allocated to the operating divisions or 
individual segments. Accordingly, the following segment 
information reflects management determinations that may 
not be indicative of what the actual financial performance of 
each operating division or segment would be if it was an 
independent entity.

North America Copper Mines. FCX operates seven 

open-pit copper mines in North America—Morenci, Bagdad, 
Safford, Sierrita and Miami in Arizona, and Chino and Tyrone 
in New Mexico. The North America copper mines include 
open-pit mining, sulfide ore concentrating, leaching and  
SX/EW operations. A majority of the copper produced at the 
North America copper mines is cast into copper rod by  
FCX’s Rod & Refining segment. In addition to copper, certain 
of FCX’s North America copper mines also produce 
molybdenum concentrate, gold and silver.

The Morenci open-pit mine, located in southeastern 

Arizona, produces copper cathode and copper concentrate. 
In addition to copper, the Morenci mine also produces 
molybdenum concentrate. The Morenci mine produced  
49 percent of FCX’s North America copper during 2017.

two operating copper mines—Cerro Verde in Peru and  
El Abra in Chile. These operations include open-pit mining, 
sulfide ore concentrating, leaching and SX/EW operations.

The Cerro Verde open-pit copper mine, located near 
Arequipa, Peru, produces copper cathode and copper 
concentrate. In addition to copper, the Cerro Verde mine also 
produces molybdenum concentrate and silver. The Cerro 
Verde mine produced 86 percent of FCX’s South America 
copper during 2017.

Indonesia Mining. Indonesia mining includes PT-FI’s 

Grasberg minerals district that produces copper concentrate 
that contains significant quantities of gold and silver.

Molybdenum Mines. Molybdenum mines include the wholly 

owned Henderson underground mine and Climax open-pit 
mine, both in Colorado. The Henderson and Climax mines 
produce high-purity, chemical-grade molybdenum concentrate, 
which is typically further processed into value-added 
molybdenum chemical products.

Rod & Refining. The Rod & Refining segment consists of 
copper conversion facilities located in North America, and 
includes a refinery, three rod mills and a specialty copper 
products facility, which are combined in accordance with 
segment reporting aggregation guidance. These operations 
process copper produced at FCX’s North America copper 
mines and purchased copper into copper cathode, rod and 
custom copper shapes. At times these operations refine 
copper and produce copper rod and shapes for customers  
on a toll basis. Toll arrangements require the tolling customer 
to deliver appropriate copper-bearing material to FCX’s 
facilities for processing into a product that is returned to the 
customer, who pays FCX for processing its material into the 
specified products.

Atlantic Copper Smelting & Refining. Atlantic Copper 

smelts and refines copper concentrate and markets refined 
copper and precious metals in slimes. During 2017, Atlantic 
Copper purchased 18 percent of its concentrate requirements 
from the North America copper mines and 15 percent  
from the South America mining operations, with the remainder 
purchased from third parties.

Corporate, Other & Eliminations. Corporate, Other & 

Eliminations consists of FCX’s other mining and eliminations, 
oil and gas operations and other corporate and elimination 
items. Other mining and eliminations include the Miami 
smelter (a smelter at FCX’s Miami, Arizona, mining operation), 
Freeport Cobalt (a cobalt chemical refinery in Kokkola, 
Finland), molybdenum conversion facilities in the U.S. and 
Europe, five non-operating copper mines in North America 
(Ajo, Bisbee, Tohono, Twin Buttes and Christmas in Arizona) 
and other mining support entities.

All of the senior notes issued by FCX and discussed in Note 8 
are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior basis 
jointly and severally by FM O&G LLC, as guarantor, which is a 
100-percent-owned subsidiary of FM O&G and FCX. The 
guarantee is an unsecured obligation of the guarantor and 
ranks equal in right of payment with all existing and future 
indebtedness of FM O&G LLC, including indebtedness  
under FCX’s revolving credit facility. The guarantee ranks 
senior in right of payment with all of FM O&G LLC’s future 
subordinated obligations and is effectively subordinated in 

right of payment to any debt of FM O&G LLC’s subsidiaries. 
The indentures provide that FM O&G LLC’s guarantee may be 
released or terminated for certain obligations under the 
following circumstances: (i) all or substantially all of the equity 
interests or assets of FM O&G LLC are sold to a third party;  
or (ii) FM O&G LLC no longer has any obligations under any 
FM O&G senior notes or any refinancing thereof and no 
longer guarantees any obligations of FCX under the revolving 
credit facility or any other senior debt or, in each case, any 
refinancing thereof.

a.  Consolidated recoverable copper reserves included 2.1 billion pounds in leach stockpiles and 0.7 billion 

pounds in mill stockpiles.

b.  Recoverable proven and probable reserves reflect estimates of minerals that can be recovered 

through the end of 2041 (refer to Note 13 for discussion of PT-FI’s COW).

c.  Consolidated reserves represent estimated metal quantities after reduction for joint venture partner 

interests at the Morenci mine in North America and the Grasberg minerals district in Indonesia  
(refer to Note 3 for further discussion of FCX’s joint ventures). Excluded from the table above were 
FCX’s estimated recoverable proven and probable reserves of 273.4 million ounces of silver, which 
were determined using $15 per ounce.

d.  Net equity interest reserves represent estimated consolidated metal quantities further reduced for 

noncontrolling interest ownership (refer to Note 3 for further discussion of FCX’s ownership in 
subsidiaries). Excluded from the table above were FCX’s estimated recoverable proven and probable 
reserves of 218.2 million ounces of silver.

	

	

NOTE 20. SUPPLEMENTARY MINERAL RESERVE 
INFORMATION (UNAUDITED)

Recoverable proven and probable reserves have been 
calculated as of December 31, 2017, in accordance with 
Industry Guide 7 as required by the Securities Exchange Act 
of 1934. FCX’s proven and probable reserves may not be 
comparable to similar information regarding mineral reserves 
disclosed in accordance with the guidance in other countries. 
Proven and probable reserves were determined by the use of 
mapping, drilling, sampling, assaying and evaluation methods 
generally applied in the mining industry, as more fully 
discussed below. The term “reserve,” as used in the reserve 
data presented here, means that part of a mineral deposit 
that can be economically and legally extracted or produced 
at the time of the reserve determination. The term “proven 
reserves” means reserves for which (i) quantity is computed 
from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings  
or drill holes; (ii) grade and/or quality are computed from the 
results of detailed sampling; and (iii) the sites for inspection, 
sampling and measurements are spaced so closely and the 
geologic character is sufficiently defined that size, shape, 
depth and mineral content of reserves are well established. 
The term “probable reserves” means reserves for which 
quantity and grade are computed from information similar to 
that used for proven reserves but the sites for sampling are 
farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced. The 
degree of assurance, although lower than that for proven 
reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points 
of observation.

FCX’s reserve estimates are based on the latest available 

geological and geotechnical studies. FCX conducts ongoing 
studies of its ore bodies to optimize economic values and  
to manage risk. FCX revises its mine plans and estimates of 
proven and probable mineral reserves as required in 
accordance with the latest available studies.

Estimated recoverable proven and probable reserves at 

December 31, 2017, were determined using $2.00 per pound for 
copper, $1,000 per ounce for gold and $10 per pound for 
molybdenum. For the three-year period ended December 31, 
2017, LME spot copper prices averaged $2.50 per pound, 
London PM gold prices averaged $1,223 per ounce and the 
weekly average price for molybdenum quoted by Metals Week 
averaged $7.12 per pound.

NOTE 21. SUPPLEMENTARY OIL AND GAS 
INFORMATION (UNAUDITED)

Following the sales of substantially all of FCX’s oil and gas 
properties, including the sale of its Deepwater GOM, onshore 
California and Haynesville oil and gas properties in 2016, 
along with the sales of its property interests in the Madden 
area in central Wyoming and certain property interests in  
the GOM Shelf in 2017, FCX’s oil and gas producing activities 
are not considered significant beginning in 2017. Refer to 
Note 2 for further discussion.

Costs Incurred. A summary of the costs incurred for  

FCX’s oil and gas acquisition, exploration and development 
activities for the years ended December 31, 2016 and

(BOE) was $17.58 in 2016 and $33.46 in 2015.

Costs Not Subject to Amortization. Including amounts 

determined to be impaired, FCX transferred $4.9 billion  
of costs associated with unevaluated properties to the full  
cost pool in 2016. Sales of unevaluated properties totaled 
$1.6 billion in 2016. Following FCX’s disposition of its 
Deepwater GOM and onshore California oil and gas properties 
in fourth-quarter 2016, the carrying value of all of FCX’s 
remaining oil and gas properties was included in the 
amortization base at December 31, 2017 and 2016.

Proved Oil and Natural Gas Reserve Information. The following 
information summarizes the net proved reserves of oil 
(including condensate and natural gas liquids (NGLs)), and 
natural gas and the standardized measure as described 
below for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. All of 
FCX’s oil and natural gas reserves are located in the U.S.

Management believes the reserve estimates presented 

herein are reasonable and prepared in accordance with 
guidelines established by the SEC as prescribed in Regulation 
S-X, Rule 4-10. However, there are numerous uncertainties 
inherent in estimating quantities and values of proved 
reserves and in projecting future rates of production and the 
amount and timing of development expenditures, including 
many factors beyond FCX’s control. Reserve engineering is a 
subjective process of estimating the recovery from 
underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot 
be measured in an exact manner, and the accuracy of any 
reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data 
and of engineering and geological interpretation and 
judgment. Because all oil and natural gas reserve estimates 
are to some degree subjective, the quantities of oil and 
natural gas that are ultimately recovered, production and 
operating costs, the amount and timing of future development 
expenditures, and future crude oil and natural gas sales 
prices may all differ from those assumed in these estimates. 
In addition, different reserve engineers may make different 
estimates of reserve quantities and cash flows based upon 

2017 Annual Report

129

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

the same available data. Therefore, the standardized measure 
of discounted future net cash flows (Standardized Measure) 
shown below represents estimates only and should not be 
construed as the current market value of the estimated 
reserves attributable to FCX’s oil and gas properties. In this 
regard, the information set forth in the following tables 
includes revisions of reserve estimates attributable to 
proved properties acquired from PXP and MMR, and reflects 
additional information from subsequent development 
activities, production history of the properties involved and 
any adjustments in the projected economic life of such 
properties resulting from changes in product prices.

Estimated Quantities of Oil and Natural Gas Reserves. The 

following table sets forth certain data pertaining to proved, 
proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves, all of 
which are in the U.S., for the years ended December 31, 2016

Freeport-McMoRan

For the year ended December 31, 2015, FCX had a total of  
17 MMBOE of extensions and discoveries, including  
14 MMBOE in the Deepwater GOM, primarily associated with 
the development at Horn Mountain, and 3 MMBOE in the 
Haynesville shale assets resulting from drilling that extended 
and developed FCX’s proved acreage.

For the year ended December 31, 2015, FCX had net 

negative revisions of 102 MMBOE primarily related to lower 
oil and gas price realizations.

The average realized sales prices used in FCX’s reserve 

reports as of December 31, 2016, were $34.26 per barrel of 
crude oil and $2.40 per one thousand cubic feet (Mcf) of 
natural gas. Excluding the impact of crude oil derivative 
contracts, as of December 31, 2015, the average realized sales 
prices used in FCX’s reserve report were $47.80 per barrel  
of crude oil and $2.55 per Mcf.

For the year ended December 31, 2016, FCX sold reserves 

in-place totaling 187 MMBOE, primarily representing all  
of its Deepwater GOM, onshore California and Haynesville 
properties.

Standardized Measure. The Standardized Measure 

(discounted at 10 percent) from production of proved oil and 
natural gas reserves has been developed in accordance  
with SEC guidelines. FCX estimated the quantity of proved oil 
and natural gas reserves and the future periods in which  
they were expected to be produced based on year-end 
economic conditions. Estimates of future net revenues from 
FCX’s proved oil and gas properties and the present value 
thereof were made using the twelve-month average of the 
first-day-of-the-month historical reference prices as adjusted 
for location and quality differentials, which were held 
constant throughout the life of the oil and gas properties, 
except where such guidelines permit alternate treatment, 
including the use of fixed and determinable contractual price 
escalations (excluding the impact of crude oil derivative 
contracts). Future gross revenues were reduced by estimated 
future operating costs (including production and ad valorem 
taxes) and future development and abandonment costs,  
all of which were based on current costs in effect at 
December 31, 2016 and 2015, and held constant throughout 
the life of the oil and gas properties. Future income taxes 
were calculated by applying the statutory federal and state 
income tax rate to pre-tax future net cash flows, net of the 
tax basis of the respective oil and gas properties and 
utilization of FCX’s available tax carryforwards related to its 
oil and gas operations.
