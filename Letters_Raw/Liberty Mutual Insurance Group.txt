In 2016, our commitment 
to innovation, growth and 
protecting our customers 
was on full display. In this 
annual review, we take a 
moment to reﬂ ect upon the 
achievements of our three 
strategic business units. 
While each has a unique 
story to tell, together, their 
expertise, efforts and vision 
align to strengthen our 
company’s foundation 
for the future.

Letter from Our CEO

2016, including the merging 
of Personal Insurance and 
Liberty International to form 
Global Consumer Markets 
— a move that enables us to 
leverage our expertise, tal-
ent and scale in operations 
throughout the world. In 2016, 
we entered an agreement to 
acquire Ironshore Inc., a pre-
mier specialty lines company 
that complements Global 
Specialty’s and solidiﬁ es our 
position as a leader in the 
specialty space. Commercial 
Insurance also entered the 
third phase of a multi-year 
transformation last year, and 
with its new structure, is now 
well positioned to invest, build 
and grow in the coming years. 

These are just a few efforts 
that led to solid operating 
results in 2016, including 
growing to $20 billion in 
equity and generating a core 
combined ratio of 93 per-
cent, down six points from 
just ﬁ ve years ago. We grew 
net written premium 3.4 
percent to $35.7 billion with 
approximately $1 billion of 
net income for the year. We 
achieved this despite 2016 
experiencing higher than 

normal catastrophe losses, 
unfavorable loss trends within 
our personal and commercial 
auto product lines, height-
ened competition and con-
tinued low interest rates.

Also impacting 2016 results 
were pre-tax charges of 
roughly $200 million associ-
ated with realized investment 
losses and debt buybacks. 
The losses were largely re-
lated to impairments of direct 
investments in oil and gas 
wells reﬂ ecting unprecedent-
ed price declines in the ener-
gy sector of the economy. In 
regards to the debt buybacks, 
we repurchased $125 mil-
lion of our high coupon debt, 
which will provide signiﬁ cant 
future interest savings.

We saw notable accomplish-
ments beyond our business 
operations. We climbed to 
#73 on the Fortune 500 list 
and were named a “Great 
Place to Work” in recognition 
of our ongoing commitment 
to create a ﬂ exible, diverse 
and inclusive workplace that 
attracts top talent. We cele-
brated our ﬁ fth anniversary 
of Serve with Liberty — our

In 2016, Liberty Mutual In-
surance Group continued 
to build on our promise to 
be there when our cus-
tomers need us most.

In this report, we share sto-

In closing, I’d like to thank the 
Board of Directors for their 
guidance and expertise this 
past year as well as our ded-

partners — the independent 
agents and brokers who bring 
our services to those in need.  

I also thank our employees

employees from 21 countries 
serving; and commemorated 
the 10th anniversary of Give

generosity of our employees.

There’s no denying that we 
are at a new and exciting 
point in our history. The world

the expectations of our cus-

We face a high degree of 
economic and geopolitical 
uncertainty in markets around 
the world. Technology is 
advancing at an exponential 
rate, transforming the way we 
live and interact faster than 
at any point in our history. 
Yet, in spite of this acceler-
ating pace of change, we 
continue to thrive thanks to 
our strong capital position,

our talent and our unwav-

Global Consumer Markets (GCM)

Established in February 2016, Liberty Mutual Insurance Group’s Global Consumer 
Markets (GCM) strategic business unit combines the company’s U.S. Personal 
Insurance business unit with its International business unit. GCM sells private 
passenger automobile, homeowners, and specialty property and casualty products, 
including watercraft, motorcycle, recreational vehicle and umbrella coverage in 
the U.S. under the Liberty Mutual Insurance and Safeco Insurance brands. GCM 
also sells consumer and small commercial insurance products in 16 countries.

This union has given GCM global scale and capabilities, matched 
with local knowledge, talent, innovation and agility.

every day imagining, designing, supporting and delivering 
exceptional customer experiences across the globe."

2016 Highlights

Liberty Stands with You

For GCM, 2016 underscored our commitment to putting customers at 
the center of all we do. GCM’s U.S. division launched its new “Liberty 
Stands with You” brand campaign, more overtly demonstrating how 
Liberty empowers customers to live life without worry.

All Set

We heightened our focus on innovation with the launch of All 
Set, a home-service referral and group discount app, and with 
an investment in August Home, a connected home service. 

Sanpower Group Co., Ltd.

Over the past year, GCM made signiﬁ cant moves to strengthen 
our global positions. It entered an agreement with Sanpower 
Group Co., Ltd., one of China's leading private enterprises, to 
create a joint venture from our existing operation in China. Pending 
local regulatory approval, the transaction is intended to enhance 
the operation's competitiveness, allowing Liberty to maintain a 
strategic presence in one of the world's largest markets. 

Expansion in India

GCM also grew our investment in India, increasing ownership 
to 49 percent of our insurance joint venture company. The move 
reﬂ ects our growing conﬁ dence in the India market.

Enhanced 
Personalization

This past year, we piloted new products 
like Notion to offer home telematics and 
leveraged data and technology. Our ul-
timate goal is to provide customers with 
more personalized messages and expe-
riences, reinforcing that we are there for 
them — when, and how, they need us.

MasterThisTM

In 2016, GCM introduced MasterThis™, 
a groundbreaking digital content hub com-
plete with articles, videos and interactive 
features that helps customers address 
auto and home worries beyond insurance. 
Customers can use it to create moving 
plans, stock an emergency car kit, ﬁ nd a 
trustworthy mechanic and more. Ultimate-
ly, it delivers actionable value that Liber-
ty Mutual’s competitors cannot match.

Liberty 
Seguros

GCM’s Brazil operation, Liberty Seguros, 
has embraced customer-ﬁ rst innovations 
that include a mix of digital and human-
centered tools. By producing customer 
journey maps, Liberty Seguros employees 
gained unique perspective into customer 
needs in key moments. The operation also 
offers online reporting of loss and status 
updates and recently integrated a state-of-
the-art function to its Claims Core System. 
As a result, Liberty moves information 
more efﬁ ciently — and customers get 
what they want quickly and easily.

Commercial Insurance (CI)

Commercial Insurance (CI) is dedicated to meeting the comprehensive 
insurance needs of businesses and individuals. Through independent agents 
and brokers, CI offers auto, general liability, property, workers compensation and 
specialty coverages to small, midsize and large businesses in the U.S. CI also 
offers employer and individual beneﬁ ts, products and services such as group 
life, group disability, and accident and health through brokers and consultants 
as well as individual ﬁ nancial products through banks and other channels.

“We have deepened our commitment to protecting businesses 
and helping them succeed through new tools and resources 
and an expanded product offering.”

2016 ANNUAL REVIEW  |  17

2016 Highlights

New Products, Expanded Protection

The employee beneﬁ ts market is changing, creating a whole 
new set of customer needs. To address them, CI launched three 
voluntary products in 2016: group accident, critical illness and 
hospital indemnity. The products provide added protection for 
employees and families while also helping broker and consultant 
partners fulﬁ ll the needs of their employer clients.

Smart, More Personalized Communication

This past year, CI introduced personalized video 
communications designed to provide injured workers with 
important workers compensation claims information in a more 
timely and interactive way. This added touch point improves 
engagement and the overall claims experience, ultimately 
helping workers recover and return to work sooner.

Innovating for Faster Service Delivery

We continue to make enhancements to eCLIQ, our commercial all-
lines quoting platform, to offer an experience tailored to individual 
exposures that provides the ﬂ exibility, speed and accuracy agents 
need so they can provide better service and grow their client base.

Expanded Vertical Expertise

We launched new industry verticals for the healthcare 
and public entity sectors. Our expertise and consultative 
approach across underwriting, risk control and claims in 
these verticals will enable us to quickly and efﬁ ciently address 
sector-speciﬁ c trends and exposures so we can better meet 
the needs of our business partners and customers.

Delivering Data-
Driven Service

In today’s data-driven world, having 
historical trends, facts and ﬁ gures is 
invaluable when it comes to proactively 
managing risk. CI takes an innovative 
and scientiﬁ c approach to helping cus-
tomers understand their most pressing 
exposures, identify root causes of risk 
and implement actionable solutions to 
improve safety and reduce losses.

Mitigating 
Damage, 
Minimizing 
Disruption 

In 2016, more than 5,600 hailstorms 
rained down on the U.S., leaving exten-
sive losses in their wakes. CI’s propri-
etary hail tool enables property loss con-
trol engineers to look at location-speciﬁ c 
factors, such as roof type, age, condition 
and geocode, to provide a more detailed 
view of a customer’s hail exposure, pin-
pointing the areas at most risk. They also 
provide speciﬁ c recommendations, such 
as repairing small blisters and installing 
protective screens over skylights, to miti-
gate damage. With this information, cus-
tomers can then prioritize risk manage-
ment efforts on locations with the most 
potential for loss, minimizing damage and 
potential disruption to their operations.  

Reducing Accidents, 
Lowering Costs

Managing commercial auto costs con-
tinues to be a challenge for customers. 
As the economy moves upward, there 
are more vehicles on the road driving 
more miles. This increased activity, 
combined with phone and other be-
hind-the-wheel distractions, can result 
in more accidents and claims. CI intro-
duced its Managing Vital Driving 
Performance (MVDP) tool that uses 
customers’ telematics data to monitor 
unsafe driver behaviors, such as speed-
ing, sharp turns and hard or sudden 
braking, that can lead to accidents.

This information enables a risk man-
ager to take actions to improve driving 
performance before an accident hap-
pens. Early results show that customers 
using MVDP experienced 15 percent 
fewer crashes than expected.

leading operating units: Liberty Specialty Markets (LSM), Liberty International

than 170 countries worldwide, and we deliver deep technical expertise and 
strong engagement with our brokers and clients.

Meeting Market Challenges 

Despite an increasingly competitive global market, Global 
Specialty continued its strong proﬁ tability in 2016 by focusing 
on analytics, distribution management, expenses, innovation 
and technology.

Expanding Our Offering

LIU U.S. expanded its product suite to include War & Terrorism 
and Transactional Liability. LIU Latin America continued to build 
momentum in the region, launching Asurion while also increasing 
its business presence in Colombia, Puerto Rico and Peru.

Increasing Our Presence

LSM established a new casualty team in Cologne, Germany, and also 
appointed its ﬁ rst representative to the Lloyd’s ofﬁ ce in Beijing, China.

Building Our Bottom Line

LM Surety consolidated its Contract operations to increase efﬁ ciency 
and productivity, and make it easier for agents to do business with 
us. Recently acquired Mexican surety company, Primero Fianzas, 
completed integration and launched its new brand, Liberty Fianzas, 
while shifting its strategic focus toward larger accounts.

Drawing on Data 
to Differentiate 
Our Business

The strategic use of data is increasingly 
critical to success within the specialty 
lines industry. GS is seeking to drive su-
perior business decision-making by build-
ing a broad spectrum of data-driven tools 
to augment our underwriters’ knowledge 
and expertise. By integrating predictive 
models, dashboards and other analytical 
tools into the process of risk selection and 
pricing, GS is building a data-driven cul-
ture, giving us a signiﬁ cant advantage in 
an increasingly competitive marketplace.

Realizing Tangible 
Growth, Now and 
in the Future

GS’s focus on analytics is paying im-
mediate dividends. Surety results have 
improved signiﬁ cantly in 2016 as the use 
of predictive models, along with other 
operational improvements, have gained 
traction. Along with an increased under-
writing appetite, the predictive models 
deployed in Management Liability and 
General Liability are expected to lead to 
growth in these two segments in 2017.

A Predictive 
Approach 
to Driving 
Improvement

In 2016, GS launched new predictive 
models for pricing, frequency and severity 
within the Contract Surety, Management 
Liability and General Liability product 
lines. GS has four additional predictive 
models launching in 2017, with several 
others currently in development. GS also 
launched a global pricing risk manage-
ment initiative, using advanced data to 
establish a framework for continuous 
improvement around technical price, 
rating tools, monitoring and governance. 

GS is also focused on embedding more 
foundational analytical tools across the 
enterprise. Broker management dash-
boards, a catastrophe-model analysis tool 
and ﬁ nancial stress reports are a few ex-
amples deployed in 2016. These founda-
tional reporting and portfolio capabilities 
deliver signiﬁ cant short-term value, while 
also preparing the business for more 
sophisticated analytics tools in the future. 

Business alignment has been a key 
driver in GS’s analytics strategy. As 
predictive models are built, GS un-
derwriters and risk engineers are an 
integral part of the process from the 
beginning, ensuring these tools comple-
ment the knowledge and expertise of 
the underwriter, rather than replace it.
