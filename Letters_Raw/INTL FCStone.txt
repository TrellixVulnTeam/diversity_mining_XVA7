OVERVIEW

VISION & PHILOSOPHY
In 2003, the current management team reconfigured 
the company as a provider of financial services 
focused on under-served clients in niche markets. 
We started with equity of less than $10 million and 
10 people, and with the vision that, with relentless 
effort and execution, a clear focus on providing great 
service and value for our clients, and using common 
sense and doing the right thing rather than the easy 
thing, we could build a global financial business that 
might one day become a credible and recognized 
franchise. 

Our financial “north star” has been the remarkable 
power of compounding on our shareholder capital, 
which we harness to become a bigger and more 
valuable business. In addition, this approach enables 
us to create our own capital runway for growth. 
As a result, we are less dependent on the capital 
markets, and thus can be flexible and opportunistic in 
approaching them. 

Ironically, the great financial crisis of 2008 created 
unexpected opportunities for us to accelerate our 
growth, expand our capabilities and our footprint,  

OUR BUSINESS 
Today, we are a diversified global brokerage 
and financial services firm offering a vertically 
integrated product suite, including high-touch 
execution, electronic access through a wide variety 
of technology platforms in almost every major 
global market and financial product, and insightful 
market intelligence and advice, as well as post-trade 
settlement, clearing and custody services. This is a 
unique product suite outside of the bulge bracket 
banks, and it creates “sticky” relationships with our 
clients. We help these clients access market liquidity, 
maximize profits and manage risk. 

Our businesses are supported by our global 
infrastructure of regulated operating subsidiaries, our 
advanced technology platform and our team of more 

and thus better position ourselves for achieving 
our long-term goal of becoming a larger financial 
business. In the face of a more rigorous and complex 
regulatory framework, we decided to invest in 
retaining our broad capabilities to better serve our 
clients, while many of our competitors withdrew 
from markets and narrowed their offerings. When 
these regulatory and related capital pressures forced 
consolidation amongst smaller players, we became 
an opportunistic consolidator – and at valuations 
that allowed us to keep compounding our book value 
without the need to incur undue amounts of goodwill.

Over the last 15 years our steady, determined and 
disciplined approach has helped us achieve our 
compounding strategy, with shareholder capital 
increasing at a compound annual growth rate of 31%, 
off the back of revenues that grew at 35% C.A.G.R. 
These growth rates declined into the mid-20% range 
as we became larger and as the aftermath of the 
financial crises provided some significant headwinds, 
but despite these headwinds, we believe that we 
were still positive outliers in our industry in terms of 
performance. 

than 1,700 employees (as of September 30, 2018). 
We believe our client-first approach differentiates us 
from large banking institutions, engenders trust and 
has enabled us to establish leadership positions in a 
number of complex fields in financial markets around 
the world.

Our revenue stream is diversified by asset class, 
client type and geography, with a significant portion 
of recurring revenue derived from monetizing client 
balances in the form of consistent and predictable 
interest and fee earnings on the float.

Our Clients
We currently serve more than 20,000 commercial 
and institutional clients, and more than 80,000 
retail clients located in more than 130 countries. We 
believe that our clients value us for our attention to 
their needs, our expertise and flexibility, our global 
reach, our ability to provide access to liquidity in 
hard-to-reach markets, and our status as a well-
capitalized and regulated organization. 

Strategic Position
We believe that we are well-positioned to capitalize 
on key trends impacting the financial services 
sector. In particular, embracing regulatory change 
has created a competitive advantage for us and has 

positioned us well for continued growth. Today’s 
stringent regulatory requirements for financial 
services firms act as barriers to entry, making it 
difficult for existing and new participants to compete 
with our business model. 

We believe we have become a counterparty of 
choice for a number of mid-sized clients that larger 
institutions can no longer profitably serve. Similarly, 
as the number of smaller competitors continues to 
decline due to regulatory challenges and increased 
capital requirements, we have gained market share 
and have taken advantage of attractive acquisition 
opportunities by leveraging our regulatory expertise.

CHAIRMAN’S LETTER

In 2018, we achieved shareholder return on equity of 11.6% and earnings 
per share of $2.87 for the year. Stated after adjustment for the impact 
of recent U.S. tax legislation, we achieved an ROE of 16.0%(1) and EPS 
of $3.98.(1) We believe that this performance places us in the top tier for 
companies in our industry. 

As Chairman, I am proud of the value that the compound effect of consistently strong return on equity 
generates for our shareholders, and we continue to favor it over other measures of value such as stock 
price. As a shareholder myself, I appreciate the multiplier effect it has on our company’s book value. 

We believe that our continued ability to turn strong performance into value for shareholders, coupled 
with the continuation of market trends more favorable to our business, puts us in a position of strength 
and will create new opportunities to deliver more value to our clients and our shareholders going 
forward. 

With an eye toward expanding our flexibility to seize such opportunities, we explored a potential public 
debt offering in October of 2018. However, hewing to our governing principle and discipline of acting 
only when “the price is right,” we chose to withdraw the offering as terms became unfavorable in the 
face of sudden market instability. That said, we will continue to monitor the markets and look to re-
engage investors when conditions permit. 

While industry consolidation continues to generate acquisition opportunities for our company, only 
two met our criteria this year: We strengthened our Global Payments offering by acquiring the fully 
accredited SWIFT Service Bureau from PayCommerce, and we secured an EU-based footprint for INTL 
FCStone post-Brexit with the acquisition in Luxembourg of Carl Kliem S.A. 

Maintaining a strong company culture remains a vital component of our strategy to grow our 
client base and drive shareholder value. Our people continue to be our most important assets, 
and our continuing and constant objectives are to encourage and reward them for innovative and 
entrepreneurial thinking. At the same time, we continue to stress the tenets of teamwork and the 
critical importance of collaborating with colleagues to sell products and services across our platform. 

Into this culture, we welcome Diane L. Cooper, who has joined our board. As President and CEO of GE 
Capital’s Commercial Distribution Business, Diane achieved a record of strong performance amid fierce 
competition and sometimes challenging market environments. She’ll fit in perfectly, and I look forward 
to the depth of knowledge and experience she will bring to the boardroom as we seek to maximize the 
value of our company. 

Moving from a welcome to a farewell, we extend our best wishes to Brian Sephton as he embarks on 
a well-deserved retirement. Currently our head of Compliance and Legal, Brian has filled several key 
roles in our company over his 14 years with us. We are grateful for his tireless efforts, his wise counsel, 
and his unparalleled eye for the critical detail, and we are sad to lose him.

As in previous years, I will close this letter by taking stock of how far we’ve come as a company. Since 
2002, your company has grown operating revenue from $5.2 million to $975.8 million and net income 
from a loss of $300,000 to a profit of $55.5 million this year. Over the same period, shareholder equity 
has grown from $4.3 million to $505.3 million. 

As we know, the unprecedented convergence of historically low interest rates and low volatility 
following the market crash of 2008 severely tested our strategy and our model. Yet, we pressed on, 
and over the last several years have approached or achieved or our targets for return on equity 
and earnings per share (with 2017 a notable exception). Now as interest rates and volatility climb 
back toward their historic norms, we are not only reaping the rewards of our perseverance, but also 
beginning to harness the latent potential of our strategy and our model. 

Against the backdrop of this growth, the past year’s performance, and increasingly favorable market 
conditions, we see our vision for this company truly taking shape. Today, the global markets generate 
wealth and opportunity on a scale unprecedented in history; through our extensive conduits into and 
between those markets, we connect our clients directly to those opportunities and help power their 
growth. In doing so, we power our own. 

None of this would be possible without you, our shareholders, and all the people who deliver value to 
this company every day. We are proud that we are a company run by shareholders for shareholders, 
and as one of you, I remain bullish about our future.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S LETTER

2018 was a record year in which we achieved some significant milestones. Our 
net operating revenue approached $1 billion, shareholder funds now exceed 
$500 million, and we took in more than $100 million in pre-tax earnings. 

Growth in Revenue and Market Share
During the year we saw revenue growth in all our segments – all of which achieved individual high water 
marks – and overall growth in operating revenue of 24%. This was due to organic growth of our client footprint 
as we continue to become a more recognized franchise, and to generally more favorable market conditions. 
Our business performs best when we have moderate volatility and can earn a carry on our customer float, 
and we had both working for us during 2018. Volatility increases risk for hedgers and provides money-
making opportunities for speculators, so it drives more activity from both types of clients. While volatility has 
increased recently, it remains generally low historically. This will likely change as central banks continue to 
withdraw from stimulus and the markets normalize.

During this record-breaking year, we continued to grow our business and build our franchise across both 
commercial clients (i.e. non-financial industry companies, primarily) and institutional clients. Our strong rates 
of growth in both revenue and transactional volumes substantially outpaced the rate of industry growth – 
providing evidence that we have grown market share. Our hard work over many years is starting to pay off as 
we have become a more recognized and respected player in our markets by clients, prospective employees 
and competitors. 

Across all our segments we have margins on incremental revenue of approximately 50% (depending on 
product and business mix), which allows us to achieve significant operating margins if we can contain central 
overheads. During 2018, we achieved an 18% increase in net operating revenues with fixed compensation only 
growing by 4% and all other fixed costs growing by 6%, driving operational leverage to the bottom line. 

Over the last two years, as more normalized market conditions have returned, we now have a number of 
highly predictable revenue sources from interest and fees, which cover an increasingly material portion of 
the central overhead required to operate our franchise. Covering the bulk of our costs with a high degree of 
certainty provides greater “ballast” and predictability to our earnings. 

Adding Companies and Capabilities – Patiently
We continued to see many small-to medium-sized acquisition opportunities – proof that that the industry 
trend towards consolidation continues. We remain patient and disciplined in evaluating these opportunities 
and making sure there is a good cultural fit (a client–first mentality), clear strategic value to our franchise in 
the form of either client relationships or added capabilities, and ability to be financially accretive quickly. Very 
few opportunities pass muster, but we did conclude two small, bolt-on acquisitions during the year, and one 
right after year end, none of which were considered material but all of which add value to our franchise.

than 400 active institutional clients. This acquisition provides us with a diverse offering and complementary 
relationships for a wide range of our products. As a fully regulated EU entity, it also secures our market 
presence in the European Union as the Brexit process plays out. 

PayCommerce Financial Solutions, LLC is a fully accredited SWIFT Service Bureau provider. The acquisition 
enables us to act as a SWIFT Service Bureau for our 300-plus correspondent bank network, thus providing 
another important service for delivering cross-border payments in local currencies to the developing world. 
In addition, we upgraded our regulatory status in Brazil to allow us to handle larger payments locally. While 
this process took the better part of three years to complete, we saw an immediate uptick in revenue as we 
enhanced our capabilities in this key payment corridor. 

Just after year end, we reached agreement to acquire the New York-based broker-dealer formerly known as 
Miller Tabak Roberts, an institutional fixed income business specializing in high yield, convertible, emerging 
market and distressed debt. This acquisition brings with it more than 40 experienced professionals, expands 
our current fixed income product offering, and adds more than 2,400 institutional relationships. We expect 
that our existing clients will benefit from these additions to our offering, while our newly acquired clients will 
benefit from the consolidation of the former Miller Tabak Roberts offering and our own offering. 

Regulation Creates Opportunity
During the year, we saw the MiFID II regulatory regime come into effect (as well as new Basel bank 
requirements) in the European Union. This is an update of MiFID I, and together, they constitute the European 
equivalent of Dodd-Frank. Its aim is to bring greater transparency to financial markets and better protection 
to investors. This is a massive piece of regulation which has had, and will continue to have, wide-ranging and 
perhaps unforeseen consequences. We have taken the view that we are in the regulation business and that 
this in turn provides us with a competitive advantage. We do not believe that our current activities will be 
adversely impacted materially by this new regulation, which has created a more complex environment in 
Europe and for European-based banks and brokers. We believe that this will be a positive development for us 
in the medium term and beyond.

The Downside of Volatility
While moderate volatility drives client activity, extreme volatility causes liquidity stress on our clients that 
must meet margin calls. If they cannot, their accounts are liquidated – resulting in potential losses for these 
clients and perhaps charge-offs for us if they fail to meet their obligations. After our 2018 fiscal year end, we 
experienced just such an event when both natural gas and crude oil experienced historic moves. In the case 
of natural gas, the daily move on successive days reached multiples of the standard exchange requirements. 
A number of FCM client accounts, managed by a commodity trading advisor, were adversely affected by these 
price moves. While we had required significantly increased margin from these accounts, the price moves were 
so extreme that all positions in these accounts had to be liquidated – resulting in a significant aggregate debit 
balance. While the aggregate debit was within our worst-case stress test scenario, it was nonetheless a painful 
reminder that markets can swing suddenly and improbably – more often than we think. We continue to pursue 
collection of these receivables in the ordinary course of business.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S LETTER

STRATEGY
To achieve our vision of becoming a best-in-class financial franchise and our key financial objective of 
compounding our capital at 15%, we need to run a resilient and growing business despite the highly cyclical 
nature of the markets we operate in. 

We focus on mitigating exposure to market risk, ensuring adequate liquidity to maintain our daily operations, 
and making non-interest expenses variable, to the greatest extent possible. Our strategy is to employ 
a centralized and disciplined process for capital allocation, risk management and cost control, while 
delegating the execution of strategic objectives and day-to-day management to our experienced people. This 
requires high-quality managers, a clear communication of performance objectives, and strong financial and 
compliance controls. We believe this strategy will enable us to build a more scalable and significantly larger 
organization that still embraces an entrepreneurial approach to business, supported and underpinned by 
strong centralized financial and compliance controls.

KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS 
We have, since our inception, set out some simple but effective key performance indicators to monitor our 
strategic progress and hold ourselves accountable. Because we take a long-term approach, all of these 
indicators are focused on long-term performance and we recognize that we may underperform at times in 
adverse markets and, similarly, outperform when we have tailwinds.

Compounding Capital:
Target: Annual shareholder return on equity of 15% 
This objective implies growing our net earnings by 
a similar amount annually as our retained earnings 
grow. Our executive and senior management 
compensation plans use this target for annual bonus 
determination. 

20.0%

15.0%

We now have the benefit of evaluating our 
performance through perhaps the worst business 
cycle for financial companies in a generation – 
the great financial crisis. For us this was the worst 
possible environment for our business due to 
historically low volatility crimping client volumes, 
zero interest rates on our client float and significantly 
increased regulatory cost and capital. Despite these 
conditions, we still recorded positive annual ROE 
in the high single digits – below our target, but still 
better than most of our peers. We are pleased that 
our business model achieved the desired result even 
in these dire conditions. 

The chart below presents ROE and Adjusted ROE for 
the last five fiscal years. In fiscal 2014, 2015, and 2016, 
there is no difference between ROE and Adjusted 
ROE. In fiscal 2017, Adjusted ROE excludes the bad 
debt on physical coal, net of incentive recapture. In 
fiscal 2018, Adjusted ROE excludes the impact of H.R. 
1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Reform”) and bad 
debt on physical coal. A reconciliation between ROE 
and Adjusted ROE is provided in Appendix A.

have performed better and in 2018 exceeded our 15%

We saw our adjusted return on equity expand due to 
higher interest rates, which increased earnings on our 
float substantially, nearly all of which drops to the 
bottom line. Slightly elevated volatility also drove 
more volume on our platform. In addition, we also 
saw strong underlying growth in our client footprint, 
as we added new accounts at a healthy rate and 
realized some market-share gains.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S LETTER

Intellectual Capital:
Target: 5 -10% organic growth in revenue 
producers.
We recognize that this is often a “quality-not-
quantity” metric. Our business is based on sticky, 
long term and meaningful value-added relationships 
with our clients. While we are increasingly looking 
to leverage our professional staff with appropriate 
technology to drive efficiencies, people and 
intellectual capital matter. Over the past 10 years, as 
we have grown our capabilities, it has become easier 
to attract the caliber of talent we need to drive our 
business. As always, we take a patient and persistent 
approach to attract people who think as we do and 
want to build a long-term client-centric business.

Efficiency in Driving Revenue Growth
Target: Minimum return per front office producer 
of $1 million per annum.
This is a key measure of our success in productivity 
and efficiency in driving revenue through use of 
technology as well as leveraging existing client 
relationships and expanding our products and 
capabilities. 

We have comfortably exceeded this target in 
recent years. The 2018 increase of 16% to $1.5 
million per annum average is reflective of better 
market conditions, as well as our progress on better 
leveraging our revenue producers with technology 
and better leveraging our growing capabilities into 
our client relationships. 

Efficient and Scalable Infrastructure
Target: Number of Revenue-producing staff is 
50% of total staff. 
To ensure that we keep an efficient and scalable 
infrastructure, we target that more than 50% of our 
employees should be client-facing and generating 
revenue. This forces us to control support and 
infrastructure costs and drive efficiencies with 
technology.

We have not consistently achieved this target for 
the better part of five years largely due to the high 
minimum infrastructure and operational costs related 
to the clearing, settlement and custody side of our 
business. We are working incrementally to address 
this in two ways: 1) better use of technology to reduce 
operational costs, and 2) achieving better scale on 
our clearing platform (especially securities) driving 
the operational leverage in this business. 

We saw a decrease in this metric from approximately 
43% in 2015 to 39% in 2017, when we acquired the 
Sterne Agee securities clearing operations. This 
clearing business was below scale and not covering 
its fixed costs when acquired. Subsequently, it 
has added more than 30 correspondent clearing 
relationships and is now both profitable and starting 
to realize operational leverage.

Flexible Cost Structure
Target: >50% of our total costs variable to 
revenue.
To compound our capital consistently, we need to 
ensure that we have a resilient business model with 
a highly flexible cost structure to protect our bottom 
line through the inherent cyclicality of the markets.

We do this by limiting fixed costs – especially fixed 
compensation, which represents our largest expense.

This target has been achieved for the last five years.

Compensation Ratio
Target: Ratio of total compensation to operating 
revenue less than 40%.
Compensation is our largest single expense and must 
be managed effectively. 

We adopt a transparent and flexible compensation 
model that limits fixed costs but rewards 
performance and puts us in a partnership 
arrangement with our key people. We believe that 
successful people in our industry are attracted to 
such arrangements. However, we also balance 
this approach with the need to ensure that overall 
compensation cost is proportional to the return 
shareholders require for supporting the costs, capital 
and risks associated with providing our platform.

Risk Metrics – De Minimis Directional Risk and 
Consistent Revenue
Target: consistently profitable daily revenue on 
a marked to market basis.
Our goal is to minimize the directional risk we take 
when acting as a principal to ensure that we take on 
limited risk and ensure stable, consistent revenues.

We seek to act as a facilitator to our clients in 
accessing the global trading markets and minimize 
taking direct market risk. In certain of our business 
activities, we act as a principal to facilitate client 
trade execution, and for such transactions, we seek to 
offset market risk through matched transactions and 
hedging, and limit as much as possible the length of 
our holding period. 

We monitor our success in mitigating market risk 
through proxies, which include analyzing the 
variance of daily trading profitability and bad debt 
exposure. Our daily trading profitability tends to 
follow a bell-curve distribution, which we believe 

Risk Metrics – Bad Debt Expense
Target: bad debt less than 1% of annual 
operating revenue.
As a clearer, we guarantee the performance of our 
clients to the exchanges and counterparties that 
they execute trades with, and as such, we assume 
counterparty risk. Our risk department calibrates our 
risk to ensure that, in a normal market environment, 
our client charge-offs are proportional to our capital 
and operating revenue, and also to ensure that in the 
times of severe market stress (Black Swans), we avoid 
catastrophic loss and are able to continue to function 
normally.

We fulfill an essential function within the market

sector continues. Our risk department reviews the 
creditworthiness of our clients and their ability 

to perform on their obligations, including making 
margin calls to cover negative market moves.

The chart above provides our annual charge offs 
and is empirical evidence of our risk management 
approach.

16 I 2018 ANNUAL REPORT

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
As outlined in the prior sections, we believe that we offer our clients an experience that is not available 
through other financial intermediaries. Clients receive superior execution services, including “one call” trader 
access and market intelligence traditionally provided only by large, diversified global banks. Our unique 
offering provides many of our clients with products and services that are often inaccessible to them due to 
their middle-market size, and that our competitors cannot offer due to a lack of size and scale. 

We believe that this combination creates strong and lasting client relationships and provides us with 
opportunities for revenue growth through cross-selling. Our deep relationships are evidenced by strong client 
growth in all business lines, including a net gain of more than 3,100 clients since 2017, and by our long-
standing client relationships. We employ a data-driven approach to consistently tailor our product offerings to 
the changing needs of our clients and continuously monitor the resources they use and activities they pursue.

Within this context, we achieved strong operating revenue growth of $191.8 million, for a total of $975.8 
million in fiscal 2018 – a 24% increase over the prior year. The return of some periods of volatility in our key 
markets resulted in increased client activity and a widening of spreads in fiscal 2018, which combined with 
increases in short-term interest rates and average client balances, resulted in record operating revenues in all 
five of our reporting segments.

Overall segment income increased 55%, with Commercial Hedging and Physical Commodities adding $23.6 
million and $48.0 million respectively. Clearing and Execution Services added $17.9 million, while our Global 
Payments segment added $9.2 million. These gains were modestly offset by a $5.8 million decline in Securities 
segment income.

Net income increased $49.1 million to $55.5 million in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017, primarily related 
to the growth in operating revenues as well as the reduction in bad debt related to the physical coal business. 
Net income in fiscal 2018 includes an estimated one-time income tax charge of $19.8 million related to the 
enactment of U.S. Tax Reform. This charge is related to the re-measurement of our deferred tax assets and 
liabilities arising from a lower U.S. corporate tax rate and shift to a territorial tax regime as well as a charge 
related to the deemed repatriation of unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Excluding the impact of Tax 
Reform, net income in fiscal 2018 would have been $75.3 million.(1) 

On the expense side, we continue to focus on maintaining our variable cost model and limiting the growth of 
our non-variable expenses. To that end, variable expenses were 61% of total expenses in fiscal 2018 compared 
to 53% in the prior year period. Non-variable expenses declined $30.7 million versus the prior year. However, 
excluding the bad debt on physical coal, non-variable expenses increased $15.3 million year-over-year or 5%.

PERFORMANCE BY CLIENT TYPE
Increasingly, our business is centered on commercial clients looking to hedge and mitigate financial risks 
inherent in their operating businesses, and on institutional clients looking to either invest or trade in the 
financial markets. In addition, we have our Global Payments platform, which is increasingly driven by banks 
and financial institutions, and in many ways is a technology-driven platform.

Commercial Clients
Through our Commercial Hedging and Physical Commodities segments, we provide our 7,000 to 10,000 
commercial clients globally with a high-value-added and high-touch service that we believe differentiates us 
from our competitors and maximizes the opportunity to retain them as clients. Our services are designed to 
quantify and monitor commercial entities’ exposure to commodity and financial risk, develop plans to control 
and hedge those risks, and provide post-trade reporting against specific client objectives. Our clients are 
assisted in the execution of their hedging strategies through a wide range of products, from listed exchange-

(1) A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP amounts shown is provided in Appendix A.

2018 ANNUAL REPORT I 17

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S LETTER

traded futures and options to basic OTC instruments that offer greater flexibility to structured OTC products 
that are customized to suit the client’s individual risk profile and needs. To our mid-sized clients, we offer 
structured products that are usually reserved for the largest clients of global banks, as well as high-touch risk 
management consulting traditionally associated with smaller boutiques. These clients include producers/
end-users, wholesalers and merchants, corporations, introducing brokers, grain elevators, merchandisers, and 
importers/exporters across many industries globally. 

Our services span a majority of traded commodity markets, with the largest concentrations in agricultural 
and energy commodities (consisting primarily of grains, energy and renewable fuels, coffee, sugar, cotton and 
food service), as well as in base and precious metals products. We also provide execution of foreign currency 
forwards and options and interest rate swaps, as well as a wide range of structured product solutions to our 
commercial clients that are seeking cost-effective hedging strategies. 

To further complement these capabilities, we also have a physical commodities capability in both metals and 
agricultural markets where we can, on a selective base, assist our clients in procuring or selling commodities 
or by-products, arrange logistics support and financing for these products, or embed risk management 
programs in physical contracts to enable our clients to bypass the accounting complexities involved in using 
derivatives. 

This set of exchange-listed, OTC and structured products, combined with our physical capabilities, is 
unmatched by our competitors, and we are seeing more extensive use of these capabilities by our commercial 
clients. Again, this creates the kind of “sticky” relationships that are 1) more meaningful for our clients, as we 
can solve most, if not all, of their hedging requirements, and 2) more valuable to us, as they create annuity-
type revenue streams.

While our offering to these commercial clients is “high touch,” with a relatively large education and advisory 
component, we are developing the technology to do this more efficiently and thus better leverage the 
experience and expertise of our brokers. For example, we are looking to launch a digitized interface for all 
of our clients, giving them a 360-degree view of all of their touchpoints with our organization. At the same 
time, this interface will give our brokers the entire integrated view of a client’s relationship with us. We have 
already digitized our market intelligence offering, which allows us to track the usefulness of each individual 
report, as well as identify potential marketing leads from reader patterns.

During 2018, we launched a platform that enables clients to build structured products online from a set of 
building blocks, and simulate outcomes to potentially determine the most suitable combination of products 
relative to their needs, all with live pricing. Our precious metals business offers an industry-leading trading 
platform that is driving volumes, as well as a first-in-industry online platform for physical trading of gold and 
other precious metals. This platform prices available metal to desired locations and currency – inclusive of 
foreign exchange and logistics costs. All of these tools are customized to meet client needs and to provide 
them with greater convenience and added value. 

Aggregate net operating revenue from our commercial clients in fiscal 2018 was $271.2 million (Commercial 
Hedging - $226.4 and Physical Commodities - $44.8). This aggregate revenue was up 17% for the year and 
constituted approximately 47% of total net operating revenue.

Aggregate net segment income from our commercial clients in fiscal 2018 was $113 million (Commercial 
Hedging - $96.4 million and Physical Commodities - $16.6 million) and constituted approximately 43% of total 
net segment income.

Institutional Clients
Through our Securities and Clearing and Execution Services segments, we service our global institutional 
clients by providing liquidity and trade execution, as well as electronic access (through a wide variety of 
technology platforms) to a number of important global markets. These include more than 40 derivatives 
exchanges and most global securities exchanges, as well as a variety of global execution facilities and 
liquidity sources. Our clients include professional traders, funds, institutional money managers, commercial 
bank trust and investment departments, broker-dealers, insurance companies, introducing broker dealers and 
their clients. 

Asset and product types include listed futures and options on futures, equities, mutual funds, equity options, 
corporate, government and municipal bonds and unit investment trusts. We believe we are one of the leading 
market makers in foreign securities, as we make markets in more than 5,000 ADRs, GDRs and foreign ordinary 
shares – of which 3,600-plus trade in the OTC markets. In addition, we will, on request, make prices in more 
than 10,000 unlisted foreign securities. We provide value-added solutions that facilitate cross-border trading 
and believe our clients value our ability to manage complex transactions, including foreign exchange, utilizing 
our understanding of local market convention, liquidity and settlement protocols around the world. 

We act as an institutional dealer in fixed income securities, including United States Treasury, United States 
government agency, agency mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities. We are also a broker-dealer in 
Argentina, where we are active in providing institutional execution in the local capital markets. Through our 
London-based Europe, Middle East and Africa oil voice brokerage business, we provide brokerage services 
across the fuel, crude and middle distillates markets to more than 200 commercial and institutional clients 
throughout these regions.

We also originate, structure and place debt instruments in the international and domestic capital markets. 
These instruments include complex asset-backed securities (primarily in Argentina) and domestic municipal 
securities. We also actively trade in a variety of international debt instruments, as well as operate an asset 
management business.

As part of our integrated offering, we provide competitive and efficient clearing on major futures and 
securities exchanges globally, as well as prime brokerage in major foreign currency pairs and swap 
transactions. Additionally, we provide clearing of foreign exchange transactions, in addition to clearing of a 
wide range of OTC products.

Over the last three years, we have significantly expanded our institutional capabilities and client footprint 
via some key strategic acquisitions. Our acquisition of Sterne Agee’s Correspondent Clearing and Wealth 
Management businesses added correspondent securities clearing and wealth management capabilities 
to our product and service offering. The acquisition of G.X. Clarke & Co., an institutional dealer in United 
States government securities, federal agency and mortgage-backed securities, helped deepen relationships 
with approximately 650 institutional accounts. More recently, our 2018 acquisition of Carl Kliem S.A., a 
Luxembourg-based and EU-regulated inter-dealer broker with more than 400 institutional relationships, 
expands our institutional market coverage in Europe. We also increased our offering with the purchase of U.S-
based broker-dealer GMP Securities LLC (formerly Miller Tabak Roberts), which adds new products and more 
than 2,400 institutional relationships. 

Finally, during late 2018, we started an agency execution business in U.S. equities – a significant market where 
we have little presence but some name recognition as a result of our leading position as a market-maker in 
foreign securities. We have been recruiting experienced people with deep institutional relationships who would 
be able to leverage our expertise and name recognition. We also have started to leverage our clearing and 
custody capabilities into a prime brokerage capability for hedge funds, which is a new client segment for us.

2018 ANNUAL REPORT I 19

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S LETTER

Aggregate net operating revenue from our institutional clients in fiscal 2018 was $217.2 million (Clearing and 
Execution - $122.6 million and Securities - $94.6 million). This aggregate revenue was up 10% for the year and 
constituted approximately 37% of total net operating revenue.

Aggregate net segment income from our institutional clients in fiscal 2018 was $89.1 million (Clearing and 
Execution - $48.3 million and Securities - $40.8 million). This aggregate segment income was up 16% for the 
year and constituted around 34% of total segment income.

Global Payments
We provide global payment solutions to banks and commercial businesses, as well as charities and both 
government and nongovernmental organizations, or NGOs. We offer competitive and transparent pricing in 
approximately 140 currencies, which we believe is more than any other payments solution provider. 

Our proprietary FXecute global payments platform is integrated with a financial information exchange (“FIX”) 
protocol. This FIX protocol is an electronic communication method for the real-time exchange of information, 
and we believe it represents one of the first FIX offerings for cross-border payments in non-G20 currencies. FIX 
functionality allows clients to view real-time market rates for various currencies, execute and manage orders 
in real-time, and view the status of their payments through an easy-to-use portal. Additionally, as a member of 
the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (“SWIFT”), we are able to offer our services 
to large money centers and global banks seeking more competitive international payments services. 

Three factors have opened opportunities for competitors in this market: 1) the general lack of transparency in 
bank offerings in the global payments market with regard to fees and exchange rates, 2) the banks’ often more 
expensive services, and 3) the lack of systematic regulation in and across destination countries. We believe 
that we are a disrupter here, offering significant value to our bank, corporate and NGO/charities clients by 
providing competitive and transparent payments solutions (in particular to non-G20 currencies) through an 
efficient technology platform.

During 2018, we upgraded our regulatory status in Brazil and now have a fully-fledged domestic payments 
capability handling both in-bound and out-bound payments. This is one of the major payments corridors 
globally, and we saw an immediate and noticeable uptick in the volume and size of in-bound payments. Over 
the medium term, we hope to see the same for out-bound payments.

Increasing globalization and the growth of international trade, as well as the need of corporations, 
institutions, and individuals to move money across borders efficiently, have driven growing activity in the 
global payments industry. Volume growth in the global payments market has been steady, driving revenue 
growth for cross-border payments providers. Increasingly, this volume growth comes from transactions to 
emerging economies, benefiting those few providers (such as us) that have a strong competitive position 
in those emerging economies and an extensive correspondent bank network, which would be difficult to 
replicate. 

Net operating revenue from our Global Payments business was $93.5 million, up 16% for the year and 
constituted approximately 16% of total net operating revenue.

Net segment income was $59.8 million, up 18% for the year and constituted around 23% of total segment 
income.

LOOKING AHEAD
Our core business performed well during 2018, as better market conditions unleashed the true earnings power 
of our business model. Our return on equity was 11.6%. When adjusted for the impact of U.S. Tax Reform, it was 
16.0%(1), which is above our long-term target and a best-in-class performance, in our estimation. 

(1) A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP amounts shown is provided in Appendix A.

20 I 2018 ANNUAL REPORT

We plan to continue to leverage our unique “all-through-one” business model and product offering, as we 
believe it will continue to draw clients to our platform as industry consolidation continues, as well as enable 
us to create deep client relationships, grow client balances, and increase clearing and execution revenues.

We continue to see gains in market share and attract new clients that are underserved by the global banks, 
capitalizing on our position as one of the few publicly listed mid-sized financial services companies that offers 
clients futures and options products through our well-capitalized independent FCM, structured products 
through our swaps dealer, and securities through our broker-dealer division. 

Management’s priority is to remain laser-focused on our goal of becoming a best-in-class financial franchise 
by relentlessly pursuing the following objectives: 

•  Adding products and capabilities, either organically or through disciplined acquisition, to make us a 

counterparty of choice for commercial and institutional clients looking to access markets with efficient 
execution as well as post trade clearing, settlement and custody services.

•  Expanding into client segments and geographies where we are under-represented, by acquiring suitable 

talent through recruitment or disciplined acquisition of teams. 

•  More tightly integrating our offerings, platforms, marketing strategy and customer experience in order to 

make the relationship more meaningful for the customer, “stickier” for the company, and more valuable to 
us both.

• 

Investing in client-facing technology – through an efficient mix of proprietary and industry-standard 
platforms to better leverage our intellectual capital in driving revenue growth and providing customers 
easier and more efficient access to our products and services 

•  Create a scalable execution and clearing infrastructure where costs per transaction are decreasing in 

absolute terms.

•  Robust environment to dynamically allocate capital and resources to create maximum long-term value for 

shareholders.

•  Multi-layered risk management to ensure that we achieve the best risk-adjusted return for our business.

We believe that we have made significant strides over the last couple years, as evidenced by our financial 
performance, and have becoming increasingly recognized as a broker and counterparty of choice globally.  
We are well positioned and excited about the prospects ahead. 

On behalf of the executive management team, I want to firstly and most importantly thank all of our clients 
for without you we have no business; we know we have to earn your trust every day by adding value to your 
business. Thanks also to everyone on our amazing INTL FCStone team for their exceptional contributions 
during this productive year, our Board and advisors for their guidance, our bankers for their financial support, 
and our stockholders for entrusting their capital to us.

APPENDIX A

The tables below present net income and diluted earnings per share as reported in accordance with Generally Accepted 
Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). The tables below also present reconciliations to adjusted net income, adjusted diluted 
earnings per share and adjusted ROE, which are non-GAAP measures.

The adjusted non-GAAP amounts reflect each item after removing the impacts of Tax Reform for the year ended 
September 30, 2018 and the bad debt on physical coal, net of incentive recapture for the years ended September 30, 2017 
and 2018. Management believes that presenting our results excluding Tax Reform and the bad debt on physical coal, net 
of incentive recapture is meaningful, as it increases the comparability of period-to-period results.

Cautionary Statement about Forward-Looking Statements

Certain statements in this report, other than purely historical 
information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to 
our business plans, objectives and expected operating results, and the 
assumptions upon which those statements are based, are “forward-
looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities 
Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act 
of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and 

assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause 
actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. 
A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that 
could cause actual results and events to differ materially from such 
forward-looking statements is included in the section entitled “Risk 
Factors” (refer to Part I, Item 1A). We undertake no obligation to 
update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as 
a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Overview of Business and Strategy

We are a diversified global brokerage and financial services firm 
providing execution, risk management and advisory services, market 
intelligence and clearing services with significant asset class coverage 
and significant market coverage globally. We help our clients to access 
market liquidity, maximize profits and manage risk. Our revenues are 
derived primarily from financial products and advisory services intended 
to fulfill our clients’ commercial needs and provide bottom-line 
benefits to their businesses. Our businesses are supported by our 
global infrastructure of regulated operating subsidiaries, our advanced 
technology platform and our team of more than 1,700 employees as of 
September 30, 2018. We believe our client-first approach differentiates 
us from large banking institutions, engenders trust and has enabled 
us to establish leadership positions in a number of complex fields in 
financial markets around the world.
We offer a vertically integrated product suite, including high-touch 
execution, electronic access through a wide variety of technology 
platforms in a number of important global markets, and insightful 
market intelligence and advice, as well as post-trade settlement, clearing 
and custody services. We believe this is a unique product suite offering 
outside of bulge bracket banks, which creates sticky relationships with 
our clients. Our business model has created a revenue stream that is 
diversified by asset class, client type and geography, with a significant 
portion of recurring revenue derived from monetizing non-trading 
client activity including consistent and predictable interest and fee 
earnings on client balances, while also earning both commissions and 
spreads as clients execute transactions across our financial network.
We currently serve more than 20,000 commercial and institutional 
clients, located in more than 130 countries. We believe we are the 
third largest independent, non-bank futures commission merchant 
(“FCM”) in the United States (“U.S.”) based upon our approximately 
$2.6 billion in client segregated assets as of September 30, 2018, and 
one of the top ranked market makers in foreign securities by dollar 
volume as determined through the three-year period ended December 
31, 2017, making markets in approximately 5,000 different foreign 
securities. We are one of only nine Category One ring dealing members 
of the London Metals Exchange (the “LME”). Our clients include 
commercial entities, asset managers, regional, national and introducing 
broker-dealers, insurance companies, brokers, institutional investors and 
professional traders, commercial and investment banks and government 
and non-governmental organizations (“NGOs”). We believe our clients 

2

value us for our attention to their needs, our expertise and flexibility, 
our global reach, our ability to provide access to liquidity in hard to 
reach markets and opportunities, and our status as a well-capitalized 
and regulatory-compliant organization. Our correspondent clearing 
and independent wealth management businesses include approximately 
60 correspondent clearing relationships representing more than 80,000 
underlying individual securities accounts as of September 30, 2018.
We engage in direct sales efforts to seek new clients, with a strategy 
of extending our services to potential clients that are similar in size 
and operations to our existing client base. In executing this strategy, 
we intend to both target new geographic locations and expand the 
services offered in geographic locations in which we currently operate 
where there is an unmet need for our services, particularly in those 
locations where commodity price controls have been recently lifted. 
In addition, we selectively pursue small- to medium-sized acquisitions, 
focusing primarily on targets that satisfy specified criteria, including 
client-centric organizations that may help us expand into new asset 
classes, client segments and geographies where we currently have 
small or limited market presence.
We believe we are well positioned to capitalize on key trends impacting 
the financial services sector. Among others, these trends include the 
impact of increased regulation on banking institutions and other 
financial services providers; increased consolidation, especially of 
smaller sub-scale financial services providers and independent securities 
clearing firms; the growing importance and complexity of conducting 
secure cross-border transactions; and the demand among financial 
institutions to transact with well-capitalized counterparties.
We focus on mitigating exposure to market risk, ensuring adequate 
liquidity to maintain our daily operations and making non-interest 
expenses variable, to the greatest extent possible. Our strategy is to 
utilize a centralized and disciplined process for capital allocation, risk 
management and cost control, while delegating the execution of strategic 
objectives and day-to-day management to experienced individuals. This 
requires high quality managers, a clear communication of performance 
objectives and strong financial and compliance controls. We believe 
this strategy will enable us to build a more scalable and significantly 
larger organization that embraces an entrepreneurial approach to 
business, supported and underpinned by strong centralized financial 
and compliance controls.
INTL FCStone Inc. is a Delaware corporation formed in October 1987.

Capabilities

We provide our clients access to financial markets and liquidity sources 
globally to enable them to efficiently hedge their risk and/or gain 
exposure. Our financial network connects over 20,000 commercial 
and institutional clients and over 80,000 retail clients to 36 derivatives 
exchanges, most global securities exchanges and a multitude of bilateral 
liquidity sources.

Execution
We provide high-touch execution as well as electronic access through 
a wide variety of technology platforms in a number of important 
global markets. Asset and product types include listed futures and 
options on futures, equities, mutual funds, equity options, corporate, 
government and municipal bonds and unit investment trusts.

Clearing
We provide competitive and efficient clearing on major futures and 
securities exchanges globally, as well as prime brokerage in major 
foreign currency pairs and swap transactions. Additionally, we provide 
clearing of foreign exchange transactions, in addition to clearing of a 
wide range of over-the-counter “(OTC”) products.

Global Payments
We have built a scalable platform to provide end-to-end global 
payment solutions to banks and commercial businesses, as well as 
charities, NGOs and government organizations. We offer payments 
services in approximately 140 currencies. In this business, we 
primarily act as a principal in buying and selling foreign currencies 
on a spot basis deriving revenue from the difference between the 
purchase and sale prices. Through our comprehensive platform 
and our commitment to client service, we provide simple and 
fast execution, delivering funds in any of these countries quickly 
through our global network of more than 300 correspondent 
banking relationships.

Advisory Services
We provide value-added advisory services and high-touch trade 
execution across a variety of financial markets, including commodities, 
foreign currencies, interest rates, institutional asset management 
and independent wealth management. For commercial clients with 

exposure to commodities, foreign currencies and interest rates, we 
work through our proprietary Integrated Risk Management Program 
(“IRMP®”) to systematically identify and quantify their risks and 
then develop strategic plans to effectively manage these risks with 
a view to protecting their margins and ultimately improving their 
bottom lines.
We also participate in the underwriting and trading of municipal 
securities in domestic markets as well as asset-backed securities in our 
Argentinian operations. Through our asset management activities, 
we leverage our specialist expertise in niche markets to provide 
institutional investors with tailored investment products. Through 
our independent wealth management business, we provide advisory 
services to the growing retail investor market.

Physical Trading
We act as a principal to support the needs of our clients in a variety of 
physical commodities, primarily precious metals, as well as across the 
commodity complex, including energy commodities, grains, oil seeds, 
cotton, coffee, cocoa, edible oils and feed products. Through these 
activities, we have the ability to offer a simplified risk management 
approach to our commercial clients by embedding more complex 
hedging structures as part of each physical contract to provide clients 
with enhanced price risk mitigation. We also offer clients efficient 
off-take or supply services, as well as logistics management.

OTC / Market-Making
We offer clients access to the OTC markets for a broad range of traded 
commodities, foreign currencies and interest rates, as well as to global 
securities markets. For clients with commodity price and financial 
risk, our customized and tailored OTC structures help mitigate those 
risks by integrating the processes of product design, execution of the 
underlying components of the structured risk product, transaction 
reporting and valuation.
We provide market-making and execution in a variety of financial 
products including commodity derivatives, unlisted American 
Depository Receipts (“ADRs”) and Global Depository Receipts 
(“GDRs”), foreign ordinary shares, and foreign currencies. In addition, 
we are an institutional dealer in fixed income securities including 
U.S. Treasury, U.S. government agency, agency mortgage-backed, 
asset-backed and corporate securities.

consultants, providing a high-value-added service that we believe 
differentiates us from our competitors and maximizes the opportunity 
to retain our clients. Our risk management consulting services are 
designed to quantify and monitor commercial entities’ exposure 
to commodity and financial risk. Upon assessing this exposure, 
we develop a plan to control and hedge these risks with post-trade 
reporting against specific client objectives. Our clients are assisted 
in the execution of their hedging strategies through a wide range of 
products from listed exchange-traded futures and options, to basic 
OTC instruments that offer greater flexibility and structured OTC 
products designed for customized solutions.
Our services span virtually all traded commodity markets, with 
the largest concentrations in agricultural and energy commodities 
(consisting primarily of grains, energy and renewable fuels, coffee, 
sugar, cotton, and food service) and base metals products listed on 
the LME. Our base metals business includes a position as a Category 
One ring dealing member of the LME, providing execution, clearing 
and advisory services in exchange-traded futures and OTC products. 
We also provide execution of foreign currency forwards and options 
and interest rate swaps as well as a wide range of structured product 
solutions to our commercial clients who are seeking cost-effective 
hedging strategies. Generally, our clients direct their own trading 
activity, and our risk management consultants do not have discretionary 
authority to transact trades on behalf of our clients.
Within this segment, our risk management consultants organize their 
marketing efforts into client industry product lines, and currently 
serve clients in the following areas:
•• Financial Agricultural (“Ag”) & Energy
•– Agricultural —

•■ Grain elevator operators, grain merchandisers, traders, processors, 

manufacturers and end-users.

Physical Commodities
This segment consists of our physical Precious Metals trading and Physical 
Agricultural (“Ag”) and Energy commodity businesses. In Precious 
Metals, we provide a full range of trading and hedging capabilities, 
including OTC products, to select producers, consumers, and investors. 
In our trading activities, we act as a principal, committing our own 
capital to buy and sell precious metals on a spot and forward basis.
In our Physical Ag & Energy commodity business, we act as a principal 
to facilitate financing, structured pricing and logistics services to 
clients across the commodity complex, including energy commodities, 
grains, oil seeds, cotton, coffee, cocoa, edible oils and feed products. 
We provide financing to commercial commodity-related companies 
against physical inventories. We use sale and repurchase agreements 
to purchase commodities evidenced by warehouse receipts, subject 
to a simultaneous agreement to sell such commodities back to the 
original seller at a later date.
We generally mitigate the price risk associated with commodities 
held in inventory through the use of derivatives. We do not elect 
hedge accounting under accounting principles generally accepted in 
the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) in accounting for this 
price risk mitigation.

Institutional Client Focused Segments

Clearing and Execution Services (“CES”)
We provide competitive and efficient clearing and execution in all major 
futures and securities exchanges globally as well as prime brokerage 
in major foreign currency pairs and swap transactions. Through our 
platform, client orders are accepted and directed to the appropriate 
exchange for execution. We then facilitate the clearing of clients’ 
transactions. Clearing involves the matching of client’ trades with the 
exchange, the collection and management of client margin deposits 
to support the transactions, and the accounting and reporting of the 
transactions to clients.

                                 - Form 10-KAs of September 30, 2018, we held $2.6 billion in required client 
segregated assets, which we believe makes us the third largest non-bank 
FCM in the U.S., as measured by required client segregated assets. 
We seek to leverage our capabilities and capacity by offering facilities 
management or outsourcing solutions to other FCM’s.
We are an independent full-service provider to introducing broker-
dealers (“IBD’s”) of clearing, custody, research, syndicated and 
security-based lending products and services, including a proprietary 
technology platform which offers seamless connectivity to ensure 
a positive client experience through the clearing and settlement 
process. Our independent wealth management business, which 
offers a comprehensive product suite to retail clients nationwide, 
clears through this platform. We believe we are one of the leading 
mid-market clearers in the securities industry, with approximately 
60 correspondent clearing relationships with over $15 billion in assets 
under management or administration as of September 30, 2018.
Within this segment, we also maintain what we believe is one of 
the largest non-bank prime brokers and swap dealers in the world. 
Through this offering, we provide prime brokerage foreign exchange 
(“FX”) services to financial institutions and professional traders. We 
provide our clients with the full range of OTC products, including 
24-hour a day execution of spot, forwards and options as well as 
non-deliverable forwards in both liquid and exotic currencies. We 
also operate a proprietary FX desk that arbitrages the exchange-traded 
foreign exchange markets with the cash markets.
Through our London-based Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) 
oil voice brokerage business, we employ over 30 employees providing 
brokerage services across the fuel, crude and middle distillates markets 
with over 200 commercial and institutional clients throughout Europe, 
the Middle East and Africa.

Securities
We provide value-added solutions that facilitate cross-border 
trading and believe our clients value our ability to manage 
complex transactions, including foreign exchange, utilizing our 
local understanding of market convention, liquidity and settlement 
protocols around the world. Our clients include U.S.-based regional 
and national broker-dealers and institutions investing or executing 
client transactions in international markets and foreign institutions 
seeking access to the U.S. securities markets. We are one of the 
leading market makers in foreign securities, including unlisted 
ADRs, GDRs and foreign ordinary shares. We make markets in 
over 5,000 ADRs, GDRs and foreign ordinary shares, of which over 
3,600 trade in the OTC market. In addition, we will, on request, 
make prices in more than 10,000 unlisted foreign securities. We are 
also a broker-dealer in Argentina where we are active in providing 
institutional executions in the local capital markets.

PART I 
ITEM 1 Business

We act as an institutional dealer in fixed income securities, including 
U.S. Treasury, U.S. government agency, agency mortgage-backed 
and asset-backed securities to a client base including asset managers, 
commercial bank trust and investment departments, broker-dealers 
and insurance companies.
We originate, structure and place debt instruments in the international 
and domestic capital markets. These instruments include complex 
asset-backed securities (primarily in Argentina) and domestic 
municipal securities. On occasion, we may invest our own capital 
in debt instruments before selling them. We also actively trade in a 
variety of international debt instruments as well as operate an asset 
management business in which we earn fees, commissions and other 
revenues for management of third party assets and investment gains 
or losses on our investments in funds and proprietary accounts 
managed either by our investment managers or by independent 
investment managers.

Payments Segment

Global Payments
We provide global payment solutions to banks and commercial 
businesses as well as charities and non-governmental and government 
organizations. We offer payments services in approximately 170 countries 
and 140 currencies, which we believe is more than any other payments 
solution provider, and provide transparent pricing.
Our proprietary FXecute global payments platform is integrated with 
a financial information exchange (“FIX”) protocol. This FIX protocol 
is an electronic communication method for the real-time exchange of 
information, and we believe it represents one of the first FIX offerings 
for cross-border payments in exotic currencies. FIX functionality 
allows clients to view real time market rates for various currencies, 
execute and manage orders in real-time, and view the status of their 
payments through the easy-to-use portal.
Additionally, as a member of the Society for Worldwide Interbank 
Financial Telecommunication (“SWIFT”), we are able to offer 
our services to large money center and global banks seeking more 
competitive international payments services.
Through this single comprehensive platform and our commitment 
to client service, we believe we are able to provide simple and fast 
execution, ensuring delivery of funds in any of these countries quickly 
through our global network of approximately 300 correspondent 
banks. In this business, we primarily act as a principal in buying and 
selling foreign currencies on a spot basis. We derive revenue from the 
difference between the purchase and sale prices.
We believe our clients value our ability to provide exchange rates 
that are significantly more competitive than those offered by large 
international banks, a competitive advantage that stems from our 
years of foreign exchange expertise focused on smaller, less liquid 
currencies.

Acquisitions during Fiscal Year 2018

PayCommerce Financial Solutions, LLC
On September 5, 2018, we acquired all of the outstanding membership 
interests of PayCommerce Financial Solutions, LLC. PayCommerce 
Financial Solutions, LLC is a fully accredited SWIFT Service Bureau 
provider. The acquisition enables us to act as a SWIFT Service Bureau for 
our 300-plus correspondent banking network, thus providing another 
important service for delivering local currency, cross-border payments 
to the developing world. The purchase price was approximately $3.8 
million and was not material to us. Subsequent to the acquisition, 
we have renamed PayCommerce Financial Solutions, LLC to INTL 
Technology Services LLC.

Carl Kliem S.A.
On June 12, 2018, we executed a sale and purchase agreement to 
acquire Carl Kliem S.A. Carl Kliem S.A. is an independent interdealer 
broker based in Luxembourg, a leading European financial hub, 
providing foreign exchange, interest rate and fixed income products 
to a diverse, institutional client base across the European Union. Carl 
Kliem S.A. employs approximately 40 people and has over 400 active 
institutional clients. The closing of the agreement was conditional upon 
approval of the Luxembourg financial sector supervisory authority, 
the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (“CSSF”). In 
November 2018, the Company received regulatory approval from the 
CSSF to complete the acquisition. The purchase price is equal to the 
net tangible book value on the completion date minus restructuring 
costs and is not expected to be material to us.

Acquisition and Internal Subsidiary Consolidation during Fiscal Year 2017

ICAP’s EMEA Oils Broking Business
Effective October 1, 2016, our wholly owned subsidiary, INTL FCStone 
Ltd (“IFL”), acquired the London-based EMEA oils business of ICAP 
plc. The business included more than 30 front office employees across 
the fuel, crude, middle distillates, futures and options desks that have 
relationships with over 200 commercial and institutional clients 
throughout Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The purchase price 
included cash consideration of $6.0 million paid directly to ICAP as 
well as incentive amounts payable to employees acquired based upon 
their continued employment.

Acquisition during Fiscal Year 2016

Internal Subsidiary Consolidation
Effective July 1, 2017, we merged our wholly-owned regulated 
U.S. subsidiary, Sterne Agee & Leach, Inc., into our wholly 
owned regulated U.S. subsidiary, INTL FCStone Financial Inc. 
(“INTL FCStone Financial”), which is registered as both a broker-
dealer and a FCM. As such, the assets, liabilities and equity of Sterne 
Agee & Leach, Inc. were transferred into INTL FCStone Financial.

Sterne Agee
Effective July 1, 2016, we acquired the legacy independent brokerage and 
clearing businesses of Sterne Agee, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of 
Stifel Financial Corp. Effective August 1, 2016, we acquired the legacy 
Registered Investment Advisor (“RIA”) business of Sterne Agee, LLC. 
Pursuant to the two stock purchase agreements, we acquired Sterne 
Agee & Leach, Inc.; Sterne Agee Clearing, Inc.; Sterne Agee Financial 

Services, Inc.; Sterne Agee Asset Management, Inc. and Sterne Agee 
Investment Advisor Services, Inc. for cash consideration. The purchase 
price of $45.0 million represents a discount to the allocation of fair 
value to the net assets of the Sterne entities acquired. The $6.2 million 
discount in the purchase price compared to the allocation of fair value 
to the net assets at closing was reflected as a bargain purchase gain 
on the transaction within “other gains” in the Consolidated Income 
Statement for the year ended September 30, 2016.

Competition

The international commodities and financial markets are highly 
competitive and rapidly evolving. In addition, these markets are 
dominated by firms with significant capital and personnel resources 
that are not matched by our resources. We expect these competitive 
conditions to continue in the future, although the nature of the 
competition may change as a result of ongoing changes in the regulatory 
environment. We believe that we can compete successfully with other 

commodities and financial intermediaries in the markets we seek to 
serve, based on our expertise, products and quality of consulting and 
execution services.
We compete with a large number of firms in the exchange-traded 
futures and options on futures execution sector and in the OTC 
derivatives sector. We compete primarily on the basis of diversity 

6

                                 - Form 10-KPART I 
ITEM 1 Business

and value of services offered, and to a lesser extent on price. Our 
competitors in the exchange-traded futures and options sector include 
international, national and regional brokerage firms as well as local 
introducing brokers, with competition driven by price level and 
quality of service. Many of these competitors also offer OTC trading 
programs. In addition, there are a number of financial firms and 
physical commodities firms that participate in the OTC markets, 
both directly in competition with us and indirectly through firms 
like us. We compete in the OTC market by making specialized OTC 
transactions available to our clients in contract sizes that are smaller 
than those usually available from major counterparties.

Investor interest in the markets we serve impact and will continue 
to impact our activities. The instruments traded in these markets 
compete with a wide range of alternative investment instruments. 
We seek to counterbalance changes in demand in specified markets 
by undertaking activities in multiple uncorrelated markets.
Technology has increased competitive pressures on commodities and 
financial intermediaries by improving dissemination of information, 
making markets more transparent and facilitating the development of 
alternative execution mechanisms. In certain instances, we compete by 
providing technology-based solutions to facilitate client transactions 
and solidify client relationships.

Administration and Operations

We employ operations personnel to supervise and, for certain products, 
complete the clearing and settlement of transactions.
INTL FCStone Financial is a self-clearing broker-dealer which holds 
client funds and maintains deposits with the National Securities 
Clearing Corporation, Inc. (“NSCC”), MBS Clearing Corporation, 
Inc., Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, Inc. (“DTCC”) and 
the Options Clearing Corporation (“OCC”). In addition, it clears 
a portion of its securities transactions through Broadcort, a division 
of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc and Pershing LLC, a 
subsidiary of The Bank of New York Mellon.
INTL FCStone DTVM Ltda., our broker-dealer subsidiary based 
in Brazil, clears its securities transactions through BM&F Bovespa.
We utilize front-end electronic trading, back office and accounting 
systems to process transactions on a daily basis. In some cases these 

systems are integrated. The systems provide record keeping, trade 
reporting to exchange clearing organizations, internal risk controls, and 
reporting to government and regulatory entities, corporate managers, 
risk managers and clients. A third-party service bureau located in 
Hopkins, MN maintains our futures and options back office system. 
It has a disaster recovery site in Salem, NH.
We hold client funds in relation to certain of our activities. In regulated 
entities, these client funds are segregated, but in unregulated entities 
they are not. For a further discussion of client segregated funds 
in our regulated entities, please see the “Client Segregated Assets” 
discussion below.
Our administrative staff manages our internal financial controls, 
accounting functions, office services and compliance with regulatory 
requirements.

Governmental Regulation and Exchange Membership

Our activities are subject to significant governmental regulation, 
both in the U.S. and overseas. Failure to comply with regulatory 
requirements could result in administrative or court proceedings, 
censure, fines, issuance of cease-and-desist orders, or suspension or 
disqualification of the regulated entity, its officers, supervisors or 
representatives. The regulatory environment in which we operate 
is subject to frequent change and these changes directly impact our 
business and operating results.
The commodities industry in the U.S. is subject to extensive regulation 
under federal law. We are required to comply with a wide range of 
requirements imposed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission 
(the “CFTC”), the National Futures Association (the “NFA”) and the 
Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which is our designated self-regulatory 
organization. We are also a member of the Chicago Mercantile 
Exchange’s divisions: the Chicago Board of Trade, the New York 
Mercantile Exchange and COMEX, InterContinental Exchange, Inc. 
(“ICE”) Futures US, ICE Europe Ltd, the New Zealand Exchange 
and the Minneapolis Grain Exchange. These regulatory bodies protect 
clients by imposing requirements relating to capital adequacy, licensing 
of personnel, conduct of business, protection of client assets, record-
keeping, trade-reporting and other matters.

The securities industry in the U.S. is subject to extensive regulation 
under federal and state securities laws. We must comply with a wide 
range of requirements imposed by the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (the “SEC”), state securities commissions, the Municipal 
Securities Rulemaking Board (“MSRB”) and FINRA. These regulatory 
bodies safeguard the integrity of the financial markets and protect the 
interests of investors in these markets. They also impose minimum 
capital requirements on regulated entities. In connection with our 
wealth management business, one of our subsidiaries, SA Stone 
Investment Advisors Inc., is registered with, and subject to oversight 
by, the SEC as an investment adviser. As such, in its relations with its 
advisory clients, SA Stone Investment Advisers Inc. is subject to the 
fiduciary and other obligations imposed on investment advisers under 
the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the rules and regulations 
promulgated thereunder, as well as various state securities laws. These 
laws and regulations include obligations relating to, among other 
things, custody and management of client assets, marketing activities, 
self-dealing and full disclosure of material conflicts of interest, and 
generally grant the SEC and other supervisory bodies administrative 
powers to address non-compliance. Failure to comply with these 
requirements could result in a variety of sanctions, including, but not 
limited to, revocation of an advisory firm’s registration, restrictions or

limitations on its ability to carry on its investment advisory business 
or the types of clients with which it can deal, suspensions of individual 
employees and significant fines.
The Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”), the regulator of the financial 
services industry in the United Kingdom, regulates our subsidiary, 
INTL FCStone Ltd, as a Markets in Financial Instruments Directive 
(“MIFID”) investment firm under part IV of the Financial Services 
and Markets Act 2000. The regulations impose regulatory capital, as 
well as conduct of business, governance, and other requirements. The 
conduct of business rules include those that govern the treatment of 
client money and other assets which, under certain circumstances 
for certain classes of clients must be segregated from the firm’s own 
assets. INTL FCStone Ltd is a member of the LME, ICE Europe 
Ltd, Euronext Amsterdam, Euronext Paris, the European Energy 
Exchange, Eurex and Norexco ASA.
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 
(the “Dodd-Frank Act”) created a comprehensive new regulatory regime 
governing swaps and further regulations on listed derivatives. The 
Dodd-Frank Act also created a registration regime for new categories 
of market participants, such as “swap dealers”, among others. Our 
wholly owned subsidiary, INTL FCStone Markets, LLC is a CFTC 
provisionally registered swap dealer, whose business is overseen by the 
National Futures Association (“NFA”), the self-regulatory organization 
for the U.S. derivatives industry.
The Dodd-Frank Act generally introduced a framework for (i) swap data 
reporting and record keeping on counterparties and data repositories; 
(ii) centralized clearing for swaps, with limited exceptions for end-users; 
(iii) the requirement to execute swaps on regulated swap execution 
facilities; (iv) imposition on swap dealers to exchange margin on 
uncleared swaps with counterparties; and (v) the requirement to 
comply with new capital rules.
Effective September 2016, CFTC margin rules came into effect, 
imposing new requirements on registered swap dealers (such as our 
subsidiary, INTL FCStone Markets, LLC) and certain counterparties 
to exchange initial and variation margin, with an implementation 
period ending in 2020.  We will continue to monitor all applicable 
developments in the ongoing implementation of the Dodd-Frank 
Act. The legislation and implementing regulations affect not only 
us, but also our clients and counterparties.
The European Markets Infrastructure Regulation (“EMIR”) is the 
European regulations on OTC derivatives, central counterparties 
and trade repositories.  The EMIR has been implemented across 
the European Economic Area member states. EMIR has imposed 

Net Capital Requirements

new requirements on our European entities, including (a) reporting 
derivatives trades to trade repositories; (b) setting up enhanced 
risk management procedures for OTC derivative transactions; and 
(c) changes to our clearing account models and increased central 
counterparty margin requirements. Reporting requirements and most 
risk mitigation procedures were set at the end of 2013. Implementation 
of collateral obligations applicable to non-cleared OTC transactions 
came into force during 2017. ESMA is continuing to evaluate and set 
clearing obligations for certain OTC derivatives. We comply with the 
enacted provisions and will continue to do so when pending EMIR 
provisions are finalized as relevant to our activities.
In addition to the EMIR, European Union financial market legislation 
Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (“MIFID II”) and 
the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation (“MIFIR”) took 
effect on January 3, 2018. Principal areas of impact related to these 
regulatory texts involve the emergence and oversight of organized 
trade facilities (“OTF’s”) for trading OTC non-equity products, client 
categorization, enhanced investor protection, conflicts of interest and 
execution policies, transparency obligations and extended transaction 
reporting requirements. We will continue to monitor all applicable 
regulatory developments.
The USA PATRIOT Act contains anti-money laundering and financial 
transparency laws and mandates the implementation of various 
regulations applicable to broker-dealers and other financial services 
companies. The USA PATRIOT Act seeks to promote cooperation 
among financial institutions, regulators and law enforcement entities 
in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money 
laundering. Anti-money laundering laws outside of the U.S. contain 
similar provisions. We believe that we have implemented, and that we 
maintain, appropriate internal practices, procedures and controls to 
enable us to comply with the provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act 
and other anti-money laundering laws.
The U.S. maintains various economic sanctions programs administered 
by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control 
(“OFAC”). The OFAC administered sanctions take many forms, 
but generally prohibit or restrict trade and investment in and with 
sanctions targets, and in some cases require blocking of the target’s 
assets. Violations of any of the OFAC-administered sanctions are 
punishable by civil fines, criminal fines, and imprisonment. We 
established policies and procedures designed to comply with applicable 
OFAC requirements. Although we believe that our policies and 
procedures are effective, there can be no assurance that our policies 
and procedures will effectively prevent us from violating the OFAC-
administered sanctions in every transaction in which we may engage.

INTL FCStone Financial is a dually registered broker-dealer/FCM and 
is subject to minimum capital requirements under Section 4(f)(b) of 
the Commodity Exchange Act, Part 1.17 of the rules and regulations 
of the CFTC and the SEC Uniform Net Capital Rule 15c3-1 under 
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These rules specify the minimum 
amount of capital that must be available to support our clients’ open 
trading positions, including the amount of assets that INTL FCStone 
Financial must maintain in relatively liquid form, and are designed 
to measure general financial integrity and liquidity. Net capital and 
the related net capital requirement may fluctuate on a daily basis. 

Compliance with minimum capital requirements may limit our 
operations if we cannot maintain the required levels of capital and 
restrict the ability of INTL FCStone Financial to make distributions 
to us. Moreover, any change in these rules or the imposition of new 
rules affecting the scope, coverage, calculation or amount of capital 
we are required to maintain could restrict our ability to operate our 
business and adversely affect our operations.

Services, Inc.) is subject to the SEC Uniform Net Capital Rule 15c3-1

Segregated Client Assets

INTL FCStone Financial maintains client segregated deposits from 
its clients relating to their trading of futures and options on futures 
on U.S. commodities exchanges held with INTL FCStone Financial, 
making it subject to CFTC regulation 1.20, which specifies that such 
funds must be held in segregation and not commingled with the firm’s 
own assets. INTL FCStone Financial maintains acknowledgment 
letters from each depository at which it maintains client segregated 
deposits in which the depository acknowledges the nature of funds on 
deposit in the account. In addition, CFTC regulations require filing 
of a daily segregation calculation which compares the assets held in 
clients segregated depositories (“segregated assets”) to the firm’s total 
segregated assets held on deposit from clients (“segregated liabilities”). 
The amount of client segregated assets must be in excess of the segregated 
liabilities owed to clients and any shortfall in such assets must be 
immediately communicated to the CFTC. As of September 30, 2018, 
INTL FCStone Financial maintained $57.3 million in segregated 
assets in excess of its segregated liabilities.
In addition, INTL FCStone Financial is subject to CFTC regulation 
1.25, which governs the acceptable investment of client segregated 
assets. This regulation allows for the investment of client segregated 
assets in readily marketable instruments including U.S. Treasury 
securities, municipal securities, government sponsored enterprise 
securities, certificates of deposit, commercial paper and corporate 
notes or bonds which are guaranteed by the U.S. under the Temporary

Business Risks

We seek to mitigate the market and credit risks arising from our financial 
trading activities through an active risk management program. The 
principal objective of this program is to limit trading risk to an acceptable 
level while maximizing the return generated on the risk assumed.
We have a defined risk policy administered by our risk management 
committee, which reports to the risk committee of our board of 
directors. We established specific exposure limits for inventory positions 

in every business, as well as specific issuer limits and counterparty 
limits. We designed these limits to ensure that in a situation of 
unexpectedly large or rapid movements or disruptions in one or more 
markets, systemic financial distress, the failure of a counterparty or 
the default of an issuer, the potential estimated loss will remain within 
acceptable levels. The risk committee of our board of directors reviews 
the performance of the risk management committee on a quarterly 
basis to monitor compliance with the established risk policy.

Employees

As of September 30, 2018, we employed 1,701 people globally: 1,092 in the U.S., 270 in the United Kingdom, 143 in Brazil, 76 in Argentina, 
53 in Singapore, 12 in Dubai, 10 in the Republic of Ireland, 10 in Australia, 9 in Paraguay, 9 in China, 4 in Hong Kong, 9 in Mexico and 
4 in Canada. None of our employees operate under a collective bargaining agreement, and we have not suffered any work stoppages or labor 
disputes. Many of our employees are subject to employment agreements, certain of which contain non-competition provisions.

ITEM 1A Risk Factors

We face a variety of risks that could adversely impact our financial 
condition and results of operations, including the following:

Our ability to achieve consistent profitability is subject 
to uncertainty due to the nature of our businesses and 
the markets in which we operate. 
During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 we recorded net 
income of $55.5 million, compared to net income of $6.4 million 
in fiscal 2017 and $54.7 million in fiscal 2016.

Our revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly in the 
future because of the following factors:
•• market conditions, such as price levels and volatility in the 
commodities, securities and foreign exchange markets in which 
we operate;
•• changes in the volume of our market-making and trading activities;
•• changes in the value of our financial instruments, currency and 
commodities positions and our ability to manage related risks;
•• the level and volatility of interest rates;

10

                                 - Form 10-K•• the availability and cost of funding and capital;
•• our ability to manage personnel, overhead and other expenses;
•• changes in execution and clearing fees;
•• the addition or loss of sales or trading professionals;
•• reduction in fee revenues from client trading and wealth management 
services;
•• changes in legal and regulatory requirements; and
•• general economic and political conditions.
Although we continue our efforts to diversify the sources of our revenues, 
it is likely that our revenues and operating results will continue to 
fluctuate substantially in the future and such fluctuations could result in 
losses. These losses could have a material adverse effect on our business, 
financial condition and operating results.

The manner in which we account for certain of our 
precious metals and energy commodities inventory may 
increase the volatility of our reported earnings. 
Our net income is subject to volatility due to the manner in which we 
report our precious metals and energy commodities inventory held by 
subsidiaries that are not broker-dealers. Our precious metals and energy 
inventory held in subsidiaries which are not broker-dealers is stated 
at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We generally mitigate the 
price risk associated with our commodities inventory through the use 
of derivatives. We do not elect hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP for 
this price risk mitigation. In such situations, any unrealized gains in our 
precious metals and energy inventory in our non-broker-dealer subsidiaries 
are not recognized under U.S. GAAP, but unrealized gains and losses 
in related derivative positions are recognized under U.S. GAAP. As a 
result, our reported earnings from these business segments are subject 
to greater volatility than the earnings from our other business segments.

Our level of indebtedness could adversely affect our 
financial condition. 
As of September 30, 2018, our total consolidated indebtedness was 
$355.2 million, and we may increase our indebtedness in the future 
as we continue to expand our business. Our indebtedness could have 
important consequences and significant effects on our business, including:
•• increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry 
conditions;
•• requiring that a portion of our cash flow from operations be used 
for the payment of interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing 
our ability to use our cash flow to fund working capital, capital 
expenditures, acquisitions, investments and general corporate 
requirements;
•• making it difficult for us to optimally manage the cash flow for 
our businesses;
•• limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future 
working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments and 
general corporate requirements;
•• limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in 
our business and the markets in which we operate; and

PART I 
ITEM 1A Risk Factors

•• subjecting us to a number of restrictive covenants that, among other 
things, limit our ability to pay dividends and make distributions, 
make acquisitions and dispositions, borrow additional funds and 
make capital expenditures and other investments.
We may be able to incur additional indebtedness in the future, including 
secured indebtedness. If new indebtedness is added to our current 
indebtedness levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify.

Committed credit facilities currently available to us 
might not be renewed. 
We currently have four committed credit facilities under which we 
may borrow up to $594.5 million, consisting of:
•• a $262.0 million facility available to the Company, for general 
working capital requirements, committed until March 18, 2019.
•• a $75.0 million facility available to INTL FCStone Financial, for 
short-term funding of margin to commodity exchanges, committed 
until April 4, 2019.
•• a $232.5 million committed facility available to our wholly owned 
subsidiary, FCStone Merchant Services, LLC, for financing traditional 
commodity financing arrangements and commodity repurchase 
agreements, committed until November 1, 2019.
•• a $25.0 million facility available to our wholly owned subsidiary, 
INTL FCStone Ltd, for short-term funding of margin to commodity 
exchanges, committed until January 31, 2019.
Of our committed credit facilities, $362 million are scheduled to 
expire during the 12-month period beginning with the filing date of 
this Annual Report on Form 10-K. There is no guarantee that we will 
be successful in renewing, extending or rearranging these facilities.
The Company’s business requires substantial cash to support its operating 
activities. Our business involves the establishment and carrying of 
substantial open positions for clients on futures exchanges and in the 
OTC derivatives markets. We are required to post and maintain margin 
or credit support for these positions. Although we collect margin or 
other deposits from our clients for these positions, significant adverse 
price movements can occur which will require us to post margin or 
other deposits on short notice, whether or not we are able to collect 
additional margin or credit support from our clients. We have systems 
in place to collect margin and other deposits from clients on a same-
day basis; however, there can be no assurance that these facilities and 
systems will be adequate to eliminate the risk of margin calls in the 
event of severe adverse price movements affecting open positions of 
our clients. As such, the Company may be dependent on its lines of 
credit and other financing facilities in order to fund margin calls and 
other operating activities.
It is possible that these facilities might not be renewed at the end of their 
commitment periods and that we will be unable to replace them with 
other facilities on terms favorable to us or at all. If our credit facilities are 
unavailable or insufficient to support future levels of business activities, 
we may need to raise additional funds externally, either in the form 
of debt or equity. If we cannot raise additional funds on acceptable 
terms, we may not be able to develop or enhance our business, take 
advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressure 
or unanticipated requirements, leading to reduced profitability.

11

ITEM 1A Risk Factors

Our failure to successfully integrate the operations of 
businesses acquired could have a material adverse effect 
on our business, financial condition and operating 
results.
From time to time, we may seek to expand our product offerings 
and /or geographic presence through acquisitions of complementary 
businesses, technologies or services. Our ability to engage in suitable 
acquisitions will depend on our ability to identify opportunities 
for potential acquisitions that fit within our business model, enter 
into the agreements necessary to take advantage of these potential 
opportunities and obtain any necessary financing. We may not be 
able to do so successfully. We are regularly evaluating potential 
acquisition opportunities.
We will need to meet challenges to realize the expected benefits and 
synergies of these acquisitions, including:
•• integrating the management teams, strategies, cultures, technologies 
and operations of the acquired companies;
•• retaining and assimilating the key personnel of acquired companies;
•• retaining existing clients of the acquired companies;
•• creating uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies and 
information systems; and
•• achieving revenue growth because of risks involving (1) the ability 
to retain clients, (2) the ability to sell the services and products 
of the acquired companies to the existing clients of our other 
business segments, and (3) the ability to sell the services and 
products of our other business segments to the existing clients of 
the acquired companies.
The accomplishment of these objectives will involve considerable 
risk, including:
•• the potential disruption of each company’s ongoing business and 
distraction of their respective management teams;
•• unanticipated expenses related to technology integration; and
•• potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquisitions.
It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of 
the technical skills and management expertise of key employees, the 
disruption of the ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, 
controls, procedures and policies due to possible cultural conflicts 
or differences of opinions on technical decisions and product road 
maps that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with 
clients, counterparties, and employees or to achieve the anticipated 
benefits of the acquisition.

We face risks associated with our market-making and 
trading activities.
We conduct our market-making and trading activities predominantly 
as a principal, which subjects our capital to significant risks. These 
activities involve the purchase, sale or short sale for clients and for 
our own account of financial instruments, including equity and debt 
securities, commodities and foreign exchange. These activities are 
subject to a number of risks, including risks of price fluctuations, rapid 
changes in the liquidity of markets and counterparty creditworthiness.

12

These risks may limit our ability to either resell financial instruments we 
purchased or to repurchase securities we sold in these transactions. In 
addition, we may experience difficulty borrowing financial instruments 
to make delivery to purchasers to whom we sold short, or lenders from 
whom we have borrowed. From time to time, we have large position 
concentrations in securities of a single issuer or issuers in specific countries 
and markets. This concentration could result in higher trading losses 
than would occur if our positions and activities were less concentrated.
The success of our market-making activities depends on:
•• the price volatility of specific financial instruments, currencies and 
commodities,
•• our ability to attract order flow;
•• the skill of our personnel;
•• the availability of capital; and
•• general market conditions.
To attract market-trading, market-making and trading business, we 
must be competitive in:
•• providing enhanced liquidity to our clients;
•• the efficiency of our order execution;
•• the sophistication of our trading technology; and
•• the quality of our client service.
In our role as a market maker and trader, we attempt to derive a 
profit from the difference between the prices at which we buy and 
sell financial instruments, currencies and commodities. However, 
competitive forces often require us to:
•• match the quotes other market makers display; and
•• hold varying amounts of financial instruments, currencies and 
commodities in inventory.
By having to maintain inventory positions, we are subject to a high 
degree of risk. We cannot ensure that we will be able to manage our 
inventory risk successfully or that we will not experience significant 
losses, either of which could materially adversely affect our business, 
financial condition and operating results.

Fluctuations in currency exchange rates could 
negatively impact our earnings.
A significant portion of our international business is conducted in 
currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and changes in foreign exchange 
rates relative to the U.S. dollar can therefore affect the value of our 
non-U.S. dollar net assets, revenues and expenses. Although we 
closely monitor potential exposures as a result of these fluctuations in 
currencies and adopt strategies designed to reduce the impact of these 
fluctuations on our financial performance, there can be no assurance 
that we will be successful in managing our foreign exchange risk. 
Our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations will grow if the 
relative contribution of our operations outside the U.S. increases. Any 
material fluctuations in currencies could have a material effect on our 
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

                                 - Form 10-KWe are exposed to certain risks as a result of operating in 
countries with high levels of inflation.
We are exposed to risks as a result of operating in countries with 
high levels of inflation. These risks include the risk that the rate of 
price increases will not keep pace with the cost of inflation, adverse 
economic conditions may discourage business growth which could 
affect demand for our services, the devaluation of the currency may 
exceed the rate of inflation and reported U.S. dollar revenues and 
profits may decline, and these countries may be deemed “highly 
inflationary” for U.S. GAAP purposes.
For example, we have wholly owned subsidiaries in Argentina which 
employed 76 people as of September 30, 2018, and primarily conduct 
debt trading and asset management business activities for clients. 
The Argentinian economy was recently determined to be highly 
inflationary. For U.S. GAAP purposes, a highly inflationary economy 
is one where the cumulative inflation rate for the three years preceding 
the beginning of the reporting period, including interim reporting 
periods, is in excess of 100 percent. Argentina’s inflation rate reached 
this threshold during the quarterly period ended June 30, 2018. For 
periods through June 30, 2018, the functional currency for certain 
of our subsidiaries was the Argentinian peso, the local currency of 
these subsidiaries. In accordance with this designation, effective July 1, 
2018 we report the financial results of the subsidiaries in Argentina 
at the functional currency of their parent, which is the U.S. dollar. 
Going forward, fluctuations in the Argentinian peso to U.S. dollar 
exchange rate could negatively impact our earnings.

We operate as a principal in the OTC derivatives 
markets which involves the risks associated with 
commodity derivative instruments.
We offer OTC derivatives to our clients in which we act as a principal 
counterparty. We endeavor to simultaneously offset the underlying 
risk of the instruments, such as commodity price risk, by establishing 
corresponding offsetting positions with commodity counterparties, 
or alternatively we may offset those transactions with similar but 
not identical positions on an exchange. To the extent that we are 
unable to simultaneously offset an open position or the offsetting 
transaction is not effective to fully eliminate the derivative risk, we 
have market risk exposure on these unmatched transactions. Our 
exposure varies based on the size of the overall positions, the terms 
and liquidity of the instruments brokered, and the amount of time 
the positions remain open.
To the extent an unhedged position is not disposed of intra-day, adverse 
movements in the reference assets or rates underlying these positions 
or a downturn or disruption in the markets for these positions could 
result in a substantial loss. In addition, any principal gains and losses 
resulting from these positions could on occasion have a disproportionate 
effect, positive or negative, on our financial condition and results of 
operations for any particular reporting period.
Transactions involving OTC derivative contracts may be adversely 
affected by fluctuations in the level, volatility, correlation or relationship 
between market prices, rates, indices and/or other factors. These types 
of instruments may also suffer from illiquidity in the market or in 
a related market.

PART I 
ITEM 1A Risk Factors

OTC derivative transactions are subject to unique 
risks. 
OTC derivative transactions are subject to the risk that, as a result 
of mismatches or delays in the timing of cash flows due from or to 
counterparties in OTC derivative transactions or related hedging, 
trading, collateral or other transactions, we or our counterparty may 
not have adequate cash available to fund our or its current obligations.
We could incur material losses pursuant to OTC derivative transactions 
because of inadequacies in or failures of our internal systems and 
controls for monitoring and quantifying the risk and contractual 
obligations associated with OTC derivative transactions and related 
transactions or for detecting human error, systems failure or management 
failure.
OTC derivative transactions may generally only be modified or 
terminated only by mutual consent of the parties to any such transaction 
(other than in certain limited default and other specified situations (e.g., 
market disruption events)) and subject to agreement on individually 
negotiated terms. Accordingly, it may not be possible to modify, 
terminate or offset obligations or exposure to the risk associated with 
a transaction prior to its scheduled termination date.
In addition, we note that as a result of rules recently adopted by 
U.S. regulators concerning certain financial contracts (including 
OTC derivatives) entered into with our counterparties that have been 
designated as global systemically important banking organizations, we 
may be restricted in our ability to terminate such contracts following 
the occurrence of certain insolvency-related default events. The rules 
are being progressively implemented between January 1, 2019 and 
January 1, 2020.

Changes to the U.S. corporate tax system have had and 
may in the future continue to have a significant effect 
on the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets and 
will result in additional U.S. corporate tax liabilities 
on unremitted earnings from deemed repatriation of 
earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. 
The recent reform of the U.S. tax system includes changes to corporate 
tax rates, a one-time mandatory repatriation transition tax on previously 
untaxed accumulated and current earnings and profits of certain of 
our foreign subsidiaries and also establishes new tax laws that will 
affect the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019 and subsequent 
fiscal years, including, but not limited to, (1) elimination of the 
corporate alternative minimum tax, (2) a new provision designed 
to tax global intangible low-taxed income, (3) limitations on the 
utilization of net operating losses incurred in tax years beginning after 
September 30, 2018 to 80% of taxable income per tax year, (4) the 
creation of the base erosion anti-abuse tax, (5) a general elimination 
of U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries, 
and (6) limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and certain 
executive compensation.
As of September 30, 2018, the remeasurement of the deferred tax assets 
and liabilities resulted in $8.6 million of tax expense. The accounting 
for this amount is considered complete.

13

                                  - Form 10-KPART I 
ITEM 1A Risk Factors

The transition tax requires us to determine, in addition to other 
factors, the amount of post 1986 earnings and profits of the relevant 
subsidiaries, as well as the amount of non-US income taxes paid on 
such earnings. We made a reasonable estimate of the transition tax and 
recorded a provisional transition tax obligation as of September 30, 
2018 of $11.2 million. While we can make reasonable estimates 
for the deemed repatriation transition tax, the final tax impact may 
differ from these estimates, due to, among other things, changes in 
our interpretations and assumptions, additional guidance that may 
be issued by taxing authorities, and actions we may take.
Most state and local income tax jurisdictions have updated their 
conformity or issued guidance on their level of conformity with the 
U.S. federal income tax changes as of September 30, 2018. We are 
able to calculate the impact of the reduction in corporate rate and 
the deemed repatriation transition tax for state and local income tax 
purposes and the impact on tax expense is immaterial.

We may have difficulty managing our growth. 
We have experienced significant growth in our business. Our operating 
revenues grew from $490.9 million in fiscal 2014 to $975.8 million 
in fiscal 2018. This growth may continue, including as a result of 
any acquisitions we have recently undertaken or may undertake in 
the future.
This growth required, and will continue to require, us to increase our 
investment in management personnel, financial and management 
systems and controls, and facilities. In the absence of continued 
revenue growth, or if growth is at a rate lower than our expectations, 
the costs associated with our expected growth would cause our operating 
margins to decline from current levels. In addition, as is common in 
the financial industry, we are and will continue to be highly dependent 
on the effective and reliable operation of our communications and 
information systems.
The scope of procedures for assuring compliance with applicable rules 
and regulations changes as the size and complexity of our business 
increases. In response, we have implemented and continue to revise 
formal compliance procedures; however, there can be no assurances 
that such procedures will be effective.
It is possible that we will not be able to manage our growth successfully. 
Our inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on our 
business, financial condition and operating results.

Lapses in disclosure controls and procedures or internal 
control over financial reporting could materially 
and adversely affect our operations, profitability or 
reputation. 
As an SEC reporting company, we are required to maintain a system 
of effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure 
controls and procedures. Nevertheless, lapses or deficiencies in 
disclosure controls and procedures or in our internal control over 
financial reporting may occur from time to time.

14

There can be no assurance that our disclosure controls and procedures 
will be effective in the future or that a material weakness in internal 
control over financial reporting will not exist. Any such lapses or 
deficiencies may materially and adversely affect our business and results 
of operations or financial condition, require us to expend significant 
resources to correct the lapses or deficiencies, expose us to regulatory 
or legal proceedings, subject us to fines, penalties, judgments or losses 
not covered by insurance, harm our reputation, or otherwise cause a 
decline in investor confidence.

Our risk management policies and procedures may 
leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk, 
which could harm our business. 
We have devoted significant resources to develop our risk management 
policies and procedures and expect to continue to do so in the 
future. However, our risk management policies and procedures may 
not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market 
environments or against all types of risk, including risks that are 
unidentified or unanticipated. Our risk management policies and 
procedures require, among other things, that we properly record and 
verify many thousands of transactions and events each day, and that 
we continuously monitor and evaluate the size and nature of our or 
our clients’ and counterparties’ positions and the associated risks. 
In light of the high volume of transactions, it is impossible for us 
to review and assess every single transaction or to monitor at every 
moment in time our or our clients’ and counterparties’ positions and 
the associated risks.
Our policies and procedures used to identify, monitor and mitigate 
a variety of risks, including risks related to human error, client 
defaults, market movements, fraud and money-laundering, are 
established and reviewed by the Risk Committee of our Board of 
Directors. Some of our methods for managing risk are discretionary 
by nature and are based on internally developed controls and observed 
historical market behavior, and also involve reliance on standard 
industry practices. These methods may not adequately prevent 
losses, particularly as they relate to extreme market movements, 
which may be significantly greater than historical fluctuations in 
the market. Our risk management policies and procedures also may 
not adequately prevent losses due to technical errors if our testing 
and quality control practices are not effective in preventing software 
or hardware failures. In addition, we may elect to adjust our risk 
management policies and procedures to allow for an increase in risk 
tolerance, which could expose us to the risk of greater losses. Our 
risk management policies and procedures rely on a combination of 
technical and human controls and supervision that are subject to 
error and failure. These policies and procedures may not protect us 
against all risks or may protect us less than anticipated, in which 
case our business, financial condition and results of operations and 
cash flows may be materially adversely affected.

                                 - Form 10-KWe are exposed to the credit risk of our clients and 
counterparties and their failure to meet their financial 
obligations could adversely affect our business. 
We have substantial credit risk in both our securities and commodities 
businesses. As a market maker of OTC and listed securities and a 
dealer in fixed income securities, we conduct the majority of our 
securities transactions as principal with institutional counterparties. 
We clear the majority of our principal securities transactions through 
unaffiliated clearing brokers or banks, who also are the custodian 
of the majority of our principal equity and debt securities. In these 
transactions, we may suffer losses as a result of a counterparty’s failure 
to fulfill its contractual obligations. We borrow securities from, and 
lend securities to, other broker-dealers, and may also enter into 
agreements to repurchase and agreements to resell securities. Adverse 
changes in market conditions related to securities utilized in these 
transactions may result in losses if counterparties to these transactions 
fail to honor their commitments.
In our correspondent securities clearing and independent wealth 
management businesses, we permit clients to purchase securities on 
margin, subject to various regulatory and internal margin requirements. 
During periods of significant price declines, the value of collateral 
securing the client’s margin loan may decline below the client’s obligation 
to us. In the event, the client is unable to deposit additional collateral 
for these margin loans, we may incur credit losses on these transactions 
or additional costs in attempting to secure additional collateral. 
While introducing broker-dealers and independent representatives 
are generally responsible for the credit losses of their clients, we may 
incur losses if they do not fulfill their obligations.
As a clearing broker in futures and option transactions, we act on behalf 
of our clients for all trades consummated on exchanges. We must pay 
initial and variation margin to the exchanges before we receive the 
required payments from our clients. Accordingly, we are responsible 
for our clients’ obligations with respect to these transactions, including 
margin payments, which exposes us to significant credit risk. Client 
positions which represent a significant percentage of open positions 
in a given market or concentrations in illiquid markets may expose 
us to the risk that we are not able to liquidate a client’s position in a 
manner which does not result in a deficit in that clients account. A 
substantial part of our working capital is at risk if clients default on 
their obligations to us and their account balances and security deposits 
are insufficient to meet all of their obligations.
We act as a principal for OTC derivative transactions (including 
commodity, foreign exchange and interest rate transaction), which 
exposes us to both the credit risk of our clients and the counterparties 
with which we offset the client’s position. As with exchange-traded 
transactions, our OTC transactions require that we meet initial and 
variation margin payments on behalf of our clients before we receive 
the required payment from our clients. In addition, with OTC 
transactions, there is a risk that a counterparty will fail to meet its 
obligations when due. We would then be exposed to the risk that a 
settlement of a transaction which is due a client will not be collected 
from the respective counterparty with which the transaction was 
offset. Clients and counterparties that owe us money, securities or 
other assets may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, 
lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons.

PART I 
ITEM 1A Risk Factors

We act as a principal in our physical commodities trading activities 
which exposes us to the credit risk of our counterparties and clients 
in these activities.
Although we have procedures for reviewing credit exposures to specific 
clients and counterparties to address present credit concerns, default 
risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect 
or foresee, including rapid changes in securities, commodity and 
foreign exchange price levels. Some of our risk management methods 
depend upon the evaluation of information regarding markets, clients 
or other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible 
by us. That information may not, in all cases, be accurate, complete, 
up-to-date or properly evaluated. In addition, concerns about, or a 
default by, one institution could lead to significant liquidity problems, 
losses or defaults by other institutions, which in turn could adversely 
affect us. We may be materially and adversely affected in the event of 
a significant default by our clients and counterparties.
In our securities, commodities and derivatives trading businesses we 
rely on the ability of our clearing brokers and banks to adequately 
discharge their obligations on a timely basis. We also depend on the 
solvency of our clearing brokers and custodians. Any failure by a 
clearing broker or bank to adequately discharge its obligations on a 
timely basis, or insolvency of a clearing broker or custodian, or any 
event adversely affecting our clearing brokers or custodians, could 
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition 
and operating results.
As a clearing member firm of clearing houses in the U.S. and abroad, 
we are also exposed to clearing member credit risk. Clearing houses 
require member firms to deposit cash and/or government securities to 
a clearing fund. If a clearing member defaults in its obligations to the 
clearing house in an amount larger than its own margin and clearing 
fund deposits, the shortfall is absorbed pro rata from the deposits of 
the other clearing members of the applicable clearing house. Several 
clearing houses of which we are members also have the authority 
to assess their members for additional funds if the clearing fund is 
depleted. A large clearing member default could result in a substantial 
cost to us if we are required to pay such assessments.

Our net operating revenues may decrease due to 
changes in market volume, prices or liquidity. 
Declines in the volume of securities, commodities and derivative 
transactions and in market liquidity generally may result in lower 
revenues from market-making and trading activities. Changes in 
price levels of securities and commodities and other assets, and 
interest and foreign exchange rates also may result in reduced trading 
activity and reduce our revenues from market-making transactions. 
Changed price levels also can result in losses from changes in the fair 
value of securities, commodities and other assets held in inventory. 
Sudden sharp changes in fair values of securities, commodities and 
other assets can result in:
•• illiquid markets;
•• fair value losses arising from positions held by us;
•• the failure of buyers and sellers of securities, commodities and other 
assets to fulfill their settlement obligations;

15

                                  - Form 10-KPART I 
ITEM 1A Risk Factors

•• redemptions from funds managed in our asset management business 
segment and consequent reductions in management fees;
•• reductions in accrued performance fees in our asset management 
business segment; and
•• increases in claims and litigation.
Any change in market volume, price or liquidity or any other of these 
factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial 
condition and operating results.

Our net operating revenues may decrease due to 
changes in client trading volumes which are dependent 
in large part on commodity prices and commodity 
price volatility. 
Client trading volumes are largely driven by the degree of volatility—the 
magnitude and frequency of fluctuations—in prices of commodities. 
Higher volatility increases the need to hedge contractual price risk and 
creates opportunities for arbitrage trading. Energy and agricultural 
commodities markets periodically experience significant price volatility. 
In addition to price volatility, increases in commodity prices generally 
lead to increased trading volume. As prices of commodities rise, 
especially energy prices, new participants enter the markets to address 
their growing risk-management needs or to take advantage of greater 
trading opportunities. Sustained periods of stability in the prices of 
commodities or generally lower prices could result in lower trading 
volumes and, potentially, lower revenues. Lower volatility and lower 
volumes could lead to lower client balances held on deposit, which 
in turn may reduce the amount of interest revenue and account fees 
based on these deposits.
Factors that are particularly likely to affect price volatility and price 
levels of commodities include:
•• supply and demand of commodities;
•• weather conditions affecting certain commodities;
•• national and international economic and political conditions;
•• perceived stability of commodities and financial markets;
•• the level and volatility of interest rates and inflation; and
•• financial strength of market participants.
Any one or more of these factors may reduce price volatility or price 
levels in the markets for commodities trading, which in turn could 
reduce trading activity in those markets. Moreover, any reduction in 
trading activity could reduce liquidity which in turn could further 
discourage existing and potential market participants and thus 
accelerate any decline in the level of trading activity in these markets.

Our net operating revenues may be impacted by 
diminished market activity due to adverse economic, 
political and market conditions.
The amount of our revenues depends in part on the level of activity 
in the securities, foreign exchange and commodities markets in which 
we conduct business. The level of activity in these markets is directly 
affected by numerous national and international factors that are 
beyond our control, including:

16

•• economic, political and market conditions;
•• the availability of short-term and long-term funding and capital;
•• the level and volatility of interest rates;
•• legislative and regulatory changes; and
•• currency values and inflation.
Any one or more of these factors may reduce the level of activity in any 
of these markets in which we conduct business, which could result in 
lower revenues from our market-making and trading activities. Any 
reduction in revenues or any loss resulting from these factors could 
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition 
and operating results.

We depend on our management team. 
Our future success depends, in large part, upon our management 
team who possess extensive knowledge and management skills with 
respect to securities, commodities and foreign exchange businesses 
we operate. The unexpected loss of services of any of our executive 
officers could adversely affect our ability to manage our business 
effectively or execute our business strategy. Although some of these 
officers have employment contracts with us, they are generally not 
required to remain with us for a specified period of time.

We depend on our ability to attract and retain key 
personnel.
Competition for key personnel and other highly qualified management, 
sales, trading, compliance and technical personnel is significant. It 
is possible that we will be unable to retain our key personnel and to 
attract, assimilate or retain other highly qualified personnel in the 
future. The loss of the services of any of our key personnel or the 
inability to identify, hire, train and retain other qualified personnel 
in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, 
financial condition and operating results.
From time to time, other companies in the financial sector have 
experienced losses of sales and trading professionals. The level of 
competition to attract these professionals is intense. It is possible 
that we will lose professionals due to increased competition or other 
factors in the future. The loss of a sales and trading professional, 
particularly a senior professional with broad industry expertise, could 
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition 
and operating results.

In the event of employee misconduct or error, our 
business may be harmed. 
There have been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud 
or other misconduct by employees of financial services firms in recent 
years. Employee misconduct or error could subject us to legal liability, 
financial losses and regulatory sanctions and could seriously harm our 
reputation and negatively affect our business. Misconduct by employees 
could include engaging in improper or unauthorized transactions or 
activities, failing to properly supervise other employees or improperly 
using confidential information. Employee errors, including mistakes 
in executing, recording or processing transactions for clients, could 

                                 - Form 10-Kcause us to enter into transactions that clients may disavow and 
refuse to settle, which could expose us to the risk of material losses 
even if the errors are detected and the transactions are unwound or 
reversed. If our clients are not able to settle their transactions on a 
timely basis due to employee error, our risk of material loss could be 
increased. The risk of employee error or miscommunication may be 
greater for products that are new or have non-standardized terms. 
It is not always possible to deter employee misconduct or error, and 
the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not 
be effective in all cases.

Internal or third party computer and communications 
systems failures, capacity constraints and breaches of 
security could increase our operating costs and/or credit 
losses, decrease net operating revenues and cause us to lose 
clients.
We are heavily dependent on the capacity and reliability of the computer 
and communications systems supporting our operations, whether 
owned and operated internally or by third parties, including those 
used for execution and clearance of our client’s trades and our market-
making activities. We receive and process a large portion of our trade 
orders through electronic means, such as through public and private 
communications networks. These computer and communications 
systems and networks are subject to performance degradation or failure 
from any number of reasons, including loss of power, acts of war or 
terrorism, human error, natural disasters, fire, sabotage, hardware or 
software malfunctions or defects, computer viruses, intentional acts 
of vandalism, client error or misuse, lack of proper maintenance or 
monitoring and similar events. Our systems, or those of our third 
party providers, may fail or operate slowly, causing one or more of 
the following:
•• unanticipated disruptions in service to our clients;
•• slower response times;
•• delays in our clients’ trade execution;
•• failed settlement of trades;
•• decreased client satisfaction with our services;
•• incomplete, untimely or inaccurate accounting, recording, reporting 
or processing of trades;
•• financial losses;
•• litigation or other client claims; and
•• regulatory sanctions.
In addition, in connection with our business, we collect and retain 
personally identifiable information of our clients. The continued 
occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of the serious 
threats to information security. Our clients expect that we will adequately 
protect their personal information, and the regulatory environment 
surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding. 
Protecting against security breaches, including cyber-security attacks, is 
an increasing challenge, and penetrated or compromised data systems 
or the intentional, inadvertent or negligent release or disclosure of data 
could result in theft, loss or fraudulent or unlawful use of client or 
company data. It is possible that our security controls over personally 

PART I 
ITEM 1A Risk Factors

identifiable information, our training of employees on data security 
and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure 
of personally identifiable information that we store and manage.
The occurrence of degradation or failure of the communications 
and computer systems on which we rely, or the significant theft, 
loss or fraudulent use of client information, may lead to financial 
losses, litigation or arbitration claims filed by or on behalf of our 
clients and regulatory investigations and sanctions, including by the 
CFTC, which require that our trade execution and communications 
systems be able to handle anticipated present and future peak trading 
volumes. Any such degradation or failure, or theft, loss or fraudulent 
use of client information, could also have a negative effect on our 
reputation, which in turn could cause us to lose existing clients to 
our competitors or make it more difficult for us to attract new clients 
in the future. Further, any financial loss that we suffer as a result of 
such degradations or failures in the performance of our computer 
and communications systems and networks could be magnified by 
price movements of contracts involved in transactions impacted by 
the degradation or failure, and we may be unable to take corrective 
action to mitigate any losses we suffer.

We are subject to extensive government regulation. 
The securities and derivatives industries are subject to extensive 
regulation under federal, state and foreign laws. In addition, the SEC, 
the CFTC, FINRA, the MSRB, the FCA, the NFA, the CME Group, 
Inc. and other self-regulatory organizations (commonly referred to as 
SROs), state securities commissions, and foreign securities regulators 
require compliance with their respective rules and regulations. These 
regulatory bodies are responsible for safeguarding the integrity of 
the financial markets and protecting the interests of participants in 
those markets.
As participants in various financial markets and exchanges, we may 
be subject to regulation concerning certain aspects of our business, 
including without limitation:
•• risk management;
•• trade practices; 
•• the way we communicate with, market our products and services 
to, and disclose risks to, clients; 
•• financial, transaction and other reporting requirements and practices; 
•• client identification and anti-money laundering requirements; 
•• capital structure; 
•• record creation and retention;
•• safeguarding and management of client assets and personal 
information;
•• conflicts of interest; and 
•• the conduct of our directors, officers and employees. 
Failure to comply with any of these laws, rules or regulations could 
result in adverse consequences. We and certain of our officers and 
employees have been subject to claims arising from acts that regulators 
asserted were in contravention of these laws, rules and regulations. 

17

                                  - Form 10-KPART I 
ITEM 1A Risk Factors

These claims resulted in the payment of fines and/or other settlement 
terms (including requiring us to rectify any deficiencies identified by 
the applicable regulator - for example, amending our policies and 
procedures). It is possible that we, our officers and other employees 
will be subject to similar claims in the future. An adverse ruling 
against us or our officers and other employees could result in our or 
our officers and other employees being required to pay a substantial 
fine and/or other settlement terms and could result in a suspension or 
revocation of required registrations or memberships. Such sanctions 
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition 
and operating results.
The regulatory environment in which we operate is subject to change. 
Any rule changes, additional legislation or regulations (including 
changes required under the Dodd-Frank Act) and any new or revised 
regulation by the SEC, the CFTC, other U.S. or foreign governmental 
regulatory authorities, SROs, MSRB, NFA or FINRA could have 
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and 
operating results. Changes in the interpretation or enforcement of 
existing laws and rules by these governmental authorities, SROs, 
MSRB, NFA and FINRA could also have a material adverse effect 
on our business, financial condition and operating results. Failure to 
comply with current or future legislation or regulations that apply 
to our operations could subject us to fines, penalties or material 
restrictions on our business in the future.
Additional regulation, changes in existing laws and rules, or changes 
in interpretations or enforcement of existing laws and rules often 
directly affect financial services firms. We cannot predict what effect 
any such changes might have on our business. Our business, financial 
condition and operating results may be materially affected by both 
regulations that are directly applicable to us and/or our counterparties 
and regulations of general application. Our level of trading and 
market-making activities can be affected not only by such legislation 
or regulations of general applicability, but also by industry-specific 
legislation or regulations.

We have incurred significant additional operational 
and compliance costs to meet regulatory requirements. 
These requirements have significantly affect our 
business and will continue to do so in the future. 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 
(the “Dodd-Frank Act”) was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The 
Dodd-Frank Act represents a comprehensive change to financial 
regulation in the U.S., and affects virtually every area of the capital 
markets, including, among other things, centralized clearing of 
standardized derivatives (with certain stated exceptions), the trading 
of clearable derivatives on swap execution facilities or exchanges, and 
registration and comprehensive regulation of market participants 
such as “swap dealers”. Implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act has 
required, and will continue to require, many lengthy rulemaking 
processes resulting in the adoption of a multitude of new regulations 
applicable to entities which transact business in the U.S. or with U.S. 
persons outside the U.S. The Dodd-Frank Act affects many aspects, 
in the U.S. and internationally, of our business, including OTC 
derivatives and other financial activities, and will have an effect on our 

18

revenue and profitability, limit our ability to pursue certain business 
opportunities, impact the value of assets that we hold, require us to 
change certain business practices, impose additional costs on us and 
otherwise adversely affect our business.
The Dodd-Frank Act granted regulatory authorities, such as the 
CFTC and the SEC, broad rule-making authority to implement 
various provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, including comprehensive 
regulation of the OTC derivatives market. A substantial majority of the 
OTC derivatives transactions in which our subsidiaries and affiliates 
engage are subject to regulation by the CFTC, which has finalized 
and implemented most of the rules required under the Dodd-Frank 
Act. However, because the regulatory program for OTC derivatives is 
comparatively new, it is difficult to predict the extent to which we and 
our subsidiaries and affiliates will be affected by these implementing 
regulations as they come into effect. Accordingly, we cannot provide 
assurance that new legislation and regulation will not eventually have 
an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows 
and financial condition.
We have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs to 
comply with these regulatory requirements. We have also incurred and 
expect to continue to incur significant costs related to the development, 
operation and continued enhancement of our technology relating 
to many facets of our business, including trade execution, trade 
reporting, surveillance, record keeping and data reporting obligations, 
compliance and back-up and disaster recovery plans designed to meet 
the requirements of the regulators.
Changes that have been, and that will continue to be made to, our 
OTC and clearing businesses in order to comply with our regulatory 
obligations have impacted the way be conduct these businesses and 
may adversely impact our current and future results of operations. As 
a result of the increased financial regulation (including as a result of 
the Dodd-Frank Act), the markets for cleared and non-cleared swaps 
may become less robust, there may be less volume and liquidity in 
these markets and there may be less demand for our services. This 
may occur as a result of, for example, certain banks and other large 
institutions being limited in their conduct of proprietary trading 
and being limited or prohibited from trading in certain derivatives. 
These rules, including the restrictions and limitations on the trading 
activities of certain banks and large institutions, may impact transaction 
volumes and liquidity in the markets in which we operate and our 
revenues would be adversely impacted as a result.
These changes to our OTC derivatives and clearing businesses may also 
adversely impact our cash flows and financial condition. Registration 
requirements have and will continue to impose substantial regulatory 
requirements upon certain of our entities including, among other 
things, capital and margin requirements, business conduct standards, 
initial and variation margin requirements, and record keeping and 
data reporting obligations. Increased regulatory oversight has also 
imposed administrative burdens on us related to, among other things, 
responding to regulatory examinations or investigations. Effective 
September 2016, CFTC margin rules came into effect, imposing 
new requirements on registered swap dealers (such as our subsidiary, 
INTL FCStone Markets, LLC) and certain of their counterparties 
to exchange initial and variation margin, with an implementation 
period ending in September 2020.

                                 - Form 10-KThe European Markets Infrastructure Regulation (“EMIR”) is the 
European regulation on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and 
trade repositories. EMIR has been implemented across the European 
Economic Area member states. EMIR has imposed new requirements 
on our European entities, including (a) reporting derivatives trades 
to trade repositories; (b) setting up enhanced risk management 
procedures for OTC derivative transactions; and (c) changes to our 
clearing account models and increased central counterparty margin 
requirements. Reporting requirements and most risk mitigation 
procedures were set at the end of 2013. Implementation of collateral 
obligations applicable to non-cleared OTC transactions came into 
force during 2017. ESMA is continuing to evaluate and set clearing 
obligations for certain OTC derivatives. INTL FCStone Ltd. complies 
with the enacted provisions and will do so when pending EMIR 
provisions are finalized as relevant to its activities.
In addition to EMIR, European Union financial market legislation 
MiFID II and MiFIR took effect on January 3, 2018. Principal areas 
of impact related to these regulatory texts involve the emergence and 
oversight of organized trading facilities (“OTFs”) for trading OTC non-
equity products, client categorization, enhanced investor protection, 
conflicts of interest and execution policies, transparency obligations 
and extended transaction reporting requirements. We will continue 
to monitor all applicable regulatory developments.
The increased costs associated with compliance, and the changes that 
will be required in our OTC and clearing businesses, may adversely 
impact our results of operations, cash flows, and/or financial condition.

We are subject to net capital requirements.
The SEC, FINRA and the CFTC require our dually registered broker-
dealer/FCM subsidiary, INTL FCStone Financial to maintain specific 
levels of net capital. Failure to maintain the required net capital may 
subject this subsidiary to suspension or revocation of registration by 
the SEC, and suspension or expulsion by FINRA and other regulatory 
bodies and may subject this subsidiary to limitations on its activities, 
including suspension or revocation of its registration by the CFTC 
and suspension or expulsion by the NFA and various exchanges of 
which it is a member.
SA Stone Wealth Management Inc. (formerly Sterne Agee Financial 
Services, Inc.) is subject to the SEC Uniform Net Capital Rule 15c3-1 
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
The FCA requires our United Kingdom subsidiary, INTL FCStone 
Ltd to maintain specific levels of net capital. Failure to maintain the 
required net capital may subject INTL FCStone Ltd to suspension 
or revocation of its registration by the FCA.
The Australian Securities and Investment Commission regulates 
INTL FCStone Pty. Ltd. It is subject to a net tangible asset capital 
requirement.
The Brazilian Central Bank and Securities and Exchange Commission 
of Brazil regulate INTL FCStone DTVM Ltda. and INTL FCStone 
Banco de Cambio S.A. They are a registered broker-dealer and 
registered foreign exchange bank, respectively, and are subject to 
capital adequacy requirements.
The Comision Nacional de Valores regulates INTL Gainvest S.A. and 
INTL CIBSA S.A., and they are subject to net capital and capital 

PART I 
ITEM 1A Risk Factors

adequacy requirements. The Rosario Futures Exchange and the 
General Inspector of Justice regulate INTL Capital, S.A. It is subject 
to a capital adequacy requirement.
Certain of our other non-U.S. subsidiaries are also subject to capital 
adequacy requirements promulgated by authorities of the countries 
in which they operate.
The CFTC has also proposed capital requirements requiring registered 
swap dealers (such as our subsidiary, INTL FCStone Markets, LLC) 
to maintain specific levels of net capital. If implemented as proposed, 
failure to maintain the required net capital may result in suspension or 
revocation of registration by the CFTC and suspension or expulsion 
by the NFA and various exchanges of which it is a member.
Ultimately, any failure to meet capital requirements by our dually 
registered broker-dealer/FCM subsidiary, or our other broker-dealer 
subsidiaries, could result in liquidation of the subsidiary. Failure to 
comply with the net capital rules could have material and adverse 
consequences such as limiting their operations, or restricting us from 
withdrawing capital from these subsidiaries.
Furthermore, a change in the net capital rules, the imposition of new 
rules or any unusually large charge against net capital could limit 
our operations that require the intensive use of capital. They could 
also restrict our ability to withdraw capital from these subsidiaries. 
Any limitation on our ability to withdraw capital could limit our 
ability to pay cash dividends, repay debt and repurchase shares of our 
outstanding stock. A significant operating loss or any unusually large 
charge against net capital could adversely affect our ability to expand 
or even maintain our present levels of business, which could have an 
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.
In addition to the net capital requirements, INTL FCStone Financial 
Inc. is subject to the deposit and/or collateral requirements of the 
clearing houses in which it participates (such as The Depository Trust 
& Clearing Corporation and The Options Clearing Corporation). 
These requirements may fluctuate significantly from time to time 
based upon the nature and size of client trading activity. Failure to 
meet such requirements could result in our inability to continue to 
participate in the clearing house, which would have a material adverse 
effect on the Company’s results of operation and financial condition.

We are subject to margin funding requirements on 
short notice.
Our business involves establishment and carrying of substantial open 
positions for clients on futures exchanges and in the OTC derivatives 
markets. We are required to post and maintain margin or credit support 
for these positions. Although we collect margin or other deposits from 
our clients for these positions, significant adverse price movements 
can occur which will require us to post margin or other deposits on 
short notice, whether or not we are able to collect additional margin or 
credit support from our clients. We maintain borrowing facilities for 
the purpose of funding margin and credit support and have systems 
to endeavor to collect margin and other deposits from clients on a 
same-day basis; however, there can be no assurance that these facilities 
and systems will be adequate to eliminate the risk of margin calls in 
the event of severe adverse price movements affecting open positions 
of our clients. Generally, if a client is unable to meet its margin call, 
we promptly liquidate the client’s account. However, there can be 

19

                                  - Form 10-KPART I 
ITEM 1A Risk Factors

no assurance that in each case the liquidation of the account will not 
result in a loss to us or that liquidation will be feasible, given market 
conditions, size of the account and tenor of the positions.

Low short-term interest rates negatively impact our 
profitability.
The level of prevailing short-term interest rates affects our profitability 
because we derive a portion of our revenue from interest earned 
from the investment of funds deposited with us by our clients. As of 
September 30, 2018, we had $2.6 billion in client segregated assets, the 
majority of which are generally invested in U.S. Treasury securities. In 
addition, in our correspondent securities clearing business, we earn fee 
income in lieu of interest income on client cash held in money market 
mutual funds and FDIC sweep accounts. Our financial performance 
generally benefits from rising interest rates. Higher interest rates increase 
the amount of interest income earned from these client deposits. If 
short-term interest rates remain low or start to decline further, our 
revenues derived from interest will correspondingly decline which 
would negatively impact our profitability.
Short-term interest rates are highly sensitive to factors that are beyond 
our control, including general economic conditions and the policies 
of various governmental and regulatory authorities. In particular, 
decreases in the federal funds rate by the Board of Governors of the 
Federal Reserve System usually lead to decreasing interest rates in the 
U.S., which generally lead to a decrease in short-term interest rates.

We may issue additional equity securities. 
The issuance of additional common stock or securities convertible into 
our common stock could result in dilution of the ownership interest in 
us held by existing stockholders. We are authorized to issue, without 
stockholder approval, a significant number of additional shares of 
our common stock and securities convertible into either common 
stock or preferred stock.

We are subject to risks relating to litigation and 
potential securities, commodities and derivatives law 
liability. 
We face significant legal risks in our businesses, including risks related 
to currently pending litigation involving us. Many aspects of our 
business involve substantial risks of liability, including liability under 
federal and state securities, commodities and derivatives laws, other 
federal, state and foreign laws and court decisions, as well as rules 
and regulations promulgated by the SEC, the CFTC, FINRA, the 
MSRB, the NFA, the FCA and other regulatory bodies. Substantial 
legal liability or significant regulatory action against us and our 
subsidiaries could have adverse financial effects or cause significant 
reputational harm to us, which in turn could seriously harm our 
business prospects. Any such litigation could lead to more volatility 
of our stock price.
For a further discussion of litigation risks, see Item 3—Legal 
Proceedings below and Note 11 - Commitments and Contingencies 
in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

We are subject to intense competition.
We derive a significant portion of our revenues from market-making 
and trading activities involving securities, commodities and foreign 
exchange. The market for these services, particularly market-making 
services through electronic communications gateways, is rapidly 
evolving and intensely competitive. We expect competition to continue 
and intensify in the future. We compete primarily with wholesale, 
national, and regional broker-dealers and FCMs, as well as electronic 
communications networks. We compete primarily on the basis of our 
expertise and quality of service.
We also derive a significant portion of our revenues from commodities 
risk management services. The commodity risk management industry 
is very competitive and we expect competition to continue to intensify 
in the future. Our primary competitors in this industry include both 
large, diversified financial institutions and commodity-oriented 
businesses, smaller firms that focus on specific products or regional 
markets and independent FCMs.
A number of our competitors have significantly greater financial, 
technical, marketing and other resources than we have. Some of 
them may:
•• offer alternative forms of financial intermediation as a result of 
superior technology and greater availability of information;
•• offer a wider range of services and products than we offer;
•• be larger and better capitalized;
•• have greater name recognition; and
•• have more extensive client bases.
These competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or 
evolving opportunities and client requirements. They may also be 
able to undertake more extensive promotional activities and offer 
more attractive terms to clients. Recent advances in computing and 
communications technology are substantially changing the means by 
which market-making services are delivered, including more direct 
access on-line to a wide variety of services and information. This has 
created demand for more sophisticated levels of client service. Providing 
these services may entail considerable cost without an offsetting 
increase in revenues. In addition, current and potential competitors 
have established or may establish cooperative relationships or may 
consolidate to enhance their services and products. New competitors 
or alliances among competitors may emerge and they may acquire 
significant market share.
We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete effectively with 
current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures we face 
will not have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition 
and operating results.

Our business could be adversely affected if we are 
unable to retain our existing clients or attract new 
clients.
The success of our business depends, in part, on our ability to maintain 
and increase our client base. Clients in our market are sensitive to, 
among other things, the costs of using our services, the quality of 
the services we offer, the speed and reliability of order execution and 

                                 - Form 10-KPART I 
ITEM 1A Risk Factors

Our stock price is subject to volatility. 
The market price of our common stock has been and can be expected 
to be subject to fluctuation as a result of a variety of factors, many of 
which are beyond our control, including:
•• actual or anticipated variations in our results of operations;
•• announcements of new products by us or our competitors;
•• technological innovations by us or our competitors;
•• changes in earnings estimates or buy/sell recommendations by 
financial analysts;
•• the operating and stock price performance of other companies;
•• general market conditions or conditions specific in specific markets;
•• conditions or trends affecting our industry or the economy generally;
•• announcements relating to strategic relationships or acquisitions; and
•• risk factors and uncertainties set forth elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
Because of this volatility, we may fail to meet the expectations of our 
stockholders or of securities analysts, and the trading prices of our 
common stock could decline as a result. In addition, any negative 
change in the public perception of the securities industry could depress 
our stock price regardless of our operating results.
Future sales by existing stockholders could depress the market price 
of our common stock. If our stockholders sell substantial amounts 
of our common stock in the public market, the market price of our 
common stock could fall. Such sales also might make it more difficult 
for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and price that 
we deem appropriate.

Our international operations involve special challenges 
that we may not be able to meet, which could adversely 
affect our financial results.
We engage in a significant amount of business with clients in the 
international markets. Certain additional risks are inherent in doing 
business in international markets, particularly in a regulated industry. 
These risks include:
•• the inability to manage and coordinate the various regulatory 
requirements of multiple jurisdictions that are constantly evolving 
and subject to unexpected change;
•• tariffs and other trade barriers;
•• difficulties in recruiting and retaining personnel, and managing 
international operations;
•• difficulties of debt collection in foreign jurisdictions;
•• potentially adverse tax consequences; and
•• reduced protection for intellectual property rights.

the breadth of our service offerings and the products and markets to 
which we offer access. We may not be able to continue to offer the 
pricing, service, speed and reliability of order execution or the service, 
product and market breadth that clients desire. In addition, once our 
risk management consulting clients have become better educated 
with regard to sources of risk and the tools available to facilitate the 
management of this risk and we have provided them with recommended 
hedging strategies, they may no longer continue paying monthly fees 
for these services. Furthermore, our existing clients, including IRMP 
clients, are not generally obligated to use our services and can switch 
providers of clearing and execution services or decrease their trading 
activity conducted through us at any time. As a result, we may fail to 
retain existing clients or be unable to attract new clients. Our failure 
to maintain or attract clients could have an adverse effect on our 
business, financial condition and operating results.

We rely on relationships with introducing brokers for 
obtaining some of our clients. 
The failure to maintain and develop additional relationships with 
introducing brokers could adversely affect our business. We have 
relationships with introducing brokers who assist us in establishing 
new client relationships and provide marketing and client service 
functions for some of our clients. These introducing brokers receive 
compensation for introducing clients to us. Many of our relationships 
with introducing brokers are non-exclusive or may be canceled on 
relatively short notice. In addition, our introducing brokers have no 
obligation to provide new client relationships or minimum levels 
of transaction volume. Our failure to maintain these relationships 
with these introducing brokers, to develop new relationships with 
introducing brokers or the failure of these introducing brokers to 
establish and maintain client relationships would result in a loss of 
revenues, which could adversely affect our business.

Certain provisions of Delaware law and our charter 
may adversely affect the rights of holders of our 
common stock and make a takeover of us more 
difficult.
We are organized under the laws of the State of Delaware. Certain 
provisions of Delaware law may have the effect of delaying or preventing 
a change in control. In addition, certain provisions of our certificate 
of incorporation may have anti-takeover effects and may delay, defer 
or prevent a takeover attempt that a stockholder might consider in its 
best interest. Our certificate of incorporation authorizes the board to 
determine the terms of our unissued series of preferred stock and to 
fix the number of shares of any series of preferred stock without any 
vote or action by our stockholders. As a result, the board can authorize 
and issue shares of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights 
that could adversely affect the voting or other rights of holders of our 
common stock. In addition, the issuance of preferred stock may have 
the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, because the 
rights given to the holders of a series of preferred stock may prohibit 
a merger, reorganization, sale, liquidation or other extraordinary 
corporate transaction.

ITEM 1A Risk Factors

Our operations are subject to the political, legal and 
economic risks associated with politically unstable and 
less developed regions of the world, including the risk 
of war and other international conflicts and actions by 
governmental authorities, insurgent groups, terrorists 
and others. 
We are exposed to risks and uncertainties inherent in doing business 
in international markets. We may conduct business in countries that 
are the subject of actual or threatened war, terrorist activity, political 
instability, civil strife and other geopolitical uncertainty, economic and 
financial instability, unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, 
tariffs and other trade barriers, exchange rate fluctuations, applicable 
currency controls, the imposition of restrictions on currency conversion 
or the transfer of funds and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign 
operations, including reliance on local experts. As a result of these 
and other factors, the currencies of these countries may be unstable. 
Future instability in such currencies or the imposition of governmental 
or regulatory restrictions on such currencies or on business in such 
countries could impede our foreign business.

Our operations are required to comply with the laws 
and regulations of foreign governmental and regulatory 
authorities of each country in which we conduct 
business, and if we violate these regulations, we may be 
subject to significant penalties.
The financial services industry is subject to extensive laws, rules 
and regulations in every country in which we operate. Firms that 
engage in commodity futures brokerage, securities and derivatives 
trading and investment banking must comply with the laws, rules 
and regulations imposed by the governing country, state, regulatory 
bodies and self-regulatory bodies with governing authority over 
such activities. Such laws, rules and regulations cover all aspects of 
the financial services business, including, but not limited to, sales 
and trading methods, trade practices, use and safekeeping of clients’ 
funds and securities, capital structure, anti-money laundering and 
anti-bribery and corruption efforts, recordkeeping and the conduct 
of directors, officers and employees.
Each of our regulators supervises our business activities to monitor 
compliance with such laws, rules and regulations in the relevant 
jurisdiction. In addition, if there are instances in which our regulators 
question our compliance with laws, rules, and regulations, they may 
investigate the facts and circumstances to determine whether we have 
complied. At any moment in time, we may be subject to one or more 
such investigation or similar reviews. There can be no assurance that, 
in the future, the operations of our businesses will not violate such 
laws, rules, and regulations and that related investigations and similar 
reviews could result in adverse regulatory requirements, regulatory 
enforcement actions and/or fines.

Additional legislation, changes in rules, changes in the interpretation or 
enforcement of existing laws and rules, or the entering into businesses 
that subject us to new rules and regulations may directly affect our 
business, results of operations and financial condition.

Our operations are required to comply with U.S. laws 
and regulations applicable to companies conducting 
business internationally, and if we violate these laws 
and regulations, it could adversely affect our business 
and subject us to broader liability.
Our international business operations are subject to various anti-
corruption laws and regulations, including restrictions imposed by 
the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) and trade sanctions 
administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign 
Assets Control (“OFAC”). The FCPA is intended to prohibit bribery 
of foreign officials and requires companies whose securities are listed 
in the U.S. to keep books and records that accurately and fairly 
reflect those companies’ transactions and to devise and maintain an 
adequate system of internal accounting controls. OFAC administers 
and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign 
policy and national security goals against designated foreign states, 
organizations and individuals. Though we have policies in place designed 
to comply with applicable OFAC sanctions, rules and regulations as 
well as the FCPA and equivalent laws and rules of other jurisdictions, 
there can be no assurance that, in the future, the operations of our 
businesses will not violate these laws and regulations, and we could 
be exposed to claims for damages, financial penalties, reputational 
harm, incarceration of employees and restrictions on our operations 
and cash flows.

The U.K.’s proposed withdrawal from the European 
Union could have an adverse effect on our business and 
financial results.
On March 29, 2017, the U.K. government triggered the article 50 of 
the Treaty on European Union (“Brexit”). This officially confirmed 
the U.K.’s intention withdraw its membership to the E.U. and the 
start for a two year negotiation process where the U.K. and the 
E.U. need to agree the terms of the withdrawal and potentially give 
consideration to the future of the relationship between the parties. 
Current uncertainty over whether the U.K. will ultimately leave the 
E.U., as well as the final outcome of the negotiations between the 
U.K. and E.U., could have an adverse effect on our business and 
financial results. The long-term effects of Brexit will depend on the 
terms negotiated between the U.K. and the E.U., which may take 
years to complete. Our operations in the U.K. as well as our global 
operations could be impacted by the global economic uncertainty 
caused by Brexit or the actual withdrawal by the U.K. from the E.U. 
If we are unable to manage any of these risks effectively, our business 
could be adversely affected.

ITEM 3  Legal Proceedings

In addition to the matters discussed below, from time to time and 
in the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various legal 
actions and proceedings, including tort claims, contractual disputes, 
employment matters, workers’ compensation claims and collections. 
We carry insurance that provides protection against certain types of 
claims, up to the policy limits of our insurance. In the opinion of 
management, possible exposure from loss contingencies in excess of 
the amounts accrued, and in addition to the possible losses discussed 
below, is not material to our earnings, financial position or liquidity.
The following is a summary of a significant legal matter.

Sentinel Litigation
Prior to the July 1, 2015 merger into INTL FCStone Financial, our 
subsidiary, FCStone, LLC, had a portion of its excess segregated funds 
invested with Sentinel Management Group Inc. (“Sentinel”), a registered 
futures commission merchant (“FCM”) and an Illinois-based money 
manager that provided cash management services to other FCMs. 
In August 2007, Sentinel halted redemptions to customers and sold 
certain of the assets it managed to an unaffiliated third party at a 
significant discount. On August 17, 2007, subsequent to Sentinel’s sale 
of certain assets, Sentinel filed for bankruptcy protection. In aggregate, 

Patrocinio, Brazil; Campo Grande, Brazil; Asuncion and Ciudad 
del Este, Paraguay; Bogota, Colombia; London, United Kingdom; 
Dublin, Ireland; Dubai, United Arab Emirates; Singapore, Singapore; 
Beijing and Shanghai, China; Hong Kong; Toronto, Canada; Sydney, 
Australia; Luxembourg, Luxembourg; and Frankfurt, Germany. All of 
our offices and other principal business properties are leased, except for 
the space in Buenos Aires, which we own. We believe that our leased 
and owned facilities are adequate to meet anticipated requirements 
for our current lines of business.

$15.5 million of FCStone, LLC’s $21.9 million in invested funds 
were returned to it before and after Sentinel’s bankruptcy petition. 
A further amount of $2.0 million was held by the bankruptcy trustee 
in reserve in the name of FCStone, LLC.
In August 2008, the bankruptcy trustee of Sentinel filed adversary legal 
proceedings against FCStone, LLC and a number of other FCMs, seeking 
recovery of pre- and post-petition transfers totaling $15.5 million.
On April 23, 2018, following ten years of legal proceedings and a 
final ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh 
Circuit against the trustee and in favor of INTL FCStone Financial, 
the United States Supreme Court denied the trustee’s petition for 
writ of certiorari. Following this, on May 1, 2018, INTL FCStone 
Financial received funds from the reserve account in the amount 
of $2.0 million. This amount is presented in ‘other gains’ in the 
consolidated income statement.
Our assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that 
have been deemed reasonable by management, but that may later 
prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events 
and circumstances may occur that might cause us to change those 
estimates and assumptions.

ITEM 7  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of 

Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion should be read together with the Consolidated 
Financial Statements and Notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this 
Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain statements in “Management’s 
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of 
Operations” are forward-looking statements that involve known and 
unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our 
control. Words such as “may”, “will”, “should”, “would”, “anticipates”, 
“expects”, “intends”, “plans”, “believes”, “seeks”, “estimates” and 
similar expressions identify such forward-looking statements. The 
forward-looking statements contained herein are based on current 
expectations and entail various risks and uncertainties that could cause 

actual results to differ materially from those expressed in such forward-
looking statements. Factors that might cause such a difference include, 
among other things, those set forth under “Risk Factors” and those 
appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Readers are cautioned not 
to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which 
reflect management’s analysis only as of the date hereof. We assume 
no obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect 
actual results or changes in factors or assumptions affecting forward-
looking statements. Readers are cautioned that any forward-looking 
statements are not guarantees of future performance.

ITEM 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Recent Events Affecting the Financial Services Industry

The Dodd-Frank Act created a comprehensive new regulatory regime 
governing the over-the-counter (“OTC”) and listed derivatives markets. 
Most of the rules related to this regime have come into effect, however 
some important rules, such as those setting capital and margin 
requirements, have not been finalized or fully implemented. Effective 
September 2016, CFTC margin rules came into effect, imposing 
new requirements on registered swap dealers (such as our subsidiary, 
INTL FCStone Markets, LLC) and certain of their counterparties 
to exchange initial and variation margin, with an implementation 
period ending in September 2020. We will continue to monitor 
all applicable developments in the ongoing implementation of the 
Dodd-Frank Act. The legislation and implementing regulations affect 
not only us, but also our clients and counterparties.
The European Markets Infrastructure Regulation (“EMIR”) is the 
European regulations on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and 
trade repositories.  EMIR has been implemented across the European 
Economic Area member states. EMIR has imposed new requirements 
on our European entities, including (a) reporting derivatives to trade 
repositories, (b) setting up enhanced risk management procedures 
for OTC derivative transactions, (c) changes to our clearing account 

Recent Events Affecting the Company

During the week ended November 16, 2018, balances in approximately 
300 accounts of the FCM division of our wholly owned subsidiary, 
INTL FCStone Financial, declined below required maintenance 
margin levels, primarily as a result of significant price fluctuations 
in the natural gas markets. All positions in these accounts, which 
were managed by OptionSellers.com Inc. (“OptionSellers”), an 
independent Commodity Trading Advisor (“CTA”), were liquidated in 
accordance with the INTL FCStone Financial’s customer agreements 
and obligations under market regulation standards.
A CTA is by definition registered with the CFTC and a member of, 
and subject to audit by, the NFA. OptionSellers is registered under 
a CFTC Rule 4.7 exemption for “qualified eligible persons”, which 
requires the account holders authorizing OptionSellers to act as their 
CTA to meet or exceed certain minimum financial requirements. 
OptionSellers, in its role as a CTA, had been granted by each of 
its customers full discretionary authority to manage the trading in 
the customer accounts, while INTL FCStone Financial acted solely 
as the clearing firm in its role as the FCM, at all times meeting its 
obligations as the FCM to these accounts.
INTL FCStone Financial’s customer agreements conform to NFA 
guidance, disclose the risks to which account-holders are exposed, 
hold account-holders liable for all losses in their accounts, and 

Effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act

On December 22, 2017, the President of the United States (“U.S.”) 
signed and enacted into law H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax 
Reform”). Among the significant changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue 
Code, the Tax Reform lowers the U.S. federal corporate income tax 
rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. We will compute 
our income tax expense (benefit) for the September 30, 2018 tax year 

models and increased central counterparty margin requirements.  
Reporting requirements and most risk mitigation procedures were 
set at the end of 2013. Implementation of collateral obligations 
applicable to non-cleared OTC transactions came into force during 
2017. European Securities and Markets Authority (“ESMA”) is 
continuing to evaluate and set clearing obligations for certain OTC 
derivatives. INTL FCStone Ltd complies with the enacted provisions 
and will do so when pending EMIR provisions are finalized as relevant 
to its activities.
In addition to the EMIR, European Union financial market legislation 
Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (“MIFID”) II and Markets 
in Financial Instruments Regulation (“MIFIR”) took effect on 
January 3, 2018. Principal areas of impact related to these regulatory 
texts involve the emergence and oversight of organized trade facilities 
(“OTF’s”) for trading OTC non-equity products, client categorization, 
enhanced investor protection, conflicts of interest and execution 
policies, transparency obligations and extended transaction reporting 
requirements. We will continue to monitor all applicable regulatory 
developments.

obligate the account holders to reimburse INTL FCStone Financial 
for any account deficits in their accounts. INTL FCStone Financial 
continues to pursue collection of these receivables in the ordinary 
course of business. INTL FCStone Financial intends both to enforce 
and to defend its rights aggressively, and to claim interest and costs 
of collection where applicable. INTL FCStone Financial’s standard 
customer agreements provide for arbitration of disputes between parties.
As of December 10, 2018, the aggregate receivable from these customer 
accounts, net of collections and other allowable deductions thus far, 
is $31.3 million, with no individual account receivable exceeding 
$1.4 million. The exposure to losses from these customer accounts is 
not yet determinable, as collection efforts are in early stages, given the 
timing of events that lead to the receivable balances disclosed above. 
Depending on future collections and an assessment to be made under 
U.S. GAAP, any provisions for bad debts and actual losses ultimately 
may or may not be material to our financial results. We believe that 
these accounts receivable balances, along with possible exposure to 
losses from these customer accounts, will not impact our ability to 
comply with our ongoing liquidity, capital, and regulatory requirements.

using a U.S. statutory tax rate of 24.5%. The 21% U.S. statutory tax 
rate will apply to fiscal years ending September 30, 2019 and thereafter. 
The Tax Reform also imposes a one-time mandatory repatriation 
transition tax on previously untaxed accumulated and current earnings 
and profits (“E&P”) of certain of our foreign subsidiaries.

ITEM 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”), 
which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the Tax 
Reform. SAB 118 provides a measurement period that should not 
extend beyond one year from the Tax Reform enactment date for 
companies to complete the accounting under Accounting Standards 
Codification (“ASC”) 740 - Income Taxes (“ASC 740”). In accordance 
with SAB 118, a company must reflect the income tax effects of 
those aspects of the Tax Reform for which the accounting under 
ASC 740 is complete. To the extent that a company’s accounting 
for certain income tax effects of the Tax Reform is incomplete but 
it can determine a reasonable estimate, it must record a provisional 
estimate in the financial statements. If a company cannot determine 
a provisional estimate to be included in the financial statements, it 
should continue to apply ASC 740 based on the tax laws that were in 
effect immediately before the enactment of the Tax Reform.
Our accounting for certain elements of the Tax Reform is incomplete. 
However, as of September 30, 2018, our accounting for the 
remeasurement of the deferred tax assets and liabilities is complete. 
The remeasurement of the deferred tax assets and liabilities resulted 
in $8.6 million of tax expense, which increased the effective tax rate 
by 8.5% during the year ended September 30, 2018.
To determine the amount of the transition tax, we must determine, 
in addition to other factors, the amount of post 1986 E&P of the 
relevant subsidiaries, as well as the amount of non-U.S. income taxes 

Fiscal 2018 Highlights

•• Realized records in both operating revenues of $975.8 million and 
pre-tax income of $101.5 million.
•• Our subsidiary INTL FCStone DTVM Ltda. was granted a full-
service broker-dealer license in Brazil allowing expansion of its 
offering to its substantial existing institutional client base, as well as 
provide clients outside of Brazil greater access to that local market.
•• Our Global Payments business significantly enhanced its regulatory 
capability in Brazil with an FX Bank license, making the Company 
one of the few foreign companies with that status, which has led to 
an immediate three-fold increase in payments in that key market.

Executive Summary

paid on such earnings. We can make a reasonable estimate of the 
transition tax and recorded a provisional transition tax obligation of 
$11.2 million, which increased the effective tax rate by 11% during 
the year ended September 30, 2018. While we can make reasonable 
estimates for the deemed repatriation transition tax, the final tax 
impact may differ from these estimates, due to, among other things, 
changes in our interpretations and assumptions, additional guidance 
that may be issued by taxing authorities, and actions we may take.
The Tax Reform also establishes new tax laws that will affect the 
fiscal year ending September 30, 2019, including, but not limited to, 
(1) elimination of the corporate alternative minimum tax, (2) a new 
provision designed to tax global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI), 
(3) limitations on the utilization of net operating losses incurred in tax 
years beginning after September 30, 2018 to 80% of taxable income 
per tax year, (4) the creation of the base erosion anti-abuse tax (BEAT), 
(5) a general elimination of U.S. federal income taxes on dividends 
from foreign subsidiaries, and (6) limitations on the deductibility of 
interest expense and certain executive compensation. The Company 
has not yet determined the potential tax impact of provisions that are 
not yet effective, such as GILTI, BEAT, and the elimination of U.S. 
tax on dividends of future foreign earnings.  The Company expects 
to make the policy election to treat GILTI as a period expense in the 
fiscal year ending September 30, 2019.

•• Agreed to purchase Carl Kliem S.A., an independent inter-dealer 
broker based in Luxembourg, which upon closing will provide a 
strong European client base and a European Union based footprint 
for us, post Brexit. 
•• Acquired the fully accredited SWIFT Service Bureau from 
PayCommerce in the fourth quarter, which will enable the Company 
to act as a SWIFT Service Bureau for its more than 300 correspondent 
clearing banks. 

We achieved strong operating revenue growth of 24%, or $191.8 million, 
to $975.8 million in fiscal 2018 compared to the prior year. The 
return of periods of market volatility in our key markets resulted 
in increased client activity and a widening of spreads in fiscal 2018, 
which combined with increases in short term interest rates and average 
client balances resulted in record operating revenues in all five of our 
reporting segments.
Overall segment income increased 55%, with Commercial Hedging 
and Clearing & Execution Services (“CES”) adding $23.6 million 
and $17.9 million, respectively. In addition, our Global Payments 
segment added $9.2 million, while the Physical Commodities segment 
increased segment income by $48.0 million versus the prior year. 
These increases were modestly offset by a $5.8 million decline in 
Securities segment income.

Commercial Hedging segment income increased 32%, to $96.4 million, 
primarily as a result of strong growth in both exchange-traded and 
OTC revenues as well as a $9.5 million increase in interest income. 
A $1.3 million increase in interest expense was partially offset by a 
$0.7 million decline in non-variable direct expenses compared to 
the prior year.
CES segment income increased 59%, to $48.3 million, primarily 
as a result of the increase in operating revenues, most notably a 
60% increase in our Exchange-Traded Futures & Options business, 
driven by a 35% increase in exchange-traded volumes as well as an 
$11.5 million increase in interest income. In addition, cost savings 
initiatives in our FX Prime Brokerage and Correspondent Clearing 
businesses resulted in a $4.1 million decline in non-variable direct 
expenses in this segment.

ITEM 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Global Payments segment income increased 18%, to $59.8 million, 
primarily as a result of the increase in operating revenues, driven 
by a 13% increase in the average revenue per trade versus the prior 
year period. In addition, introducing broker commissions declined 
$2.6 million versus the prior year, which was partially offset by a 
$1.4 million increase in non-variable direct expenses.
Segment income in Physical Commodities was $16.6 million in fiscal 
2018 compared to a segment loss of $31.4 million in the prior year. 
Segment income in the prior year includes a $47.0 million charge to 
earnings for an allowance for doubtful accounts recorded in the fourth 
quarter of 2017 related to our physical coal business, discussed further 
below. Fiscal 2018 segment income includes a related $1.0 million 
charge to earnings, recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 upon 
our exit of the physical coal business.
While operating revenues in our Securities segment increased 29%, 
segment income declined $5.8 million, impacted by weaker performance 
in our domestic institutional fixed income business including a 
$17.8 million increase in interest expense which more than offset the 
growth in operating revenues in that business. In addition, difficult 
market conditions led to a decline in performance in our Argentinian 
operations versus the prior year. Also, the prior year period included a 
$2.5 million realized gain on the sale of exchange shares in Argentina.
On the expense side, we continue to focus on maintaining our variable 
cost model and limiting the growth of our non-variable expenses. To 
that end, variable expenses were 61% of total expenses in fiscal 2018 
compared to 53% in the prior year period. Non-variable expenses 
declined $30.7 million versus the prior year, however excluding the bad 
debt on physical coal, non-variable expenses increased $15.3 million 
year-over-year.
The fiscal 2018 results include $5.5 million in operating revenues, 
presented in ‘trading gains, net’, related to economic hedges in place 
against the effect of the devaluation of the Argentine peso on our 
Argentine operations. The Argentine peso has historically served as 
our functional currency in the Argentine operations, and as such the 
revaluation of the net assets of our Argentine subsidiaries was recorded 
as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net in 
the consolidated balance sheets. Recently, the Argentinian economy 
was determined to be highly inflationary and as such, beginning 
July 1, 2018, the functional currency for our Argentine subsidiaries 
is the U.S. dollar and prospectively the corresponding revaluations of 
the net assets of these subsidiaries are recorded in earnings each quarter 
in the consolidated income statements while the highly inflationary 
designation continues.
Finally, during fiscal 2018 we recorded a $2.0 million gain related to 
a judgment received in final settlement of our claim in the Sentinel 

Selected Summary Financial Information

Management Group Inc. bankruptcy proceeding. Please see Note  11 - 
Commitments and Contingencies for additional information on the 
Sentinel litigation.
Net income increased $49.1 million to $55.5 million in fiscal 2018 
compared to fiscal 2017, primarily related to the growth in operating 
revenues as well as the reduction in bad debt related to physical coal 
discussed below. Net income in fiscal 2018 includes an estimated one-
time income tax charge of $19.8 million related to the enactment of 
the Tax Reform. This charge is related to the re-measurement of our 
deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from a lower U.S. corporate 
tax rate and shift to a territorial tax regime as well as a charge related to 
the deemed repatriation of unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries. 
Excluding the impact of Tax Reform, net income in fiscal 2018, would 
have been $75.3 million.

Bad Debt on Physical Coal
During the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 
2017, we recorded charges to earnings of $1.0 million and $47.0 million, 
respectively, to record an allowance for doubtful accounts related to a 
bad debt incurred in our physical coal business, conducted solely in 
our Singapore subsidiary, INTL Asia Pte. Ltd., with a coal supplier. 
Components of the bad debt on physical coal include allowances on 
amounts due to us from our supplier related to: coal paid for but 
not delivered to clients; reimbursement of demurrage claims, dead 
freight and other charges paid and payable by INTL Asia Pte. Ltd. to 
its clients; reimbursement due for deficiencies in the quality of coal 
delivered to clients; and losses incurred related to the cancellation of 
open sales contracts.
We received an acknowledgment of debt and a note from the supplier, 
however, there is substantial uncertainty as to whether the supplier 
will be able to meet its financial obligations to us and as to the timing 
of any recovery. We continue to pursue all legal avenues available 
to us regarding this matter. We have presented the bad debt on 
physical coal separately as a component of income from operations 
in our consolidated income statements. We have completed our exit 
of the physical coal business. INTL Asia Pte. Ltd. was recapitalized 
following the bad debt in order for its other businesses to operate 
in normal course.
On November 22, 2018, we reached a settlement with a client, paying 
$5.1 million related to demurrage, dead freight, and other penalty 
charges regarding coal supplied during fiscal 2017. The settlement 
amount paid was less than the accrued liability for the transactions 
recorded during fiscal 2017, and accordingly we will record a recovery 
on the bad debt on physical coal of $1.7 million in the three months 
ending December 31, 2018.

Operating Revenues

Year Ended September 30, 2018 Compared to Year 
Ended September 30, 2017
Operating revenues increased 24% to a record $975.8 million in fiscal 
2018 compared to $784.0 million in the prior year. All segments of our 
business achieved growth in operating revenues versus the prior year, 
with the largest growth coming in our CES segment which added 
$72.6 million in operating revenues. In addition, Commercial Hedging 
segment operating revenues increased $42.1 million, while operating 
revenues in our Securities segment added $44.5 million versus the 
prior year. Our Physical Commodities and Global Payment segments 
grew $12.1 million and $10.0 million, respectively.
Operating revenues for the prior year included a $5.9 million pre-tax 
unrealized loss on interest rate swaps and U.S. Treasury notes held 
as part of our interest rate management strategy, while fiscal 2018 

includes no unrealized gain/losses on this program as all interest rate 
swaps and U.S. Treasury notes were liquidated during fiscal 2017. 
On a segment basis, these unrealized losses were reported in the 
Corporate unallocated segment, while the amortized earnings on 
these investments were included in the Commercial Hedging and 
CES segments.
Operating revenues in our CES segment increased 28% to 
$332.4 million in fiscal 2018, primarily as a result of 60% growth 
in Exchange-Traded Futures & Options revenues, to $183.4 million, 
driven by increases in contract volumes, the average rate per contract 
earned and a $11.6 million, or 138%, increase in interest income. 
Our Correspondent Clearing business added $2.1 million versus the 
prior year, while the Derivative Voice Brokerage and Independent 
Wealth Management businesses added $1.5 million and $1.0 million 
in operating revenues, respectively compared to the prior year. These 
increases were modestly offset by a $0.5 million decline in our FX Prime 
Brokerage business.

ITEM 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Operating revenues in Commercial Hedging increased 17% in fiscal 
2018 to $286.7 million, as exchange-traded revenues increased 
$14.4 million and OTC revenues increased $17.6 million. Client 
exchange-traded volumes increased 16%, driven by increased activity 
from clients in the domestic grain and energy and renewable fuels 
markets, as well as an increase in exchange-traded revenues from 
omnibus relationships introduced by our commercial hedging 
employees. OTC revenues increased as a result of both a 12% increase 
in OTC volumes and a 10% increase in the average rate per contract 
compared to the prior year. These increases were driven by increased 
activity from Brazilian agricultural clients as well as increased activity 
in food service, dairy and soft commodity markets. In addition, 
interest income in this segment increased $9.5 million, or 71%, as 
a result of an increase in short term interest rates on relatively flat 
average client equity balances.
Operating revenues in our Global Payments segment increased 11% 
in fiscal 2018 to a record $99.2 million, as a result of a 13% increase 
in the average revenue per trade. The number of global payments 
made declined 1% as certain commercial clients switched from doing 
individual high volume but low value payments through our platform, 
to doing aggregated higher value funding payments on our platform. 
Irrespective of this, we experienced increased volumes of payments 
made by financial institutions, governmental and non-governmental 
organizations and other commercial clients versus the prior year.
Our Physical Commodity segment operating revenues increased 27% 
to $56.9 million in fiscal 2018, primarily as a result of an $8.3 million 
increase in Physical Ag & Energy operating revenues as well as a 
$3.8 million increase in Precious Metals operating revenues.
Operating revenues in our Securities segment increased 29% to 
$196.2 million in fiscal 2018 compared to the prior year. Our Equity 
Capital Markets business, which we formerly referred to as Equity 
Market-Making, increased 64%, to $93.2 million, as the gross dollar 
volume traded increased 35% as a result of increased market volatility, 
the on-boarding of new clients and increased market share. Operating 
revenues in our Debt Capital Markets business, which now includes 
both our Debt Trading and Investment Banking businesses discussed 
in prior filings, increased 15%, to $95.3 million versus the prior 
year, with increases in activity in our municipal securities business 
as well as an increase in interest income in our domestic institutional 
fixed income business, partially offset by lower operating revenues 
in Argentina. The prior year period included a $2.5 million realized 
gain on the sale of exchange shares in Argentina. Asset Management 
operating revenues declined 35% to $7.7 million in fiscal 2018, as 
the average assets under management declined 25%. Our Securities 
segment operating revenues benefited from a $26.7 million increase in 
interest income, primarily in our domestic institutional fixed income 
and securities lending activities.
Overall interest income increased $53.6 million to $123.3 million in 
fiscal 2018 compared to prior year, primarily driven by the $26.7 million 
increase in our Securities segment interest income. In addition, average 
client equity in the Financial Ag & Energy and Exchange-Traded 
Futures & Options components of our Commercial Hedging and CES 
segments increased 8% to $2.2 billion in fiscal 2018 compared to the 
prior year, which combined with an increase in short term interest rates 
resulted in an aggregate $21.1 million increase in interest income in 
these businesses. Included in interest income in the prior year period 
was a $4.8 million unrealized loss on U.S. Treasury notes held as part 
of our interest rate management strategy.

Finally, operating revenues for fiscal 2018 include gains of $5.5 million 
related to economic hedges in place against the effect of the devaluation 
of the Argentina Peso on our Argentine operations, reported in the 
Corporate unallocated segment.
See Segment Information below for additional information on activity 
in each of the segments.

Year Ended September 30, 2017 Compared to Year 
Ended September 30, 2016
Operating revenues increased 17% to $784.0 million in fiscal 2017 
compared to $671.0 million in the prior year. Operating revenue 
growth was driven by a $108.7 million increase in our CES segment, 
primarily as a result of incremental operating revenues from our recent 
acquisitions. In addition, Global Payments and Commercial Hedging 
operating revenues increased $16.0 million and $8.5 million, respectively. 
Physical Commodities segment operating revenues increased $8.2 million 
versus the prior year. Offsetting this revenue growth was a $23.5 million 
decline in operating revenues within our Securities segment.
Operating revenues for fiscal 2017 included a $5.9 million pre-tax 
unrealized loss on interest rate swaps and U.S. Treasury notes held as 
part of our interest rate management strategy. The prior year period 
included a $0.7 million pre-tax unrealized loss on interest rate swaps 
and U.S. Treasury notes held as part of our interest rate management 
strategy. On a segment basis, these unrealized losses were reported in 
the Corporate unallocated segment, while the amortized earnings on 
these investments were included in the Commercial Hedging and CES 
segments. During fiscal 2017, we liquidated our interest rate swap 
and U.S. Treasury note positions, held as part of the strategy, due to 
scheduled maturities as well as the close-outs of profitable positions 
as we determined there was no longer a sufficient interest rate spread 
between short-term and medium term rates.
Operating revenues in our CES segment increased 72% to $259.8 million 
in fiscal 2017, primarily as a result of the acquisition of the Sterne 
Agee Correspondent Clearing and Independent Wealth Management 
businesses at the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, which 
added an incremental $75.3 million in operating revenues in fiscal 
2018. Also contributing to the revenue growth was the acquisition 
of ICAP plc’s London-based EMEA oil voice brokerage business, at 
the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2017, which contributed 
$26.7 million to fiscal 2018 operating revenues. The Exchange-Traded 
Futures & Options business added $8.8 million in operating revenues 
primarily as a result of an increase in the average rate per contract, 
while the FX Prime Brokerage business declined $2.3 million, despite 
a 7% increase in client volumes as spreads narrowed in this business.
Operating revenues in our Global Payments segment increased 22% 
in fiscal 2017 to $89.2 million, as a result of a 46% increase in the 
number of global payments made which was partially offset by a 
narrowing of spreads in this business due to an increase in volume 
of smaller transactions from financial institutions.
Operating revenues in Commercial Hedging increased 4% in fiscal 
2017 to $244.6 million, primarily driven by a $4.8 million increase 
in interest income. In addition, exchange-traded revenues increased 
$4.3 million, while OTC revenues declined $1.5 million. An increase 
in agricultural and energy and renewable fuels revenues drove the 
increase in exchange-traded revenues.

Our Physical Commodity segment operating revenues increased 22% 
to $44.8 million, as a result of a $6.0 million increase in Physical Ag & 
Energy operating revenues, while Precious Metals added $2.2 million 
in operating revenues.
Operating revenues in our Securities segment declined 13% to 
$151.7 million in fiscal 2017 compared to the prior year. The Debt 
Capital Markets and Asset Management businesses declined $11.5 and 
$6.3 million, respectively, as the prior year period reflected strong 
performance in our Argentine operations in these businesses following 
the devaluation of the Argentine Peso in December 2015. Investment 
Banking, now included within Debt Capital Markets, had a decline 
in operating revenues of $1.0 million due both to weaker results in 
Argentina and management’s decision to exit our domestic investment 
banking business. In addition, Equity Capital Markets operating 
revenues declined $5.7 million as a result of a narrowing of spreads 
due to lower market volatility.
Overall interest income increased $14.5 million to $69.7 million in 
fiscal 2017 compared to prior year, primarily driven a $6.4 million 
increase in Debt Capital Markets interest income. In addition, average 
client equity in the Financial Ag & Energy and Exchange-Traded 
Futures & Options components of our Commercial Hedging and 
CES segments increased 7% to $2.0 billion in fiscal 2018 compared to 
the prior year, which combined with an increase in short term interest 
rates resulted in an aggregate $8.1 million increase in interest income 
in these businesses. In addition, the acquisition of the Sterne Agee 
Correspondent Clearing business added an incremental $3.9 million 
in interest income. These increases in interest income were partially 
offset by a $5.5 million decline in the mark-to-market valuation on 
U.S. Treasury notes.

Interest and Transactional Expenses

Year Ended September 30, 2018 Compared to Year 
Ended September 30, 2017
Transaction-based clearing expenses: Transaction-based clearing 
expenses increased 32% to $179.7 million in fiscal 2018 compared to 
$136.3 million in fiscal 2017, and were 18% of operating revenues in 
fiscal 2018 compared to 17% in fiscal 2017. The increase in expense 
is primarily related to higher volumes in our Financial Ag & Energy, 
Exchange-Traded Futures & Options and Equity Capital Markets 
components, partially offset by lower costs in our LME Metals, FX 
Prime Brokerage and Correspondent Clearing components.
Introducing broker commissions: Introducing broker commissions 
increased 18% to $133.8 million in fiscal 2018 compared to 
$113.0 million in fiscal 2017, and were 14% of operating revenues 
in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017. The increase in expense is primarily 
due to increased business activity and improved performance in our 
Exchange-Traded Futures & Options and Financial Ag & Energy 
components, partially offset by lower costs in Global Payments and 
Equity Capital Markets.
Interest expense: Interest expense increased 92% to $80.7 million 
in fiscal 2018 compared to $42.1 million in fiscal 2017. During 
fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, interest expense directly attributable to 

trading activities, including interest on short-term financing facilities 
of subsidiaries, was $70.5 million and $32.7 million, respectively, 
and interest expense related to corporate funding purposes was 
$10.2 million and $9.4 million, respectively.
The increase in interest expense is primarily related to the trading 
activities of our institutional dealer in fixed income securities, which 
resulted in higher interest expense of $17.8 million, and the increased 
activity of our securities lending business, started up during fiscal 2017 
in our Equity Capital Markets component, which resulted in higher 
interest expense of $11.9 million. Also, an increase in short-term rates 
resulted in higher costs in our Exchange-Traded Futures & Options and 
Financial Ag & Energy components. Additionally, higher short-term 
rates along with higher average borrowings outstanding on our physical 
commodities financing facilities resulted in increased expense.

Year Ended September 30, 2017 Compared to Year 
Ended September 30, 2016
Transaction-based clearing expenses: Transaction-based clearing 
expenses increased 5% to $136.3 million in fiscal 2017 compared to 
$129.9 million in fiscal 2016, and were 17% of operating revenues in 
fiscal 2017 compared to 19% in fiscal 2016. The increase in expense 
is primarily related to the activity of the Sterne Agee correspondent 
clearing and independent wealth management businesses, acquired 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and thus only three months 
of expenses were included in fiscal 2016, resulting in higher expense 
of $4.7 million. Additionally, increased activity across our Exchange-
Traded Futures & Options and Financial Ag & Energy components 
contributed to the higher costs, partially offset by lower ADR conversion 
fees in our Equity Capital Markets component and lower Debt Capital 
Markets transactional fees. The decrease in transaction-based clearing 
expenses as a percentage of operating revenue is primarily related to 
the impact of the incremental revenues from these acquired businesses, 
as well as the acquired oil voice brokerage business.
Introducing broker commissions: Introducing broker commissions 
increased 64% to $113.0 million in fiscal 2017 compared to 
$68.9 million in fiscal 2016, and were 14% of operating revenues in 
fiscal 2017 compared to 10% in fiscal 2016. The increase in expense 
is primarily related to the activity of the Sterne Agee independent 
wealth management business, acquired during the fourth quarter of 
fiscal 2016 and thus only three months of expenses were included 
in fiscal 2016, resulting in higher expense of $42.1 million. Also, we 
experienced an increase in introducing broker commissions in our 
Exchange-Traded Futures & Options and Financial Ag & Energy 
components, partially offset by decreased in our Debt Capital Markets 
business in Argentina, and lower broker commissions in our Investment 
Banking component as we exited the domestic investment banking 
business during fiscal 2016.
Interest expense: Interest expense increased 49% to $42.1 million 
in fiscal 2017 compared to $28.3 million in fiscal 2016. During 
fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, interest expense directly attributable to 
trading activities, including interest on short-term financing facilities 
of subsidiaries, was $32.7 million and $19.5 million, respectively, and 
interest expense related to corporate funding purposes was $9.4 million 
and $8.8 million, respectively.

ITEM 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The increase in interest expense is primarily related to the trading 
activities of our institutional dealer in fixed income securities, which 
resulted in higher interest expense of $8.0 million. Additionally, 
increased credit line capacity and higher average borrowings outstanding 
on our corporate credit facility, available for working capital needs, 
and our physical commodity financing facility resulted in increased 
expense. Also, an increase in short-term rates resulted in higher costs 
in our Exchange-Traded Futures & Options component, as well as 
incremental interest related to our stock lending business started up 
during fiscal 2017 in our Equity Capital Markets component.

Net Operating Revenues
Net operating revenues is one of the key measures used by management 
to assess the performance of our operating segments. Net operating 
revenue is calculated as operating revenue less transaction-based clearing 
expenses, introducing broker commissions and interest expense. 
Transaction-based clearing expenses represent variable expenses paid 

to executing brokers, exchanges, clearing organizations and banks in 
relation to our transactional volumes. Introducing broker commissions 
include commission paid to non-employee third parties that have 
introduced clients to us. Net operating revenues represent revenues 
available to pay variable compensation to risk management consultants 
and traders and direct non-variable expenses, as well as variable and 
non-variable expenses of operational and administrative employees.

Year Ended September 30, 2018 Compared to Year 
Ended September 30, 2017
Net operating revenues increased $89.0 million, or 18%, to 
$581.6 million in fiscal 2018 compared to $492.6 million in fiscal 2017.

Year Ended September 30, 2017 Compared to Year 
Ended September 30, 2016
Net operating revenues increased $48.7 million, or 11%, to 
$492.6 million in fiscal 2017 compared to $443.9 million in fiscal 2016.

Ended September 30, 2017
Compensation and Other Expenses: Compensation and other 
expenses increased $4.7 million, or 1%, to $482.1 million in fiscal 
2018 compared to $477.4 million in fiscal 2017.
Compensation and Benefits: Total compensation and benefits 
expenses increased 14% to $337.7 million in fiscal 2018 compared 
to $295.7 million in fiscal 2017. Total compensation and benefits 
were 35% of operating revenues in fiscal 2018 compared to 38% of 
operating revenues in fiscal 2017. The variable portion of compensation 
and benefits increased 26% to $174.1 million in fiscal 2018 compared 
to $138.7 million in fiscal 2017. Variable compensation and benefits 
were 30% of net operating revenues in fiscal 2018 compared to 28% 

in fiscal 2017. Administrative, centralized operations and executive 
incentive compensation was $24.6 million in fiscal 2018 compared to 
$16.7 million in fiscal 2017, primarily due to current year performance, 
as there was no executive team incentive compensation in fiscal 2017 
due to the bad debt on physical coal.
The fixed portion of compensation and benefits increased 4% to 
$163.6 million in fiscal 2018 compared to $157.0 million in fiscal 
2017. Non-variable salaries increased $3.2 million, or 3%, primarily 
across operations and administrative areas. Contract labor costs increased 
$0.8 million. Employee benefits, excluding share-based compensation, 
increased $4.1 million in fiscal 2018, primarily related to higher accruals 
for executive management related to a cash-based long-term incentive 
plan and higher employer payroll and retirement costs. Share-based 
compensation is a component of the fixed portion, and includes stock

ITEM 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

option and restricted stock expense. Share-based compensation was 
$6.6 million in fiscal 2018 compared to $6.3 million in fiscal 2017. 
The number of employees increased 6% to 1,701 at the end of fiscal 
2018 compared to 1,607 at the end of fiscal 2017.
Other Non-Compensation Expenses: Other non-compensation 
expenses decreased by 21% to $144.4 million in fiscal 2018 compared 
to $181.7 million in fiscal 2017. Professional fees increased 19%, 
primarily due to higher legal fees related to the bad debt on physical 
coal and higher consulting fees primarily related to administrative 
system evaluations. Depreciation and amortization increased primarily 
due to depreciation of the new trading system for certain OTC 
commodities business activities, placed in service during the fourth 
quarter of fiscal 2017.
Excluding the bad debt on physical coal discussed below, bad debts 
decreased $1.2 million year-over-year. During fiscal 2018, bad debts 
were $3.1 million, primarily related to $2.8 million of agricultural 
OTC client account deficits in our Commercial Hedging segment 
and $0.4 million of exchange-traded client account deficits in our 
Clearing & Execution Services segment. During fiscal 2017, bad debts 
were $4.3 million, primarily related to $3.9 million in LME Metals 
client deficits in our Commercial Hedging segment and $0.2 million 
of uncollectible client receivables in our Physical Ag & Energy and 
Derivative Voice Brokerage components.
Bad Debt on Physical Coal: During the first quarter of fiscal 2018 
and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we recorded charges to earnings 
of $1.0 million and $47.0 million, respectively, to record an allowance 
for doubtful accounts related to the bad debt incurred in our physical 
coal business, conducted solely in our Singapore subsidiary, INTL 
Asia Pte. Ltd., with a coal supplier. We have completed our exit of 
the physical coal business.

Other Gains
The fiscal 2018 results include a contingent gain of $2.0 million 
related to a judgment received in final settlement of our claim in the 
Sentinel Management Group Inc. bankruptcy proceeding. Please see 
Note 11 - Commitments and Contingencies for additional information 
on the Sentinel litigation.

Income Taxes
The effective income tax rate on income from operations was 45% 
in fiscal 2018 compared to 58% in fiscal 2017. The discrete expense 
of $19.8 million related to the Tax Reform increased the effective 
tax rate by 20%. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 excluding the 
impacts of Tax reform was 26%. The effective tax rate decreased 0.5% 
due to excess tax benefits on share-based compensation recognized 
during the period related to the adoption of ASU 2016-09. Our 
effective income tax rate during fiscal 2017 was significantly higher 
than the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to the bad debt 
on our physical coal business in Singapore being taxed at a lower 
rate resulting in less of a benefit to offset taxable earnings in other 
jurisdictions. Excluding the impact of the bad debt on physical coal, 
our effective tax rates was 20.7% in fiscal 2017. The effective income 
tax rate can vary from period to period depending on, among other 
factors, the geographic and business mix of our earnings.

Year Ended September 30, 2017 Compared to Year 
Ended September 30, 2016
Compensation and Other Expenses: Compensation and other 
expenses increased $100.0 million, or 26%, to $477.4 million in 
fiscal 2017 compared to $377.4 million in fiscal 2016.
Compensation and Benefits: Total compensation and benefits 
expenses increased 12% to $295.7 million in fiscal 2017 compared 
to $263.9 million in fiscal 2016. Total compensation and benefits 
were 38% of operating revenues in fiscal 2017 compared to 39% of 
operating revenues in fiscal 2016. The variable portion of compensation 
and benefits increased 1% to $138.7 million in fiscal 2017 compared 
to $137.4 million in fiscal 2016. Variable compensation and benefits 
were 28% of net operating revenues in fiscal 2017 compared to 31% 
in fiscal 2016. Administrative, centralized operations and executive 
incentive compensation was $16.7 million in fiscal 2017 compared 
to $28.7 million in fiscal 2016, primarily due to the lower current 
year performance impacting executive incentive compensation, as 
well as declines among certain business lines.
The fixed portion of compensation and benefits increased 24% to 
$157.0 million in fiscal 2017 compared to $126.5 million in fiscal 
2016. Non-variable salaries increased $20.2 million, or 22%, primarily 
due to the activity of the Sterne Agee correspondent clearing and 
independent wealth management businesses, acquired during the 
fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and thus only three months of expenses 
were included in fiscal 2016, and our acquisition of ICAP plc’s 
London-based EMEA oil voice brokerage business, resulting in 
an aggregate addition of $12.5 million. Additionally, we increased 
headcount across several growing business lines as well as across several 
administrative departments. Employee benefits, excluding share-based 
compensation, increased $8.0 million in fiscal 2017, primarily due 
to higher employer payroll, health care and retirement costs, as well 
as higher temporary personnel costs. Share-based compensation is 
a component of the fixed portion, and includes stock option and 
restricted stock expense. Share-based compensation was $6.3 million 
in fiscal 2017 compared to $5.1 million in fiscal 2016. The number of 
employees increased 10% to 1,607 at the end of fiscal 2017 compared 
to 1,464 at the end of fiscal 2016.
Other Non-Compensation Expenses: Other non-compensation 
expenses increased by 60% to $181.7 million in fiscal 2017 compared 
to $113.5 million in fiscal 2016. Communication and data services 
expenses increased $6.7 million, primarily related to incremental 
trade systems and market information costs associated with the 
acquired businesses discussed above. Occupancy and equipment rental 
increased $1.9 million, primarily as a result of the incremental costs 
from the leased office space of the acquired Sterne Agee correspondent 
clearing and independent wealth management businesses. Travel and 
business development fees increased $1.8 million, primarily related 
to incremental costs from the acquired businesses, as well as higher 
costs across certain administrative departments. Depreciation and 
amortization increased $1.6 million, primarily related to the increase 
in the amortization of intangible assets identified as part of our recent 
acquisition of ICAP plc’s London-based EMEA oil voice brokerage 
business. Other expense increased $8.1 million, primarily due to 
incremental costs from our acquisitions discussed above, including 
non-trading hardware and software licensing costs, insurance, and 
office expenses. Additionally, we experienced greater losses from trade 
errors in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016.

ITEM 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Excluding the bad debt on physical coal discussed below, bad debts 
decreased $0.1 million year-over-year. During fiscal 2017, bad debts 
were $4.3 million, primarily related to $3.9 million in LME Metals 
client deficits in our Commercial Hedging segment and $0.2 million 
of uncollectible client receivables in our Physical Ag & Energy and 
Derivative Voice Brokerage components. During fiscal 2016, bad debts 
were $4.4 million, primarily related to $3.6 million of client deficits in 
our Commercial Hedging segment, $0.4 million of uncollectible client 
receivables in our Physical Ag & Energy component and $0.4 million 
of uncollectible service fees and notes in our Securities segment.
Bad Debt on Physical Coal: During the fourth quarter of fiscal 
2017, we recorded a charge to earnings of $47.0 million, to record 
an allowance for doubtful accounts related to a bad debt incurred 
in our physical coal business, conducted solely in our Singapore 
subsidiary, INTL Asia Pte. Ltd., with a coal supplier. Components 
of the bad debt on physical coal include allowances on amounts due 
to us from our supplier related to: coal paid for but not delivered to 
clients; reimbursement of demurrage claims, dead freight and other 
charges paid by INTL Asia Pte. Ltd. to its clients; reimbursement due 
for deficiencies in the quality of coal delivered to clients; and losses 
incurred related to the cancellation of open sales contracts.
We purchased coal delivered onto barges and paid 80% of the value 
against bills of lading and purchase invoices, with the remaining 20% 
payable following inspection upon delivery to clients’ vessels. We took 
title of the coal when it was loaded onto barges and maintained title 
until it was offloaded onto clients’ vessels. The logistics related to the 
delivery of coal to the clients’ vessels was out-sourced to our coal supplier, 
and we determined that certain purchased coal was not delivered to 
our clients’ vessels during the fourth quarter ended September 30, 
2017. Furthermore, we determined that our supplier was unable to 
deliver such purchased coal to our clients. Demurrage claims, dead 
freight, and other penalty charges paid and payable by INTL Asia Pte. 
Ltd. to its clients were due to be reimbursed by our supplier based 
on transaction agreements with our supplier. Subsequent to the end 
of the fourth quarter ended September 30, 2017, we determined our 
supplier was unable to make this reimbursement.
We received an acknowledgment of debt and a note from the supplier 
in our first quarter ending December 31, 2017. However, there is 
substantial uncertainty as to whether the supplier will be able to meet 
its financial obligations to us and as to the timing of any recovery. 
We are continuing our investigation into this matter and will pursue 
all legal avenues available to us. We have presented the bad debt on 
physical coal separately as a component of income from operations 
in our consolidated income statements.

We exited the physical coal business. All remaining open sales contracts 
have been canceled. There were no long-lived or intangible assets 
related to the physical coal business, and accordingly no impairment 
charges were recorded. The loss has not adversely affected our on-
going profitability as the physical coal business had not contributed 
significantly to income from operations. Additional exit costs were 
not material to our consolidated financial statements. INTL Asia Pte. 
Ltd. was recapitalized following the bad debt in order for its other 
businesses to operate in normal course.
On November 22, 2018, we reached a settlement with a client, paying 
$5.1 million related to demurrage, dead freight, and other penalty 
charges regarding coal supplied during fiscal 2017. The settlement 
amount paid was less than the accrued liability for the transactions 
recorded during fiscal 2017, and accordingly we will record a recovery 
on the bad debt on physical coal of $1.7 million in the three months 
ending December 31, 2018.
Other Gains: In the fiscal fourth quarter of 2016, we acquired the 
correspondent securities clearing and independent wealth management 
businesses of Sterne Agee. The purchase price of $45.0 million 
represented a discount to the preliminary allocation of fair value to 
the net assets of the Sterne entities. The $6.2 million discount in the 
purchase price compared to the preliminary allocation of fair value 
to the net assets at closing was reflected as an “other gain” in the 
Consolidated Income Statement for fiscal 2016.
Income Taxes: The effective income tax rate on income from operations 
was 58% in fiscal 2017 compared to 25% in fiscal 2016. Our effective 
income tax rate during fiscal 2017 was significantly higher than the 
U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to the bad debt on our physical 
coal business in Singapore being taxed at a lower rate resulting in less 
of a benefit to offset taxable earnings in other jurisdictions. Excluding 
the impact of the bad debt on physical coal, our effective tax rates 
was 20.7% in fiscal 2017. Our effective income tax rate in fiscal 
2016 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to 
a higher mix of earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions 
as well as the impact of the bargain purchase gain on the acquired 
businesses from Sterne Agee. The effective income tax rate can vary 
from period to period depending on, among other factors, the 
geographic and business mix of our earnings. Generally, when the 
percentage of pretax earnings generated from the U.S. increases, our 
effective income tax rate increases.

Total unallocated costs and other expenses increased $24.9 million 
to $162.2 million in fiscal 2018 compared to $137.3 million in fiscal 
2017. Compensation and benefits increased $11.8 million, or 16% to 
$86.3 million in fiscal 2018 compared to $74.5 million in fiscal 2017.
During fiscal 2018, the increase in compensation and benefits is 
primarily related to accruals for executive management for incentives 
based on current year performance, as well as a cash-based long-term 
incentive plan. Additionally, there were no executive team incentive 
compensation in fiscal 2017 due to the bad debt on physical coal. 
The increase in other expense is primarily related to our internal bi-
annual global sales meeting held during January 2018.

Year Ended September 30, 2017 Compared to Year 
Ended September 30, 2016
Total unallocated costs and other expenses increased $9.6 million to 
$137.3 million in fiscal 2017 compared to $127.7 million in fiscal 
2016. Compensation and benefits increased $2.6 million, or 4% to 
$74.5 million in fiscal 2017 compared to $71.9 million in fiscal 2016.
During fiscal 2017, the increase in fixed compensation and benefits 
is primarily related to the incremental unallocated costs from the 
acquisition of the Sterne Agee correspondent clearing and independent 
wealth management businesses and increases in several administrative 
departments, most notably our information technology department. 
The decrease in variable compensation and benefits is primarily related 
to lower performance in fiscal 2017, primarily due to the bad debt on 
physical coal, and its impact on executive incentive compensation.

ITEM 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

We seek to make our non-interest expenses variable to the greatest 
extent possible, and to keep our fixed costs as low as possible. The 
table above shows an analysis of our variable expenses and non-variable 
expenses as a percentage of total non-interest expenses for the years 
ended September 30, 2018, 2017, and 2016.
Our variable expenses consist of variable compensation paid to traders 
and risk management consultants, bonuses paid to operational, 
administrative and executive employees, transaction-based clearing 

expenses and introducing broker commissions. As a percentage of 
total non-interest expenses, variable expenses were 61% in fiscal 2018, 
53% in fiscal 2017 and 58% in fiscal 2016.
The decline in the percentage of variable expenses in fiscal 2017 was 
primarily due to the Bad Debt on Physical Coal - see the discussion in 
the Executive Summary previously discussed for additional information.

We report our operating segments based on services provided to clients. 
Net contribution is one of the key measures used by management to 
assess the performance of each segment and for decisions regarding the 
allocation of our resources. Net contribution is calculated as revenues 
less direct cost of sales, transaction-based clearing expenses, introducing 
broker commissions, interest expense and variable compensation. Variable 
compensation paid to risk management consultants and traders generally 
represents a fixed percentage of an amount equal to revenues generated, 

and in some cases, revenues generated less transaction-based clearing 
expense and related charges, base salaries and an overhead allocation.
Segment income is calculated as net contribution less non-variable 
direct expenses of the segment. These non-variable direct expenses 
include trader base compensation and benefits, operational charges, 
communication and data services, business development, professional 
fees, bad debt expense, trade errors and direct marketing expenses.

Commercial Hedging
We serve our commercial clients through our team of risk management 
consultants, providing a high-value-added service that we believe 
differentiates us from our competitors and maximizes the opportunity 
to retain our clients. Our risk management consulting services are 

designed to quantify and monitor commercial entities’ exposure 
to commodity and financial risk. Upon assessing this exposure, 
we develop a plan to control and hedge these risks with post-trade 
reporting against specific client objectives. Our clients are assisted 
in the execution of their hedging strategies through a wide range of 
products from listed exchange-traded futures and options, to basic 
OTC instruments that offer greater flexibility and structured OTC 
products designed for customized solutions.
Our services span virtually all traded commodity markets, with 
the largest concentrations in agricultural and energy commodities 
(consisting primarily of grains, energy and renewable fuels, coffee, 
sugar, cotton, and food service) and base metals products listed on 
the LME. Our base metals business includes a position as a Category 
One ring dealing member of the LME, providing execution, clearing 
and advisory services in exchange-traded futures and OTC products. 
We also provide execution of foreign currency forwards and options 
and interest rate swaps as well as a wide range of structured product 
solutions to our commercial clients who are seeking cost-effective 
hedging strategies. Generally, our clients direct their own trading 
activity, and our risk management consultants do not have discretionary 
authority to transact trades on behalf of our clients.

ITEM 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Year Ended September 30, 2018 Compared to Year 
Ended September 30, 2017
Operating revenues increased 17% to $286.7 million in fiscal 2018 
compared to $244.6 million in fiscal 2017. Exchange-traded revenues 
increased 11% to $150.3 million in fiscal 2018, driven by increased 
activity from clients in the domestic grain and energy and renewable 
fuels markets as well as an increase in exchange-traded revenues 
from omnibus relationships introduced by our commercial hedging 
employees, which are reflected in the ‘Other’ category above. Those 
increases were partially offset by a modest decline in LME metals. 
Overall exchange-traded contract volume increased 16%, while the 
average rate per contract declined to $5.36.
OTC revenues increased 22%, to $98.3 million in fiscal 2018 driven 
by both a 12% increase in OTC volumes and a 10% increase in the 
average rate per contract compared to the prior year. OTC volumes 
grew to 1.58 million contracts in fiscal 2018 compared to 1.41 million 
in fiscal 2017, driven by growth in agricultural commodity markets, 
primarily with Brazilian grain clients as well as increased activity in food 
service and dairy markets and soft commodities. These increases were 
offset by lower interest rate swap, energy and renewable fuels revenues.
Consulting, management and account fees increased 5% to 
$15.4 million in fiscal 2018 compared to $14.7 million in fiscal 
2017 while interest income increased 71%, to $22.8 million, in 
fiscal 2018 compared to $13.3 million in fiscal 2017. The increase 
in interest income was driven by an increase in short term interest 
rates, as average client equity was relatively flat with the prior fiscal 
year at $938.0 million.
Segment income increased 32% to $96.4 million in fiscal 2018 
compared to $72.8 million in fiscal 2017, driven by the growth 
in operating revenues and a $1.0 million reduction in bad debt 
expense. This growth was partially offset by a $1.3 million increase 
in interest expense. Variable expenses, excluding interest, expressed 
as a percentage of operating revenues were unchanged at 42% in 
fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017.

Year Ended September 30, 2017 Compared to Year 
Ended September 30, 2016
Operating revenues increased 4% to $244.6 million in fiscal 2017 
compared to $236.1 million in fiscal 2016. Exchange-traded revenues 
increased 3% to $135.9 million in fiscal 2017, resulting primarily from 
higher agricultural and energy and renewable fuels revenues. Those 
increases were partially offset by a modest decline in LME metals. 
Overall exchange-traded contract volume increased 4%, while the 
average rate per contract declined to $5.61.
OTC revenues decreased marginally to $80.7 million in fiscal 2017 
while OTC volumes increased 2% to 1.41 million contracts in 
fiscal 2017 compared to 1.38 million in fiscal 2016. OTC revenues 
were relatively flat with the prior year, as modest OTC volume growth 

was offset by lower spreads across virtually all commodity sectors 
leading to a 5% decline in the average rate per contract.
Consulting, management and account fees increased 6% to 
$14.6 million in fiscal 2017 compared to $13.8 million in fiscal 
2016 while interest income, increased 56%, to $13.3 million in 
fiscal 2017 compared to $8.5 million in fiscal 2016. The increase in 
interest income is driven by an increase in short term interest rates 
as well as a 2% increase in average client equity.
Segment income increased 6% to $72.8 million in fiscal 2017 compared 
to $68.7 million in fiscal 2016, driven by the growth in operating 
revenues, partially offset by a $3.3 million increase in non-variable 
direct expenses. The increase in non-variable direct expenses was 
primarily related to an increase in operations charges and non-variable 
clearing expenses. Variable expenses, excluding interest, expressed as 
a percentage of operating revenues decreased to 42% in fiscal 2017 
compared to 43% in fiscal 2016.

Global Payments
We provide global payment solutions to banks and commercial 
businesses as well as charities and non-governmental and government 
organizations. We offer payments services in more than 170 countries 
and 140 currencies, which we believe is more than any other payments 
solution provider, and provide transparent pricing.
Our proprietary FXecute global payments platform is integrated with 
a financial information exchange (“FIX”) protocol. This FIX protocol 
is an electronic communication method for the real-time exchange of 
information, and we believe it represents one of the first FIX offerings 
for cross-border payments in exotic currencies. FIX functionality 
allows clients to view real time market rates for various currencies, 
execute and manage orders in real-time, and view the status of their 
payments through the easy-to-use portal.
Additionally, as a member of the Society for Worldwide Interbank 
Financial Telecommunication (“SWIFT”), we are able to offer 
our services to large money center and global banks seeking more 
competitive international payments services.
Through this single comprehensive platform and our commitment 
to client service, we believe we are able to provide simple and fast 
execution, ensuring delivery of funds in any of these countries quickly 
through our global network of approximately 300 correspondent 
banks. In this business, we primarily act as a principal in buying and 
selling foreign currencies on a spot basis. We derive revenue from the 
difference between the purchase and sale prices.
We believe our clients value our ability to provide exchange rates 
that are significantly more competitive than those offered by large 
international banks, a competitive advantage that stems from our years 
of foreign exchange expertise focused on smaller, less liquid currencies.

Year Ended September 30, 2018 Compared to Year 
Ended September 30, 2017
Operating revenues increased 11% to $99.2 million in fiscal 2018 
compared to $89.2 million in fiscal 2017. The volume of payments 
made declined 1%, versus the prior year period while the average revenue 
per trade increased by 13%. The volume of payments has declined 
while the average revenue per trade has increased compared to fiscal 
2017, as certain commercial clients who had previously transacted 
their individual high-volume but low-value payments through our 
platform, opened their own bank accounts in certain countries to 
which we had made payments into on their behalf. Although this 
process change may lower our number of payments, we still provide 
the foreign currency funding payments into these clients’ accounts 
on an aggregated basis in these countries, which reduces our overall 
variable expenses due to the lower number of payments made. Overall, 
operating revenues increased in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 
as a result of an increase in both the number of active clients and the 
dollar value of the payments made versus the prior year.
Segment income increased 18% to $59.8 million in fiscal 2018 
compared to $50.6 million in fiscal 2017. This increase primarily 
resulted from the increase in operating revenues and a decline in variable 
introducing broker commissions, partially offset by a $1.4 million 
increase in non-variable direct expenses versus the prior year period, 
driven in large part by higher non-variable compensation and trade 
system costs. Variable expenses, excluding interest, expressed as a 
percentage of operating revenues was 24% in fiscal 2018 compared 
to 28% in fiscal 2017.

Year Ended September 30, 2017 Compared to Year 
Ended September 30, 2016
Operating revenues increased 22% to $89.2 million in fiscal 2017 
compared to $73.2 million in fiscal 2016. The volume of payments 
made increased by 46%, as we continue to benefit from an increase 
in financial institutions and other clients utilizing our electronic 
transaction order system, however this was partially offset by a 16% 
decrease in the average revenue per trade.
Segment income decreased 27% to $50.6 million in fiscal 2017 
compared to $39.8 million in fiscal 2016. The increase primarily 
resulted from the increase in operating revenues, partially offset by an 
increase in non-variable direct expenses, primarily in compensation 
and benefits, trade system costs, and operations charges. Variable 
expenses, excluding interest, expressed as a percentage of operating 
revenues was 28% in fiscal 2017 compared to 29% in fiscal 2016.

Securities
We provide value-added solutions that facilitate cross-border trading 
and believe our clients value our ability to manage complex transactions, 
including foreign exchange, utilizing our local understanding of 
market convention, liquidity and settlement protocols around the 
world. Our clients include U.S.-based regional and national broker-
dealers and institutions investing or executing client transactions in 
international markets and foreign institutions seeking access to the 
U.S. securities markets. We are one of the leading market makers 
in foreign securities, including unlisted ADRs, GDRs and foreign 
ordinary shares. We make markets in over 5,000 ADRs, GDRs and

foreign ordinary shares, of which over 3,600 trade in the OTC market. 
In addition, we will, on request, make prices in more than 10,000 
unlisted foreign securities. We are also a broker-dealer in Argentina

U.S. Treasury, U.S. government agency, agency mortgage-backed 
and asset-backed securities to a client base including asset managers, 
commercial bank trust and investment departments, broker-dealers 
and insurance companies.

We originate, structure and place debt instruments in the international 
and domestic capital markets. These instruments include complex 
asset-backed securities (primarily in Argentina) and domestic municipal 
securities. On occasion, we may invest our own capital in debt 
instruments before selling them. We also actively trade in a variety of 
international debt instruments as well as operate an asset management 
business in which we earn fees, commissions and other revenues for 
management of third party assets and investment gains or losses on 
our investments in funds and proprietary accounts managed either 
by our investment managers or by independent investment managers.

PART II 
Item 7 management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Year ended September 30, 2018 Compared to Year 
ended September 30, 2017
Operating revenues increased 29% to $196.2 million in fiscal 2018 
compared to $151.7 million in fiscal 2017.
Operating revenues in Equity Capital Markets, which we formerly 
referred to as Equity Market-Making, increased 64%, to $93.2 million 
in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017, as a result of a 34% increase in 
the gross dollar volume traded as well as a 3% increase in the average 
revenue per $1,000 traded. An increase in market volatility led to 
increases in both the gross dollar volume traded as well as the average 
revenue per $1,000 traded, while gross dollar volume also benefited 
from the on-boarding of new clients and an increase in market share. 
Equity Capital Markets operating revenues include the trading profits 
we earn before the related expense deduction for ADR conversion fees. 
These ADR fees are included in the consolidated income statements 
as ‘transaction-based clearing expenses’.
Operating revenues in Debt Capital Markets, which now includes both 
our Debt Trading and Investment Banking businesses discussed in 
prior filings, increased 15% to $95.3 million in fiscal 2018 compared 
to fiscal 2017, primarily as a result of an increase in interest income in 
our domestic institutional fixed income business as well as increased 
activity in our municipal securities businesses. Operating revenues 
in the prior year period included a $2.1 million gain on the sale of 
exchange shares held in Argentina. Asset Management operating 
revenues in fiscal 2018 decreased 35% to $7.7 million in fiscal 2018 
versus $11.9 million in fiscal 2017 as a result of difficult market 
conditions in Argentina. Average assets under management in Argentina 
were $424.9 million in fiscal 2018 compared to $564.9 million in 
fiscal 2017.
Segment income decreased 12% to $40.8 million in fiscal 2018 
compared to $46.6 million in fiscal 2017, as strong performance 
in Equity Capital Markets was more than offset by declines in our 
domestic institutional fixed income business as a result of an increase 
in interest expense, as well as weaker performance in our Argentine 
operations in both Debt Capital Markets and Asset Management. 
Variable expenses, excluding interest, expressed as a percentage of 
operating revenues increased to 36% in fiscal 2018 compared to 34% 
in fiscal 2017, primarily as a result of an increase in transaction-based 
clearing expenses.

Year ended September 30, 2017 Compared to Year 
ended September 30, 2016
Operating revenues decreased 13% to $151.7 million in fiscal 2017 
compared to $175.2 million in fiscal 2016.
Operating revenues in Equity Capital Markets decreased 9%, to 
$56.7 million in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016, as a result of 
a 7% decline in the average revenue per $1,000 traded as a result 
of lower market volatility as well as a 1% decline in the gross dollar 
volume traded. Equity Capital Markets operating revenues include 

the trading profits we earn before the related expense deduction for 
ADR conversion fees. These ADR fees are included in the consolidated 
income statements as ‘transaction-based clearing expenses’.
Operating revenues in Debt Capital Markets decreased 12% to 
$80.4 million in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016, primarily as a 
result of a decline in operating revenue in our Argentina operations 
compared to the prior year. Our Argentine operations had a strong 
performance in the prior year as a result of the effect of the devaluation 
of the Argentine Peso. These declines in Argentina were partially 
offset by operating revenue growth in our domestic institutional fixed 
income business. Investment Banking operating revenues declined 
27% in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016, resulting primarily as 
a result of management’s decision to exit our domestic investment 
banking business. Asset Management operating revenues in fiscal 2017 
decreased 35% to $11.9 million in fiscal 2017 versus $18.2 million 
in fiscal 2016. Similar to Debt Capital Markets, Asset Management 
operating revenues had a strong performance in the prior year as 
a result of the devaluation of the Argentine Peso. Average assets 
under management were $564.9 million in fiscal 2017 compared to 
$562.4 million in fiscal 2016.
Segment income decreased 33% to $46.6 million in fiscal 2017 
compared to $69.4 million in fiscal 2016 primarily as a result of the 
decrease in operating revenues as well as a $7.9 million increase in 
interest expense in our domestic institutional fixed income business. 
Variable expenses, excluding interest, expressed as a percentage of 
operating revenues decreased to 34% in fiscal 2017 compared to 
36% in fiscal 2016.

Physical Commodities
This segment consists of our physical Precious Metals trading and 
Physical Ag & Energy commodity businesses. In Precious Metals, we 
provide a full range of trading and hedging capabilities, including 
OTC products, to select producers, consumers, and investors. In our 
trading activities, we act as a principal, committing our own capital 
to buy and sell precious metals on a spot and forward basis.
In our Physical Ag & Energy commodity business, we act as a principal 
to facilitate financing, structured pricing and logistics services to 
clients across the commodity complex, including energy commodities, 
grains, oil seeds, cotton, coffee, cocoa, edible oils and feed products. 
We provide financing to commercial commodity-related companies 
against physical inventories. We use sale and repurchase agreements 
to purchase commodities evidenced by warehouse receipts, subject 
to a simultaneous agreement to sell such commodities back to the 
original seller at a later date.
We generally mitigate the price risk associated with commodities 
held in inventory through the use of derivatives. We do not elect 
hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP in accounting for this price 
risk mitigation. Management continues to evaluate performance and 
allocate resources on an operating revenue basis.

Year ended September 30, 2018 Compared to Year 
ended September 30, 2017
Operating revenues increased 27% to $56.9 million in fiscal 2018 
compared to $44.8 million in fiscal 2017.
Precious metals operating revenues increased 15% to $29.9 million 
in fiscal 2018 compared to $26.1 million in fiscal 2017. Operating 
revenues increased as a result of an 83% increase in the number of 
ounces traded, which was partially offset by a 37% decline in the 
average revenue per ounce traded.

Operating revenues in Physical Ag & Energy increased 44% to 
$27.0 million in fiscal 2018 compared to $18.7 million in fiscal 2017. 
The increase in operating revenues is primarily due to continued 
growth in our U.S. subsidiary FCStone Merchant Services, LLC, 
resulting in increased transactions in edible oils, industrial feedstock 
for biodiesel facilities, energy products, cotton and cocoa along with 
an increase in its commodity financing programs with clients from 
both existing and new client relationships.
Segment income was $16.6 million in fiscal 2018 compared to a 
segment loss of $(31.4) million in fiscal 2017. Segment income in

fiscal 2018 includes a $1.0 million charge to earnings for an allowance 
for doubtful accounts recorded in the first quarter of 2018, for bad 
debt incurred in our physical coal business. The segment loss in fiscal 
2017 included a $47.0 million charge to earnings for an allowance 
for doubtful accounts recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017, for a 
bad debt incurred in our physical coal business. We have exited the 
physical coal business, which was conducted solely in our Singapore 
subsidiary, INTL Asia Pte. Ltd. See Executive Summary for additional 
information related to the Bad Debt on Physical Coal. Variable expenses, 
excluding interest expense, expressed as a percentage of operating 
revenues remained unchanged at 25% in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017.

Year ended September 30, 2017 Compared to Year 
ended September 30, 2016
Operating revenues increased 22% to $44.8 million in fiscal 2017 
compared to $36.6 million in fiscal 2016.
Precious metals operating revenues increased 9% to $26.1 million 
in fiscal 2017 compared to $23.9 million in fiscal 2016. Operating 
revenues increased as a result of a 49% increase in the number of 
ounces traded, while the average revenue per ounce traded decreased 
27% as market volatility decreased, resulting in a narrowing of spreads.
Operating revenues in Physical Ag & Energy increased 47% to 
$18.7 million in fiscal 2017 compared to $12.7 million in fiscal 
2016. The increase in operating revenues is primarily due to business 
expansion in our U.S. subsidiary, FCStone Merchant Services, LLC, 
which had an increase in operating revenues of $6.5 million, or 57%, 
following an internal restructuring of the business, resulting in increased 
operating revenues from both existing and new client relationships.
Segment loss was $31.4 million in fiscal 2017 compared to segment 
income of $13.3 million in fiscal 2016, resulting in a decrease of 
336%. The segment loss was primarily due to a charge to earnings 
of $47.0 million to record an allowance for doubtful accounts for a 
bad debt incurred in our physical coal business, which was conducted 
solely in our Singapore subsidiary, INTL Asia Pte. Ltd.
Partially offsetting the segment loss within Physical Ag & Energy, 
segment income generated by FCStone Merchant Services, LLC 
increased $2.3 million, or 153%, over the prior year due to increased 
operating revenues reduced by higher interest expense and non-
variable direct expenses. Precious metals segment income increased 
$0.6 million over the prior year. Variable expenses, excluding interest 
expense, expressed as a percentage of operating revenues remained 
unchanged at 25% in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016.

Clearing and execution Services
We provide competitive and efficient clearing and execution in all 
major futures and securities exchanges globally as well as prime 
brokerage in major foreign currency pairs and swap transactions. 
Through our platform, client orders are accepted and directed to the 
appropriate exchange for execution. We then facilitate the clearing 
of client transactions. Clearing involves the matching of client trades 
with the exchange, the collection and management of client margin 
deposits to support the transactions, and the accounting and reporting 
of the transactions to clients.
As of September 30, 2018, we held $2.6 billion in required client 
segregated assets, which we believe makes us the third largest non-bank 
futures commission merchant (“FCM”) in the U.S., as measured by 
required client segregated assets. We seek to leverage our capabilities 
and capacity by offering facilities management or outsourcing solutions 
to other FCM’s.
We are an independent full-service provider to introducing broker-
dealers (“IBD’s”) of clearing, custody, research, syndicated and 
security-based lending products and services, including a proprietary 
technology platform which offers seamless connectivity to ensure 
a positive client experience through the clearing and settlement 
process. Our independent wealth management business, which 
offers a comprehensive product suite to retail clients nationwide, 
clears through this platform. We believe we are one of the leading 
mid-market clearer’s in the securities industry, with approximately 
60 correspondent clearing relationships with over $15 billion in assets 
under management or administration as of September 30, 2018.
Within this segment, we also maintain what we believe is one of 
the largest non-bank prime brokers and swap dealers in the world. 
Through this offering, we provide prime brokerage foreign exchange 
(“FX”) services to financial institutions and professional traders. We 
provide our clients with the full range of OTC products, including 
24-hour a day execution of spot, forwards and options as well as 
non-deliverable forwards in both liquid and exotic currencies. We 
also operate a proprietary foreign exchange desk that arbitrages the 
exchange-traded foreign exchange markets with the cash markets.
Through our London-based Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) 
oil voice brokerage business, we employ over 30 employees providing 
brokerage services across the fuel, crude and middle distillates markets 
with over 200 well known commercial and institutional clients 
throughout Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

Operating revenues in our FX Prime Brokerage declined 3% to 
$18.2 million in fiscal 2018 compared to $18.7 million in fiscal 2017 
as a result of a 35% decline in foreign exchange volumes compared 
to fiscal 2017.
Correspondent Clearing operating revenues increased 8%, to 
$29.3 million in fiscal 2018 compared to the prior year, primarily 
driven by a $3.1 million increase in interest income. Operating 
revenues in Independent Wealth Management increased 1%, to 
$73.3 million in fiscal 2018 compared to the prior year. Operating 
revenues in Derivative Voice Brokerage increased 6% versus the prior 
year to $28.2 million in fiscal 2018.
Segment income increased 59% to $48.3 million in fiscal 2018 
compared to $30.4 million in fiscal 2017, primarily as a result of 
the increase in operating revenues as well as a $4.1 million decline

in non-variable direct expenses compared to the prior year period. 
This decline in non-variable direct expenses, was primarily a result of 
cost savings initiatives in the FX Prime Brokerage and Correspondent 
Clearing businesses. Segment income in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 
includes a $3.6 million charge to compensation and benefits per the 
terms of the acquisition of the oil voice brokerage business. Per the 
terms of the acquisition, this charge terminates at the end of fiscal 
2018. Variable expenses, excluding interest, as a percentage of operating 
revenues were 70% in fiscal 2018 compared to 69% in fiscal 2017.

Year ended September 30, 2017 Compared to Year 
ended September 30, 2016
Operating revenues increased 72% to $259.8 million in fiscal 2017 
compared to $151.1 million in fiscal 2016.
Operating revenues in our Exchange-Traded Futures and Options 
business increased 8% to $114.9 million in fiscal 2017 compared 
to $106.1 million in fiscal 2016, despite a 2% decline in exchange-
traded volumes as the average rate per contract increased 8%. Interest 
income in the Exchange-Traded Futures & Options business increased 
$3.3 million to $8.4 million in fiscal 2017 primarily as a result of 
an increase in short-term rates and a 13% increase in average client 
equity to $1,077.8 million in fiscal 2017 compared to $955.1 million 
in fiscal 2016.
Operating revenues in our FX Prime Brokerage declined 11% to 
$18.7 million in fiscal 2017 compared to $20.9 million in fiscal 2016, 
despite a 7% increase in foreign exchange volumes resulting from a 
narrowing of margins compared to fiscal 2016.
During the fourth fiscal quarter of 2016, we acquired the correspondent 
clearing and independent wealth management businesses of Sterne 
Agee. During fiscal 2017, the Correspondent Clearing and Independent 

Wealth Management businesses generated operating revenues of 
$27.2 million and $72.3 million, respectively. Included within these 
operating revenues, Correspondent Clearing and Independent Wealth 
Management businesses had interest income of $4.9 million and 
$0.5 million, respectively.
On October 1, 2016, we acquired ICAP plc’s London-based EMEA 
oil voice brokerage business. During fiscal 2017, the Derivative Voice 
Brokerage business contributed $26.7 million in operating revenues.
Segment income increased 105% to $30.4 million in fiscal 2017 
compared to $14.8 million in fiscal 2016, primarily as a result of 
the acquisition of the Correspondent Clearing, Independent Wealth 
Management and Derivative Voice Brokerage businesses and growth in 
our Exchange-traded Futures & Options business, which were partially 
offset by a decline in segment income in our FX Prime Brokerage 
business. Segment income in fiscal 2017 includes a $0.9 million 
quarterly charge to compensation and benefits per the terms of the 
acquisition of the oil voice brokerage business that aggregated to 
$3.6 million in fiscal 2017. The quarterly charge will continue to be 
expensed through the end of fiscal 2018 based upon the employees 
continued employment. Variable expenses, excluding interest, as a 
percentage of operating revenues were 69% in fiscal 2017 compared to 
73% in fiscal 2016. The increase in introducing broker commissions 
expense was primarily driven by the activity of the Sterne Agee 
independent wealth management business, acquired during the fourth 
quarter of fiscal 2016 and thus only three months of expenses were 
included in fiscal 2016, resulting in higher expense of $42.1 million, 
as well as a $5.0 million increase in introducing broker commissions 
expense in the Exchange-traded Futures & Options business. Non-
variable direct expenses increased $22.9 million versus the prior year 
as the result of the acquisitions discussed above, which collectively 
added $21.8 million in non-variable expenses in fiscal 2017.

Liquidity, Financial Condition and Capital Resources

Overview
Liquidity is defined as our ability to generate sufficient amounts of 
cash to meet all of our cash needs. Liquidity is of critical importance 
to us and imperative to maintaining our operations on a daily basis. 
Our senior management establishes liquidity and capital policies, 
and monitors liquidity on a daily basis. Senior management reviews 
business performance relative to these policies and monitors the 
availability of our internal and external sources of financing. Liquidity 
and capital matters are reported regularly to our board of directors.
INTL FCStone Financial is registered as a broker-dealer with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and is a member of 
the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) and the 
Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (“MSRB”). In addition, INTL 
FCStone Financial is registered as a futures commission merchant 
with the CFTC and NFA, and a member of various commodities and 
futures exchanges in the U.S. and abroad. INTL FCStone Financial 
has a responsibility to meet margin calls at all exchanges on a daily 
basis and intra-day basis, if necessary. We require our clients to make 
any required margin deposits the next business day, and we require 
our largest clients to make intra-day margin payments during periods 
of significant price movement. Margin required to be posted to the 

exchanges is a function of the net open positions of our clients and 
the required margin per contract. INTL FCStone Financial is subject 
to minimum capital requirements under Section 4(f)(b) of the 
Commodity Exchange Act, Part 1.17 of the rules and regulations of 
the CFTC and the SEC Uniform Net Capital Rule 15c3-1 under the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These rules specify the minimum 
amount of capital that must be available to support our clients’ open 
trading positions, including the amount of assets that INTL FCStone 
Financial must maintain in relatively liquid form, and are designed 
to measure general financial integrity and liquidity. INTL FCStone 
Financial is also subject to the Rule 15c3-3 of the Securities Exchange 
Act of 1934, as amended (“Customer Protection Rule”).
INTL FCStone Ltd, our U.K. regulated subsidiary, is required to be 
compliant with the U.K.’s Individual Liquidity Adequacy Standards 
(“ILAS”). To comply with these standards, we have implemented 
daily liquidity procedures, conduct periodic reviews of liquidity by 
stressed scenarios, and have created liquidity buffers.
Our wholly owned subsidiary, SA Stone Wealth Management Inc. 
(formerly Sterne Agee Financial Services, Inc.) is subject to the SEC 
Uniform Net Capital Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities Exchange 
Act of 1934.

Item 7 management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

In addition, in our physical commodities trading, commercial hedging 
OTC, securities and foreign exchange trading activities, we may be 
called upon to meet margin calls with our various trading counterparties 
based upon the underlying open transactions we have in place with 
those counterparties.
We continuously review our overall credit and capital needs to ensure 
that our capital base, both stockholders’ equity and debt, as well as 
available credit facilities can appropriately support the anticipated 
financing needs of our operating subsidiaries.
As of September 30, 2018, we had total equity capital of $505.3 million 
and outstanding bank loans of $355.2 million.
A substantial portion of our assets are liquid. As of September 30, 
2018, approximately 95% of our assets consisted of cash; securities 
purchased under agreements to resell; securities borrowed; deposits with 
and receivables from exchange-clearing organizations, broker-dealers, 
clearing organizations and counterparties; client receivables, marketable 
financial instruments and investments, and physical commodities 
inventory. All assets that are not client and counterparty deposits are 
financed by our equity capital, bank loans, short-term borrowings from 
financial instruments sold, not yet purchased and under repurchase 
agreements, securities loaned and other payables.
As of September 30, 2018, we had deferred tax assets totaling 
$19.8 million. We are required to assess our deferred tax assets 
and the need for a valuation allowance at each reporting period. In 
assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether 
it is more likely than not that we will not realize some or all of the 
deferred tax assets. We are required to record a valuation allowance 
against deferred tax assets when it is considered more likely than not 
that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. The 
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2018 
and September 30, 2017 was $3.5 and $4.0 million, respectively. The 
valuation allowances as of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 
2017 were primarily related to U.S. state and local and foreign net 
operating loss carryforwards that, in the judgment of management, 
are not more likely than not to be realized.
We incurred U.S. federal, state, and local taxable losses for the 
years ended September 30, 2018 (excluding the mandatory deemed 
repatriation dividend of foreign subsidiaries accumulated and current 
earnings and profits), 2017, and 2016 of $(3.7) million, $(20.5) million, 
and $(9.7) million, respectively. The differences between actual levels 
of past taxable losses and pre-tax book income (losses) are primarily 
attributable to temporary differences in these jurisdictions. When 
evaluating if U.S. federal, state, and local deferred taxes are realizable, 
we considered deferred tax liabilities of $5.0 million that are scheduled 
to reverse from 2019 to 2021 and $2.5 million of deferred tax liabilities 
associated with unrealized gains in securities which we could sell, if 
necessary. Furthermore, we considered our ability to implement business 
and tax planning strategies that would allow the remaining U.S. federal, 
state, and local deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, to be 
realized in less than 5 years. Based on the tax planning strategies that 
are prudent and feasible, management believes that it is more likely 
than not that we will realize the tax benefit of the deferred tax assets, 
net of the existing valuation allowance, in the future. However, the 
realization of deferred income taxes is dependent on future events, 
and changes in estimate in future periods could result in adjustments 
to the valuation allowance.

Client and Counterparty Credit and 
Liquidity Risk
Our operations expose us to credit risk of default of our clients and 
counterparties. The risk includes liquidity risk to the extent our clients 
or counterparties are unable to make timely payment of margin or 
other credit support. These risks expose us indirectly to the financing 
and liquidity risks of our clients and counterparties, including the 
risks that our clients and counterparties may not be able to finance 
their operations.
As a clearing broker, we act on behalf of our clients for all trades 
consummated on exchanges. We must pay initial and variation 
margin to the exchanges, on a net basis, before we receive the required 
payments from our clients. Accordingly, we are responsible for our 
clients’ obligations with respect to these transactions, which exposes 
us to significant credit risk. Our clients are required to make any 
required margin deposits the next business day, and we require our 
largest clients to make intra-day margin payments during periods of 
significant price movement. Our clients are required to maintain initial 
margin requirements at the level set by the respective exchanges, but 
we have the ability to increase the margin requirements for clients 
based on their open positions, trading activity, or market conditions.
With OTC derivative transactions, we act as a principal, which 
exposes us to the credit risk of both our clients and the counterparties 
with which we offset our client positions. As with exchange-traded 
transactions, our OTC transactions require that we meet initial and 
variation margin payments on behalf of our clients before we receive 
the required payment from our clients. OTC clients are required to 
post sufficient collateral to meet margin requirements based on value-
at-risk models as well as variation margin requirement based on the 
price movement of the commodity or security in which they transact. 
Our clients are required to make any required margin deposits the next 
business day, and we may require our largest clients to make intra-day 
margin payments during periods of significant price movement. We 
have the ability to increase the margin requirements for clients based 
on their open positions, trading activity, or market conditions. On 
a limited basis, we provide credit thresholds to certain clients, based 
on internal evaluations and monitoring of client creditworthiness.
In addition, with OTC transactions, we are at risk that a counterparty 
will fail to meet its obligations when due. We would then be exposed 
to the risk that the settlement of a transaction which is due a client 
will not be collected from the respective counterparty with which the 
transaction was offset. We continuously monitor the credit quality of 
our respective counterparties and mark our positions held with each 
counterparty to market on a daily basis.
We enter into securities purchased under agreements to resell, 
securities sold under agreements to repurchase, securities borrowed 
and securities loaned transactions to, among other things, finance 
financial instruments, acquire securities to cover short positions, 
acquire securities for settlement, and to accommodate counterparties’ 
needs. In connection with these agreements and transactions, it is our 
policy to receive or pledge cash or securities to adequately collateralize 
such agreements and transactions in accordance with general industry 
guidelines and practices. The value of the collateral is valued daily 
and we may require counterparties to deposit additional collateral or 
return collateral pledged, when appropriate.

Excluding the bad debt on physical coal discussed below, during 
the fiscal years ended September 30, 2018, 2017, and 2016, we 
recorded bad debts, net of recoveries of $3.1 million, $4.3 million, 
and $4.4 million, respectively. During the year ended September 30, 
2018, our bad debts primarily related to $2.8 million of agricultural 
OTC client account deficits in the Commercial Hedging segment 
and $0.4 million of exchange-traded client account deficits in the 
Clearing & Execution Services segment, partially offset by a provision 
decrease in the Physical Commodities segment. During the year ended 
September 30, 2017, our bad debts included $3.8 million of client 
deficits in the Commercial Hedging segment, primarily related to 
account deficits from South Korean and Dubai commercial LME 
clients, $0.2 million of uncollectible client receivables in our Physical 
Commodities segment, and $0.3 million of uncollectible client 
receivables in the CES segment, primarily related to our derivative 
voice brokerage business. During the year ended September 30, 
2016, our bad debts included $3.6 million of client deficits in the 
Commercial Hedging segment, $0.4 million of uncollectible client 
receivables in the Physical Commodities segment and $0.4 million 
of uncollectible service fees and notes in the Securities segment. 
Additional information related to bad debts, net of recoveries, for the 
fiscal years ended September 30, 2018, 2017, and 2016 is set forth 
in Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Bad Debt on Physical Coal
During the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, 
we recorded charges to earnings of $1.0 million and $47.0 million, 
respectively, to record an allowance for doubtful accounts related to 
a bad debt incurred in our physical coal business, conducted solely in 
our Singapore subsidiary, INTL Asia Pte. Ltd., with a coal supplier. 
Components of the bad debt on physical coal include allowances on 
amounts due to us from our supplier related to: coal paid for but 
not delivered to clients; reimbursement of demurrage claims, dead 
freight and other charges paid by INTL Asia Pte. Ltd. to its clients; 
reimbursement due for deficiencies in the quality of coal delivered to 
clients; and losses incurred related to the cancellation of open sales 
contracts. We have completed our exit of the physical coal business. 
INTL Asia Pte. Ltd. was recapitalized following the bad debt in order 
for its other businesses to operate in normal course. See Executive 
Summary for additional information related to the Bad Debt on 
Physical Coal.

Primary Sources and Uses of Cash
Our assets and liabilities may vary significantly from period to period 
due to changing client requirements, economic and market conditions 
and our growth. Our total assets as of September 30, 2018 and 
September 30, 2017, were $7.8 billion and $6.2 billion, respectively. 
Our operating activities generate or utilize cash as a result of net income 
or loss earned or incurred during each period and fluctuations in our 
assets and liabilities. The most significant fluctuations arise from changes 
in the level of client activity, commodities prices and changes in the 
balances of financial instruments and commodities inventory. INTL 
FCStone Financial and INTL FCStone Ltd occasionally utilize their 
margin line credit facilities, on a short-term basis, to meet intraday 
settlements with the commodity exchanges prior to collecting margin 
funds from their clients.

The majority of the assets of INTL FCStone Financial and INTL 
FCStone IFL are restricted from being transferred to its parent or 
other affiliates due to specific regulatory requirements. This restriction 
has no impact on our ability to meet our cash obligations, and no 
impact is expected in the future.
We have liquidity and funding policies and processes in place that are 
intended to maintain significant flexibility to address both company-
specific and industry liquidity needs. The majority of our excess 
funds are held with high-quality institutions, under U.S. government 
obligations, interest earning cash deposits, AA-rated money market 
investments and highly liquid reverse repurchase agreements.
As of September 30, 2018, we had $354.7 million in undistributed 
foreign earnings. The Company recognized the one-time U.S. 
repatriation tax due under Tax Reform and, as a result, repatriation 
of these amounts would not be subject to additional U.S. federal 
income tax but would be subject to applicable withholding taxes in 
the relevant jurisdictions. Our intent is to permanently reinvest these 
funds outside of the United States, with the exception of $13.0 million 
that will be distributed in fiscal year 2019. Foreign withholding tax 
is not applicable to this distribution.
As of September 30, 2018, we had four committed bank credit facilities, 
totaling $594.5 million, of which $336.2 million was outstanding. 
The credit facilities include:
•• A three-year syndicated loan facility, committed until March 18, 
2019, under which we are entitled to borrow up to $262.0 million, 
subject to certain terms and conditions of the credit agreement. The 
loan proceeds are used to finance working capital needs of us and 
certain subsidiaries. The agreement contains financial covenants 
related to consolidated tangible net worth, consolidated funded 
debt to net worth ratio, consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and 
consolidated net unencumbered liquid assets, as defined.
•• An unsecured syndicated loan facility, committed until April 4, 2019, 
under which our subsidiary, INTL FCStone Financial is entitled to 
borrow up to $75.0 million, subject to certain terms and conditions 
of the credit agreement. This facility is intended to provide short-term 
funding of margin to commodity exchanges as necessary.
•• A syndicated borrowing facility, committed until November 1, 
2019, under which our subsidiary, FCStone Merchant Services, 
LLC is entitled to borrow up to $232.5 million, subject to certain 
terms and conditions of the credit agreement. The loan proceeds 
are used to finance traditional commodity financing arrangements 
and commodity repurchase agreements.
•• An unsecured syndicated loan facility, committed until January 31, 
2019, under which our subsidiary, INTL FCStone Ltd is entitled to 
borrow up to $25.0 million, subject to certain terms and conditions 
of the credit agreement. This facility is intended to provide short-term 
funding of margin to commodity exchanges as necessary.
Additional information regarding the committed bank credit facilities 
can be found in Note 10 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. As 
reflected above, $362.0 million of our committed credit facilities are 
scheduled to expire during the 12-month period beginning with the 
filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We intend to renew 
or replace these facilities as they expire, and based on our liquidity 
position and capital structure, we believe we will be able to do so.

As of September 30, 2018, we had six uncommitted bank credit 
facilities with an outstanding balance of $17.8 million. The credit 
facilities include:
•• A secured uncommitted loan facility under which INTL FCStone 
Financial may borrow up to $75.0 million, collateralized by 
commodity warehouse receipts, to facilitate U.S. commodity exchange 
deliveries of its clients, subject to certain terms and conditions of 
the credit agreement. 
•• A secured uncommitted loan facility under which INTL FCStone 
Financial may borrow up to $100.0 million for short term funding 
of firm and client margin requirements, subject to certain terms and 
conditions of the agreement. The borrowings are secured by first 
liens on firm owned marketable securities or client owned securities 
which have been pledged to us under a clearing arrangement. 
•• A secured uncommitted loan facility under which INTL FCStone 
Financial may borrow up to $50.0 million for short term funding 
of firm and client margin requirements, subject to certain terms and 
conditions of the agreement. The borrowings are secured by first 
liens on firm owned marketable securities or client owned securities 
which have been pledged to us under a clearing arrangement. 
•• A secured uncommitted loan facility under which INTL FCStone 
Financial may borrow requested amounts for short term funding of 
firm and client margin requirements. The uncommitted maximum 
amount available to be borrowed is not specified, and all requests 
for borrowing are subject to the sole discretion of the lender. The 
borrowing are secured by first liens on firm owned marketable 
securities or client owned securities which have been pledged to us 
under a clearing arrangement. 
•• A secured uncommitted loan facility under which INTL FCStone 
Ltd may borrow up to £20.0 million, collateralized by commodity 
warehouse receipts, to facilitate financing of commodities under 
repurchase agreement services to its clients, subject to certain terms 
and conditions of the credit agreement.
•• A secured uncommitted loan facility under which FCStone Merchant 
Services, LLC may borrow up to $15.0 million, collateralized by a 
first priority security interest in the goods and inventory of FCStone 
Merchant Services, LLC that is either located outside of the U.S. and 
Canada or in transit to a destination outside the U.S. or Canada, 
to facilitate the financing of inventory of commodities and other 
products or goods approved by the lender in its sole discretion, subject 
to certain terms and conditions of the loan facility agreement. In 
December 2018, the Company executed an amendment to increase 
the availability under this uncommitted loan facility to $20.0 million. 
Our facility agreements contain certain financial covenants relating 
to financial measures on a consolidated basis, as well as on a certain 
stand-alone subsidiary basis, including minimum tangible net worth, 
minimum regulatory capital, minimum net unencumbered liquid 
assets, maximum net loss, minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and 
maximum funded debt to net worth ratio. Failure to comply with any 
such covenants could result in the debt becoming payable on demand. 
As of September 30, 2018, we and our subsidiaries are in compliance 
with all of our financial covenants under the outstanding facilities.

Cash Flows
Our cash and cash equivalents increased from $314.9 million as of 
September 30, 2017 to $342.3 million as of September 30, 2018, 

a net increase of $27.4 million. Net cash of $74.0 million was used 
in operating activities, $15.4 million was used in investing activities 
and net cash of $120.9 million was provided by financing activities, 
of which $125.8 million was drawn on lines of credit, net, and 
increased the amounts payable to lenders under loans. Fluctuations 
in exchange rates caused a reduction of $4.1 million to our cash and 
cash equivalents.
In the commodities industry, companies report trading activities 
in the operating section of the statement of cash flows. Due to the 
daily price volatility in the commodities market, as well as changes 
in margin requirements, fluctuations in the balances of deposits held 
at various exchanges, marketable securities and client commodity 
accounts may occur from day-to-day. A use of cash, as calculated on 
the consolidated statement of cash flows, includes unrestricted cash 
transferred and pledged to the exchanges or guarantee funds. These 
funds are held in interest-bearing deposit accounts at the exchanges, 
and based on daily exchange requirements, may be withdrawn and 
returned to unrestricted cash. Additionally, within our unregulated 
OTC and foreign exchange operations, cash deposits received from 
clients are reflected as cash provided from operations. Subsequent 
transfer of these cash deposits to counterparties or exchanges to 
margin their open positions will be reflected as an operating use of 
cash to the extent the transfer occurs in a different period than the 
cash deposit was received.
Capital expenditures included in investing activities for property, plant 
and equipment totaled $12.5 million in fiscal 2018, $16.1 million 
in fiscal 2017 and $15.4 million in fiscal 2016. Capital expenditures 
over the past three years has included core information technology 
hardware acquisitions and leasehold improvements on office space. 
Additionally, over the past three years, we have been undergoing a 
trade system conversion intended to replace an internally developed 
system as well as a current third-party provided system. We have 
capitalized $17.0 million of direct costs of materials and third-party 
services related to obtaining and developing the trade system over 
this three year period. On August 1, 2017, we implemented the first 
phase of the trade system related to our OTC commodities business 
in our Commercial Hedging segment, and the next phase of the 
system related to our FX Prime Brokerage activities, in our Clearing 
and Execution Services segment, is in the application development 
stage, and is expected to be placed into service during fiscal 2019. 
We estimate the useful lives for the trade systems to be ten years.
During fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, we had no repurchases of our 
outstanding common stock. During fiscal 2016, we repurchased 
750,204 shares of our outstanding common stock in open market 
transactions, for an aggregate purchase price of $19.5 million.
On September 30, 2018, the previously authorized repurchase of up 
to 1.0 million shares of our outstanding common stock from time to 
time in open market purchases and private transactions expired. As 
of the date of this filing, no additional authorization by our Board 
of Directors has occurred. Previously approved plans were subject 
to the discretion of the senior management team to implement 
our stock repurchase plan, and subject to market conditions and as 
permitted by securities laws and other legal, regulatory and contractual 
requirements and covenants.
Apart from what has been disclosed above, there are no known trends, 
events or uncertainties that have had or are likely to have a material 
impact on our liquidity, financial condition and capital resources.

Other Capital Considerations
Our activities are subject to various significant governmental regulations 
and capital adequacy requirements, both in the U.S. and in the 
international jurisdictions in which we operate. Certain other of our 
non-U.S. subsidiaries are also subject to capital adequacy requirements 
promulgated by authorities of the countries in which they operate.
Our subsidiaries are in compliance with all of their capital regulatory 
requirements as of September 30, 2018. Additional information on 
these net capital and minimum net capital requirements can be found 
in Note 12 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Dodd-Frank Act created a comprehensive new regulatory regime 
governing the OTC and listed derivatives markets and their participants 
by requiring, among other things: centralized clearing of standardized 
derivatives (with certain stated exceptions); the trading of clearable 
derivatives on swap execution facilities or exchanges; and registration 
and comprehensive regulation of new categories of market participants 
as “swap dealers” and swap “introducing brokers.” Our subsidiary, 
INTL FCStone Markets, LLC, is a provisionally registered swap 
dealer. We will continue to monitor all applicable developments in 
the ongoing implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act.

Total contractual obligations exclude defined benefit pension obligations. 
We comply with the minimum funding requirements, and accordingly 
contributed $1.0 million to our defined benefit pension plans during 
the year ended September 30, 2018. In fiscal 2019, we anticipate 
making contributions of $0.1 million to the defined benefit plans. 
Additional information on the funded status of these plans can be 
found in Note 15 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Based upon our current operations, we believe that cash flow from 
operations, available cash and available borrowings under our credit 
facilities will be adequate to meet our future liquidity needs.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
We are party to certain financial instruments with off-balance sheet 
risk in the normal course of business as a registered securities broker-
dealer, futures commission merchant, U.K. based financial services 
firm, provisionally registered swap dealer and from our market-making 
and proprietary trading in the foreign exchange and commodities 
trading activities. These financial instruments include futures, forward 
and foreign exchange contracts, exchange-traded and OTC options, 
mortgage-backed To Be Announced (TBA) securities and interest 
rate swaps. Derivative financial instruments involve varying degrees 
of off-balance sheet market risk whereby changes in the fair values of 
underlying financial instruments may result in changes in the fair value 
of the financial instruments in excess of the amounts reflected in the 
balance sheet. Exposure to market risk is influenced by a number of 
factors, including the relationships between the financial instruments 
and our positions, as well as the volatility and liquidity in the markets 
in which the financial instruments are traded. The principal risk 
components of financial instruments include, among other things, 
interest rate volatility, the duration of the underlying instruments and 
changes in commodity pricing and foreign exchange rates. We attempt 
to manage our exposure to market risk through various techniques. 

Aggregate market limits have been established and market risk measures 
are routinely monitored against these limits. Derivative contracts are 
traded along with cash transactions because of the integrated nature 
of the markets for such products. We manage the risks associated with 
derivatives on an aggregate basis along with the risks associated with our 
proprietary trading and market-making activities in cash instruments 
as part of our firm-wide risk management policies.
A significant portion of these instruments are primarily the execution 
of orders for commodity futures and options on futures contracts on 
behalf of our clients, substantially all of which are transacted on a 
margin basis. Such transactions may expose us to significant credit 
risk in the event margin requirements are not sufficient to fully cover 
losses which clients may incur. We control the risks associated with 
these transactions by requiring clients to maintain margin deposits 
in compliance with individual exchange regulations and internal 
guidelines. We monitor required margin levels daily and, therefore, 
may require clients to deposit additional collateral or reduce positions 
when necessary. We also establish contract limits for clients, which 
are monitored daily. We evaluate each client’s creditworthiness on a 
case-by-case basis. Clearing, financing, and settlement activities may 
require us to maintain funds with or pledge securities as collateral with 
other financial institutions. Generally, these exposures to exchanges are 
subject to netting of open positions and collateral, while exposures to 
clients are subject to netting, per the terms of the client agreements, 
which reduce the exposure to us by permitting receivables and payables 
with such clients to be offset in the event of a client default. Management 
believes that the margin deposits held as of September 30, 2018 are 
adequate to minimize the risk of material loss that could be created 
by positions held at that time. Additionally, we monitor collateral fair 
value on a daily basis and adjust collateral levels in the event of excess 
market exposure. Generally, these exposures to both counterparties 
and clients are subject to master netting agreements and the terms of 
the client agreements, which reduce our exposure.

Item 7 management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

As a broker-dealer in U.S. Treasury obligations, U.S. government agency 
obligations, agency mortgage-backed obligations, and asset-backed 
obligations, we are engaged in various securities trading, borrowing 
and lending activities servicing solely institutional counterparties. 
Our exposure to credit risk associated with the nonperformance of 
counterparties in fulfilling their contractual obligations pursuant to 
these securities transactions and market risk associated with the sale 
of securities not yet purchased can be directly impacted by volatile 
trading markets which may impair their ability to satisfy outstanding 
obligations to us. In the event of non-performance and unfavorable 
market price movements, we may be required to purchase or sell 
financial instruments, which may result in a loss to us.
We transact OTC and foreign exchange contracts with our clients, and 
our OTC and foreign exchange trade desks will generally offset the 
client’s transaction simultaneously with one of our trading counterparties 
or will offset that transaction with a similar, but not identical, position 
on the exchange. These unmatched transactions are intended to be 
short-term in nature and are conducted to facilitate the most effective 
transaction for our client.
Additionally, we hold options and futures on options contracts 
resulting from market-making and proprietary trading activities in 
these product lines. We assist clients in our commodities trading 
business to protect the value of their future production (precious or base 
metals) by selling them put options on an OTC basis. We also provide 
our physical commodities trading business clients with sophisticated 
option products, including combinations of buying and selling puts 
and calls. We mitigate our risk by effecting offsetting options with 
market counterparties or through the purchase or sale of exchange-
traded commodities futures. The risk mitigation of offsetting options 
is not within the documented hedging designation requirements of 
the Derivatives and Hedging Topic of the ASC.
As part of the activities discussed above, we carry short positions. We 
sell financial instruments that we do not own, borrow the financial 
instruments to make good delivery, and therefore are obliged to purchase 
such financial instruments at a future date in order to return the borrowed 
financial instruments. We record these obligations in the consolidated 
financial statements as of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, 
at fair value of the related financial instruments, totaling $866.5 million 
and $717.6 million, respectively. These positions are held to offset the 
risks related to financial assets owned, and reported in our consolidated 
balance sheets in ‘financial instruments owned, at fair value’, and 
‘physical commodities inventory, net’. We will incur losses if the fair 
value of the financial instruments sold, not yet purchased, increases 

Critical Accounting Policies

subsequent to September 30, 2018, which might be partially or wholly 
offset by gains in the value of assets held as of September 30, 2018. The 
totals of $866.5 million and $717.6 million include a net liability of 
$193.4 million and $317.0 million for derivatives, based on their fair 
value as of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, respectively.
We do not anticipate non-performance by counterparties in the 
above situations. We have a policy of reviewing the credit standing of 
each counterparty with which we conduct business. We have credit 
guidelines that limit our current and potential credit exposure to any 
one counterparty. We administer limits, monitor credit exposure, 
and periodically review the financial soundness of counterparties. 
We manage the credit exposure relating to our trading activities in 
various ways, including entering into collateral arrangements and 
limiting the duration of exposure. Risk is mitigated in certain cases by 
closing out transactions and entering into risk reducing transactions.
We are a member of various exchanges that trade and clear futures and 
option contracts. We are also a member of and provide guarantees to 
securities clearinghouses and exchanges in connection with client trading 
activities. Associated with our memberships, we may be required to pay 
a proportionate share of the financial obligations of another member 
who may default on its obligations to the exchanges. While the rules 
governing different exchange memberships vary, in general our guarantee 
obligations would arise only if the exchange had previously exhausted 
its resources. In addition, any such guarantee obligation would be 
apportioned among the other non-defaulting members of the exchange. 
Our liability under these arrangements is not quantifiable and could 
exceed the cash and securities we have posted as collateral at the exchanges. 
However, management believes that the potential for us to be required 
to make payments under these arrangements is remote. Accordingly, 
no contingent liability for these arrangements has been recorded in 
the consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2018 and 2017.

effects of Inflation
Because our assets are, to a large extent, liquid in nature, they are 
not significantly affected by inflation. Increases in our expenses, such 
as compensation and benefits, transaction-based clearing expenses, 
occupancy and equipment rental, due to inflation, may not be readily 
recoverable from increasing the prices of our services. While rising 
interest rates are generally favorable for us, to the extent that inflation 
has other adverse effects on the financial markets and on the value of 
the financial instruments held in inventory, it may adversely affect 
our financial position and results of operations.

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with 
U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of 
contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the 
reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period. 
The accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section 
are those that we consider the most critical to the financial statements. 
We believe these estimates and assumptions can involve a high degree 
of judgment and complexity. Due to their nature, estimates involve 
judgment based upon available information. Actual results or amounts 
could differ from estimates and the difference could have a material 

impact on the financial statements. Therefore, understanding these 
policies is important in understanding our reported and potential 
future results of operations and financial position.
Valuation of Financial Instruments and Foreign Currencies. 
Substantially all financial instruments are reflected in the consolidated 
financial statements at fair value, or amounts that approximate fair 
value due to their short-term nature or level of collateralization. 
These financial instruments include: cash and cash equivalents; 
cash, securities and other assets segregated under federal and other 
regulations; securities purchased under agreements to resell; securities 

52

                                 - Form 10-KPART II 
Item 7 management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

borrowed; deposits with and receivables from broker-dealers, clearing 
organizations, and counterparties; financial instruments owned; 
securities sold under agreements to repurchase; securities loaned; 
and financial instruments sold, but not yet purchased. Unrealized 
gains and losses related to these financial instruments, which are not 
client owned positions, are reflected in earnings. Where available, 
we use prices from independent sources such as listed market prices, 
third-party pricing services, or broker or dealer price quotations. 
Fair values for certain derivative contracts are derived from pricing 
models that consider current market and contractual prices for the 
underlying financial instruments or commodities, as well as time 
value and yield curve or volatility factors underlying the positions. 
In some cases, even though the value of a security is derived from 
an independent market price, or broker or dealer quote, certain 
assumptions may be required to determine the fair value. However, 
these assumptions may be incorrect and the actual value realized 
upon disposition could be different from the current carrying value. 
The value of foreign currencies, including foreign currencies sold, not 
yet purchased, are converted into their U.S. dollar equivalents at the 
foreign exchange rates in effect at the close of business at the end of 
the accounting period. For foreign currency transactions completed 
during each reporting period, the foreign exchange rate in effect at 
the time of the transaction is used.
The application of the valuation process for financial instruments 
and foreign currencies is critical because these items represent a 
significant portion of our total assets and total liabilities. Valuations 
for substantially all of the financial instruments held are available 
from independent publishers of market information. The valuation 
process may involve estimates and judgments in the case of certain 
financial instruments with limited liquidity and OTC derivatives. 
Given the wide availability of pricing information, the high degree of 
liquidity of the majority of our assets, and the relatively short periods 
for which they are typically held in inventory, there is insignificant 
sensitivity to changes in estimates and insignificant risk of changes 
in estimates having a material effect on our consolidated financial 
statements. The basis for estimating the valuation of any financial 
instruments has not undergone any change.
Revenue Recognition. A significant portion of our revenues are 
derived principally from realized and unrealized trading income in 
securities, derivative instruments, commodities and foreign currencies 
purchased or sold for our account. We record realized and unrealized 
trading income on a trade date basis. We state financial instruments 
owned and financial instruments sold, not yet purchased and foreign 
currencies sold, not yet purchased, at fair value with related changes 
in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflected in ‘trading gains, 
net’ in the consolidated income statements. We record fee and interest 
income on the accrual basis and dividend income is recognized on 
the ex-dividend date.
Revenue on commodities that are purchased for physical delivery to 
clients and that are not readily convertible into cash is recognized 
at the point in time when the commodity has been shipped, title 
and risk of loss has been transferred to the client, and the following 
conditions have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement 
exists, the price is fixed and determinable, and collectability of the 
resulting receivable is reasonably assured.
The critical aspect of revenue recognition is recording all known 
transactions as of the trade date of each transaction for the financial 
period. We have developed systems for each of our businesses to capture 

all known transactions. Recording all known transactions involves 
reviewing trades that occur after the financial period that relate to 
the financial period. The accuracy of capturing this information is 
dependent upon the completeness and accuracy of data capture of 
the operations systems and our clearing firms.
Income Taxes. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and 
numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required 
in determining the consolidated income taxes and in evaluating 
tax positions, including evaluating income tax uncertainties. As a 
result, the company recognizes tax liabilities based on estimates of 
whether additional taxes and interest will be due. These tax liabilities 
are recognized when despite our belief that our tax return positions 
are supportable, we believe that certain positions may not be fully 
sustained upon review by the relevant tax authorities.
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated 
future tax consequences attributable to differences between the 
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities 
and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those 
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The 
effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is 
recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. 
Significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation 
allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for 
a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, management considers all 
available evidence for each jurisdiction including past operating results, 
estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of ongoing tax 
planning strategies. In the event that we change our determination as 
to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust 
our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to income tax 
expense in the period in which such determination is made.
We believe that our accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all 
open audit years based on our assessment of many factors including 
past experience and interpretations of tax law. This assessment relies 
on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex 
judgments about future events. To the extent that new information 
becomes available which causes us to change our judgment regarding 
the adequacy of existing tax liabilities, such changes to tax liabilities will 
impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination 
is made. The consolidated income taxes will change period to period 
based on non-recurring events, such as the settlement of income tax 
audits and changes in tax law, as well as recurring factors including 
the geographic mix of income before taxes, state and local taxes, and 
the effects of various global income tax strategies.

Accounting Standards Update
In August 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) 
issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2018-15, “Intangibles - 
Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): 
Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud 
Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract”, which clarifies 
that implementation costs incurred by customers in cloud computing 
arrangements are deferred if they would be capitalized by customers 
in software licensing arrangements under the internal-use software 
guidance. This ASU is effective for public business entities for annual 
and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019.

Early adoption is permitted. We expect to adopt this guidance in the 
first quarter of fiscal year 2021. We are continuing to evaluate the 
impact that the adoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated 
financial statements.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-14, “Compensation - 
Retirement Benefits - Defined Benefit Plans - General (Subtopic 715-20): 
Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for 
Defined Benefit Plans”, which aims to improve the overall usefulness of 
disclosures to financial statement users and reduce unnecessary costs 
to companies when preparing defined benefit plan disclosures. This 
ASU is effective for public business entities for financial statements 
issued for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2020. Retrospective 
adoption is required and early adoption is permitted. We expect to 
adopt this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. We do 
not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact 
on our consolidated financial statements.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, “Fair Value 
Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the 
Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement”, which aims to 
improve the overall usefulness of disclosures to financial statement users 
and reduce unnecessary costs to companies when preparing fair value 
measurement disclosures. The ASU adds certain additional fair value 
measurement disclosures as well as eliminating or modifying certain 
existing fair value measurement disclosures. This ASU is effective for 
all entities for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after 
December 15, 2019. Retrospective adoption is required except for 
changes in disclosures related to changes in unrealized gains and losses 
included in other comprehensive income for Level 3 instruments, the 
range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to 
develop Level 3 fair value measurements, and the narrative description 
of measurement uncertainty. Early adoption is permitted. An entity 
may early adopt eliminated or modified disclosure requirements 
and delay adoption of the additional disclosure requirements until 
their effective date. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, we 
early adopted the eliminated disclosure requirements related to the 
amount of and reasons for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 
of the fair value hierarchy, the timing of transfers between levels of 
the fair value hierarchy, and the valuation processes for Level 3 fair 
value measurements. We expect to adopt the additional and modified 
disclosure requirements in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. We 
do not expect the modified or additional disclosure requirements to 
have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or 
related disclosures.
In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02, “Income 
Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): 
Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other 
Comprehensive Income”. The ASU provides that the stranded tax 
effects from the Tax Reform on the balance of other comprehensive 
income may be reclassified to retained earnings. The ASU is effective 
for periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with an election to 
adopt early. We expect to adopt this guidance starting with the first 
quarter of fiscal year 2020. We do not expect the adoption of this ASU 
to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts 
with Customers (Topic 606)”. ASU 2014-09 completes the joint effort 
by the FASB and International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) 
to improve financial reporting by creating common revenue recognition 
guidance for GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards 

54

(IFRS). ASU 2014-09 supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition 
guidance under U.S. GAAP. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 
2015-14, “Revenues from Contracts with Customers: Deferral of the 
Effective Date”, which deferred the effective date for implementation 
of ASU 2014-09 by one year. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 
2016-08, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): 
Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross 
versus Net)”. ASU 2016-08 clarifies the implementation guidance 
on principal versus agent considerations. In April 2016, the FASB 
issued ASU 2016-10, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
(Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing”. 
ASU 2016-10 clarifies the implementation guidance on identifying 
performance obligations. These ASUs apply to all companies that 
enter into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services. 
These ASUs are effective for public entities for interim and annual 
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. We adopted 
the provisions of this guidance on October 1, 2018. Entities have the 
choice to apply these ASUs either retrospectively to each reporting 
period presented or by recognizing the cumulative effect of applying 
these standards at the date of initial application and not adjusting 
comparative information. We will adopt the new standard using the 
modified retrospective method. However, as we have not identified 
any material revenues from contracts with customers that result in a 
change in the timing of revenue recognition under ASU 2014-09, there 
will be no cumulative effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. 
We have performed an assessment of our revenue contracts as well 
as worked with industry participants and reviewed industry specific 
guidance on matters of interpretation and application and have not 
identified any material changes to the timing or amount of our revenue 
recognition under ASU 2014-09. Our accounting policies did not 
change materially as a result of applying the principles of revenue 
recognition from ASU 2014-09 and are largely consistent with existing 
guidance and current practices applied. We will provide additional 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures, including a disaggregation 
of revenue, a description of performance obligations, and other 
disclosures in accordance with ASU 2014-09.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases 
(Topic 842)”, which supersedes ASC 840, Leases. We will adopt this 
guidance starting with the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 using a 
modified retrospective transition approach. This accounting update 
will require the Company as a lessee to recognize on the consolidated 
balance sheet all leases with terms exceeding one year, which results in 
the recognition of a right of use asset and corresponding lease liability, 
including for those leases that we currently classify as operating leases. 
The right of use asset and lease liability will initially be measured 
using the present value of the remaining rental payments. In July 2018, 
the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-10, “Codification Improvements 
to Topic 842, Leases” and ASU No. 2018-11, “Leases (Topic 842) 
Targeted Improvements”. ASU 2018-10 provides certain amendments 
that affect narrow aspects of the guidance issued in ASU 2016-02. 
ASU 2018-11 allows all entities adopting ASU 2016-02 to choose an 
additional (and optional) transition method of adoption, under which 
an entity initially applies the new leases standard at the adoption date 
and recognizes a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance 
of retained earnings in the period of adoption. ASU 2018-11 also 
allows lessors to not separate non-lease components from the associated 
lease component if certain conditions are met. We are in the process 
of identifying the population of leases affected by the guidance and 
evaluating the impact ASU 2016-02 will have on our consolidated 
financial statements and related disclosures.

market Risk

We conduct our market-making and trading activities predominantly 
as a principal, which subjects our capital to significant risks. These risks 
include, but are not limited to, absolute and relative price movements, 
price volatility and changes in liquidity, over which we have virtually 
no control. Our exposure to market risk varies in accordance with the 
volume of client-driven market-making transactions, the size of the 
proprietary positions and the volatility of the financial instruments 
traded.
We seek to mitigate exposure to market risk by utilizing a variety of 
qualitative and quantitative techniques:
•• Diversification of business activities and instruments;
•• Limitations on positions;

•• Allocation of capital and limits based on estimated weighted risks; and
•• Daily monitoring of positions and mark-to-market profitability.
We utilize derivative products in a trading capacity as a dealer to 
satisfy client needs and mitigate risk. We manage risks from both 
derivatives and non-derivative cash instruments on a consolidated 
basis. The risks of derivatives should not be viewed in isolation, but 
in aggregate with our other trading activities.
Management believes that the volatility of revenues is a key indicator 
of the effectiveness of its risk management techniques.

The graph below summarizes volatility of our daily revenue, determined on a marked-to-market basis, during the year ended September 30, 2018.

In our Securities market-making and trading activities, we maintain inventories of equity and debt securities. In our Physical Commodities 
segment, our positions include physical inventories, forwards, futures and options on futures, and OTC derivatives. Our commodity trading 
activities are managed as one consolidated book for each commodity encompassing both cash positions and derivative instruments. We monitor 
the aggregate position for each commodity in equivalent physical ounces, metric tons, or other relevant unit.

Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about market Risk

Interest Rate Risk

In the ordinary course of our operations, we have interest rate risk 
from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect the values 
of financial instruments and impact interest income earned. Within 
our domestic institutional fixed income business, we maintain a 
significant amount of trading assets and liabilities which are sensitive 
to changes in interest rates. These trading activities consist primarily of 
securities trading in connection with U.S. Treasury, U.S. government 
agency, agency mortgage-backed and agency asset-backed obligations. 
Derivative instruments, which consist of futures, mortgage-backed 
TBA securities and forward settling transactions, are used to manage 
risk exposures in the trading inventory. We enter into TBA securities 
transactions for the sole purpose of managing risk associated with the 
purchase of mortgage pass-through securities.
In addition, we generate interest income from the positive spread 
earned on client deposits. We typically invest in U.S. Treasury bills, 
notes, and obligations issued by government sponsored entities, 
reverse repurchase agreements involving U.S. Treasury bills and 
government obligations or AA-rated money market funds. In some 
instances, we maintain interest earning cash deposits with banks, 
clearing organizations and counterparties. We have an investment 
policy which establishes acceptable standards of credit quality and 
limits the amount of funds that can be invested within a particular 
fund and institution.
We employ an interest rate management strategy, where we use 
derivative financial instruments in the form of interest rate swaps 
and/or outright purchases of medium-term U.S. Treasury notes 
to manage a portion of our aggregate interest rate position. On a 
quarterly basis, we evaluate our overall level of short-term investable 
balances, net of our of variable rate debt, and either invest a portion 
of these investable balances in medium-term U.S. Treasury notes or 
enter into interest rate swaps, when a sufficient interest rate spread 
between short-term and medium-term rates exists. Under this strategy, 
we do not actively trade in such instruments and generally intend 

to hold these investment to their maturity date. Under this strategy, 
excluding cash deposits and our investments in AA-rated money 
market funds, the weighted average time to maturity of our portfolio 
is not to exceed 24 months in duration.
Currently we hold no U.S. Treasury notes or interest rate swap 
derivative contracts as part of this strategy. During fiscal 2018, 
operating revenues include no unrealized gains or losses on the fair 
value of U.S. Treasury notes and interest rate swaps, while fiscal 
2017 and 2016 operating revenues included unrealized losses of 
$5.8 million and $0.7 million, respectively, related to the change in 
fair value of these U.S. Treasury notes and interest rate swaps. The 
U.S. Treasury notes and interest rate swaps were not designated for 
hedge accounting treatment, and changes in their fair values, which 
are volatile and can fluctuate from period to period, were included 
in operating revenues in the current periods.
Currently our short term investment balances are held in short term 
U.S. Treasury bills, interest earning cash deposits and AA-rated money 
market fund investments. The weighted-average time to maturity of 
the portfolio, excluding cash deposits and our investments in AA-rated 
money market funds, is less than three months.
We manage interest expense using a combination of variable and fixed 
rate debt as well as including the average outstanding borrowings 
in our calculations of the notional value of interest rate swaps to be 
entered into as part of our interest rate management strategy discussed 
above. The debt instruments are carried at their unpaid principal 
balance which approximates fair value. As of September 30, 2018, 
$354.0 million of our debt was variable-rate debt. We are subject to 
earnings and liquidity risks for changes in the interest rate on this 
debt. As of September 30, 2018, we had $1.2 million outstanding 
in fixed-rate long-term debt. There are no earnings or liquidity risks 
associated with our fixed-rate debt.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors 
INTL FCStone Inc.:

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of INTL 
FCStone Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 30, 2018 
and 2017, the related consolidated income statements, consolidated 
statements of comprehensive income, consolidated statements of cash 
flows, and consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity for each 
of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2018, and 
the related notes and financial statement schedule (collectively, the 
consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated 
financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial 
position of the Company as of September 30, 2018 and 2017, and 
the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years 
in the three-year period ended September 30, 2018, in conformity 
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public 
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 
Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 
30 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated 
Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations 
of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated December 11, 
2018 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the 
Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the 
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion 
on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are 
a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required 
to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with 
the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations 
of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the 
PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the 
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated 
financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due 
to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to 
assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial 
statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures 
that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on 
a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the 
consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating 
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by 
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the 
consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide 
a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors 
INTL FCStone Inc.:

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial 
Reporting
We have audited INTL FCStone Inc.’s and subsidiaries’ (the Company) 
internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2018, 
based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework 
(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the 
Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in 
all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting 
as of September 30, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal 
Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of 
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public 
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 
consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of September 30, 2018 
and 2017, and the related consolidated income statements, consolidated 
statements of comprehensive income, consolidated statements of 
cash flows, and consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity for 
each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2018, 
and related notes and financial statement schedule (collectively, the 
consolidated financial statements), and our report dated December 11, 
2018 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial 
statements.
Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s 
internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2018 
excluded PayCommerce Financial Solutions, LLC, acquired with 
effect from September 5, 2018. Our audit of internal control over 
financial reporting of the Company also excluded an evaluation of the 
internal control over financial reporting of PayCommerce Financial 
Solutions, LLC.

Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective 
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the 
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in 
the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over 
Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on 
the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our 
audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB 
and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in 
accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable 
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission 
and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the 
PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit 
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control 
over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our 
audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining 
an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing 
the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the 
design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the 
assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures 
as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our 
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control 
Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process 
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of 
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for 
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes 
those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance 
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the 
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide 
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to 
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of 
the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of 
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable 
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized 
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could 
have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial 
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections 
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to 
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes 
in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or 
procedures may deteriorate.

20,000 commercial and institutional clients and over 80,000 retail 
clients located in more than 130 countries, including commercial 
entities, asset managers, regional, national and introducing broker-
dealers, insurance companies, brokers, institutional investors and 
professional traders, commercial and investment banks and government 
and non-governmental organizations (“NGOs”).

Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the 
accounts of INTL FCStone Inc. and all other entities in which the 
Company has a controlling financial interest. All material intercompany 
transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
Unless otherwise stated herein, all references to fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017, 
and fiscal 2016 refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended September 30.
In the consolidated income statements, the total revenues reported 
combine gross revenues for the physical commodities business and 
net revenues for all other businesses. The subtotal ‘operating revenues’ 
in the consolidated income statements is calculated by deducting 
physical commodities cost of sales from total revenues. The subtotal 
‘net operating revenues’ in the consolidated income statements is 
calculated as operating revenues less transaction-based clearing expenses, 
introducing broker commissions and interest expense. Transaction-
based clearing expenses represent variable expenses paid to executing 
brokers, exchanges, clearing organizations and banks in relation to 
transactional volumes. Introducing broker commissions include 
commission paid to non-employee third parties that have introduced 
clients to the Company. Net operating revenues represent revenues 
available to pay variable compensation to risk management consultants 
and traders and direct non-variable expenses, as well as variable and 
non-variable expenses of operational and administrative employees.

Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with 
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America 
(“U.S. GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of 
contingent liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the 
reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. 
The most significant of these estimates and assumptions relate to fair 
value measurements for financial instruments, revenue recognition, the 
provision for probable losses from bad debts, valuation of inventories, 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, and incomes taxes and 
contingencies. These estimates are based on management’s best knowledge 
of current events and actions the Company may undertake in the future. 
The Company reviews all significant estimates affecting the financial 
statements on a recurring basis and records the effect of any necessary 
adjustments prior to their issuance. Although these and other estimates 
and assumptions are based on the best available information, actual 
results could be materially different from these estimates.

Internal Subsidiaries Consolidation
Effective July 1, 2017, the Company merged its wholly-owned regulated 
United States (“U.S.”) subsidiary, Sterne Agee & Leach, Inc., into the 
wholly owned regulated U.S. subsidiary, INTL FCStone Financial 
Inc. (“INTL FCStone Financial”). As such, the assets, liabilities and 
equity of Sterne Agee & Leach, Inc. were transferred into INTL 
FCStone Financial.

Reclassifications
During the year ended September 30, 2018, the Company separately 
classified non-trading technology and support costs that were previously 
included within ‘Other’ on the consolidated income statements. 
Additionally, during the year ended September 30, 2018, the Company 
separately classified communications related expenses from trading 
systems and market information related costs. In performing these 
reclassifications, the Company has made immaterial, retrospective 
adjustments to conform to the current period presentation. For the 
years ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, ‘Other’ expenses included 
$11.6 million and $7.1 million, respectively, of expenses that are now 
included within ‘Non-trading technology and support’ on the consolidated 
income statements. For the years ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, 
‘Trading systems and market information’ included $5.0 million and 
$4.7 million, respectively, of expenses that are now included within 
‘Communications’ on the consolidated income statements.

Foreign Currency Translation
The Company’s consolidated financial statements are reported in U.S. 
dollars. The Company’s foreign subsidiaries maintain their records either 
in U.S. dollars or in certain instances the currency of the country in 

65

                                  - Form 10-KPART II 
ITEM 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

which they operate. The method of translating local currency financial 
information into U.S. dollars depends on whether the economy in 
which the foreign subsidiary operates has been designated as highly 
inflationary or not. Economies with a three-year cumulative inflation 
rate of more than 100% are considered highly inflationary.
Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries in non-highly inflationary 
economies are translated into U.S. dollars using rates of exchange at 
the balance sheet date. Translation adjustments are recorded in other 
comprehensive income (loss). Revenues and expense are translated 
at rates of exchange in effect during the year. Transaction gains and 
losses are recorded in earnings.
Foreign subsidiaries that operate in highly inflationary countries use the 
U.S. dollar as their functional currency. Local currency monetary assets 
and liabilities are remeasured into U.S. dollars using rates of exchange 
as of each balance sheet date, with remeasurement adjustments and 
other transaction gains and losses recognized in earnings. Nonmonetary 
assets and liabilities do not fluctuate with changes in the local currency 
exchange rates to the dollar as the translated amounts for nonmonetary 
assets and liabilities at the end of the accounting period in which the 
economy becomes highly inflationary becomes the accounting basis 
for those assets and liabilities in the period of change and subsequent 
periods. Revenues and expenses are translated at rates of exchange in 
effect during the year.
The Company operates asset management and debt trading businesses 
in Argentina through various wholly owned subsidiaries. Operating 
revenues from the Argentinean subsidiaries represented approximately 
3% of the consolidated operating revenues for the year ended 
September 30, 2018. The operating environment in Argentina 
continues to present business challenges, including ongoing devaluation 
of the Argentine peso and significant inflation. For the year ended 
September 30, 2018, the Argentine peso declined approximately 
139% (from 17.3 to 41.3 pesos to the U.S. dollar). Based upon 
inflationary data published by the International Practices Task Force 
of the Center for Audit Quality, the economy of Argentina became 
highly inflationary during the three months ended June 30, 2018.
Beginning July 1, 2018, the Company has designated Argentina’s economy 
as highly inflationary for accounting purposes. As a result, the Company 
has accounted for the Argentinean entities using the U.S. dollar as their 
functional currency beginning in the quarter ending September 30, 
2018. Argentine peso-denominated monetary assets and liabilities are 
remeasured at each balance sheet date to the currency exchange rate 
then in effect, with currency remeasurement gains and loses recognized 
in earnings. The translated balances for nonmonetary assets and liabilities 
as of June 30, 2018, became the accounting basis for those assets in the 
period of change and subsequent periods. As a result of Argentina’s highly 
inflationary status, the Company recorded translation losses through 
earnings of $3.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2018.
At September 30, 2018, the Company had net monetary assets 
denominated in Argentine pesos of $11.6 million, including cash 
and cash equivalents of $1.4 million. At September 30, 2018, the 
Company had net nonmonetary assets denominated in Argentine 
pesos of $1.0 million.

Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers cash held at banks and all highly liquid 
investments not held for trading purposes, with original or acquired 
maturities of 90 days or less, including certificates of deposit, to be 

66

cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash, 
foreign currency, and certificates of deposit not deposited with or 
pledged to exchange-clearing organizations, broker-dealers, clearing 
organizations or counterparties, or segregated under federal or other 
regulations. Certificates of deposit are stated at cost plus accrued 
interest, which approximates fair value, and may be withdrawn at 
any time at the discretion of the Company without penalty.

Cash, Securities and Other Assets Segregated 
under Federal and other Regulations
Pursuant to requirements of the Commodity Exchange Act and 
Commission Regulation 30.7 of the U.S. Commodity Futures 
Trading Commission (“CFTC”) in the U.S. and similarly in the 
United Kingdom (“U.K.”), pursuant to the Markets in Financial 
Instruments Implementing Directive 2006/73/EC underpinning 
the Client Asset (“CASS”) rules in the Financial Services Authority 
(“FSA”) handbook, funds deposited by clients relating to futures 
and options on futures contracts in regulated commodities must 
be carried in separate accounts which are designated as segregated 
client accounts. Additionally, in accordance with Rule 15c3-3 of 
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Rule 15c3-3”), the Company 
maintains separate accounts for the exclusive benefit of securities 
clients and proprietary accounts of broker dealers (“PABs”). Rule 
15c3-3 requires the Company to maintain special reserve bank 
accounts (“SRBAs”) for the exclusive benefit of securities clients 
and PABs. The deposits in segregated client accounts and SRBAs 
are not commingled with the funds of the Company. Under the 
FSA’s rules, certain categories of clients may choose to opt-out of 
segregation. As of September 30, 2018 and 2017, cash, securities, 
and other assets segregated under federal and other regulations 
consisted of cash held at banks of approximately $765.4 million 
and $464.3 million, respectively, U.S. Treasury obligations of 
approximately $600.4 million and $33.5 million, respectively, and 
commodities warehouse receipts of approximately $42.9 million 
and $21.0 million, respectively (see fair value measurements 
discussion in Note 3).

Securities Purchased/Sold Under Agreements to 
Resell/Repurchase
The Company enters into securities purchased under agreements 
to resell (reverse repurchase agreements) and securities sold under 
agreements to repurchase (repurchase agreements) primarily to finance 
financial instruments, acquire securities to cover short positions or 
to acquire securities for settlement.
Reverse repurchase agreements and repurchase agreements are treated as 
collateralized financing transactions and are recorded at their contractual 
amounts plus accrued interest. The related interest is recorded in the 
consolidated income statements as ‘interest income’ or ‘interest expense’, 
as applicable. In connection with these agreements and transactions, it 
is the policy of the Company to receive or pledge cash or securities to 
adequately collateralize such agreements and transactions in accordance 
with general industry guidelines and practices. The value of the collateral 
is valued daily and the Company may require counterparties, or may 
be required by counterparties, to deposit additional collateral or return 
collateral pledged, when appropriate. The carrying amounts of these 
agreements and transactions approximate fair value due to their short-
term nature and the level of collateralization.

                                 - Form 10-KSecurities Borrowed and Loaned
The Company enters into securities borrowed and securities loaned 
transactions primarily to meet counterparties’ needs. Securities 
borrowed and securities loaned are reported as collateralized financings. 
Securities borrowed and securities loaned transactions are recorded 
at the amount of cash collateral advanced or received. The Company 
receives collateral generally in excess of the market value of securities 
loaned. The Company monitors the market value of securities borrowed 
and loaned on a daily basis, with additional collateral obtained or 
refunded as necessary. Securities borrowed and securities loaned are 
reported on a gross basis. Interest income and interest expense are 
recognized over the life of the arrangements.

Deposits with and Receivables from 
Broker-dealers, Clearing Organizations and 
Counterparties, and Payables to Broker-dealers, 
Clearing Organizations and Counterparties
As required by the regulations of the CFTC and the aforementioned 
FSA handbook, client funds received to margin, guarantee, and/or 
secure commodity futures and futures on options transactions are 
segregated and accounted for separately from the general assets of the 
Company. Deposits with broker-dealers, clearing organizations, and 
counterparties pertain primarily to deposits made to satisfy margin 
requirements on client and proprietary open futures and options 
on futures positions and to satisfy the requirements set by clearing 
exchanges for clearing membership. The Company also pledges margin 
deposits with various counterparties for OTC derivative contracts, 
and these deposits are also included in deposits with broker-dealers, 
clearing organizations, and counterparties. The Company also deposits 
cash margin with various securities clearing organizations, and these 
deposits are also included in deposits with broker-dealers, clearing 
organizations, and counterparties. Deposits with and receivables from 
broker-dealers, clearing organizations, and counterparties are reported 
gross, except where a right of offset exists. As of September 30, 2018 
and 2017, the Company had cash and cash equivalents on deposit with 
or pledged to broker-dealers, clearing organizations, and counterparties 
of approximately $1.5 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively.
Deposits with and receivables from broker-dealers, clearing 
organizations, and counterparties also include securities pledged to 
exchange-clearing organizations as collateral in lieu of cash margin 
by the Company on behalf of clients and client-owned securities that 
are pledged directly. It is the Company’s practice to include client-
owned securities on its consolidated balance sheets, as the rights to 
those securities have been transferred to the Company under the 
terms of the futures trading agreements. Securities pledged primarily 
include U.S. Treasury obligations, foreign government obligations, 
and certain exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”). Securities that are not 
client-owned are adjusted to fair value with associated changes in 
unrealized gains or losses recorded through current period earnings. 
For client-owned securities, the change in fair value is offset against 
the payable to clients with no impact recognized in the consolidated 
income statements. The fair value of these securities included within 
deposits with and receivables from broker-dealers, clearing organizations, 
and counterparties was $785.8 million and $251.4 million as of 
September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

PART II 
ITEM 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

Management has considered guidance required by Accounting 
Standards Codification (“ASC”) 860 - Transfers and Servicing as it 
relates to securities pledged by clients to margin their accounts within 
the FCM Division of INTL FCStone Financial. Based on a review of 
the agreements with the client, management believes the transferor 
surrenders control over those assets because: (a) the transferred assets 
have been isolated from the transferor—put presumptively beyond the 
reach of the transferor and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or other 
receivership, (b) each transferee has the right to pledge or exchange 
the assets (or beneficial interests) it received, and no condition both 
constrains the transferee (or holder) from taking advantage of its 
right to pledge or exchange and provides more than a trivial benefit 
to the transferor and (c) the transferor does not maintain effective 
control over the transferred assets through either (1) an agreement 
that both entitles and obligates the transferor to repurchase or redeem 
them before their maturity or (2) the ability to unilaterally cause the 
holder to return specific assets, other than through a cleanup call. 
Under this guidance, the Company reflects the client collateral assets 
and corresponding liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance 
sheets as of September 30, 2018 and 2017.
In addition to cash margin, deposits with and receivables from broker-
dealers, clearing organizations, and counterparties include guaranty 
deposits with exchange-clearing organizations. The guaranty deposits 
are held by the clearing organization for use in potential default 
situations by one or more members of the clearing organization. The 
guaranty deposits may be applied to the Company’s obligations to 
the clearing organization, or to the clearing organization’s obligations 
to other clearing members or third parties.
The Company maintains client omnibus and proprietary accounts 
with other counterparties, and the equity balances in those accounts 
along with any margin cash or securities deposited with the carrying 
broker are included in deposits with and receivables from broker-
dealers, clearing organizations, and counterparties.
Deposits with and receivables from broker-dealers, clearing 
organizations, and counterparties also include amounts due from or 
due to exchange-clearing organizations for daily variation settlements 
on open futures and options on futures positions. The variation 
settlements due from or due to exchange-clearing organizations are 
paid in cash on the following business day and represent the settlement 
of futures positions.
Deposits with and receivables from broker-dealers, clearing organizations 
and counterparties, and payables to broker-dealers, clearing organizations 
and counterparties also include amounts related to the value of clients 
cross-currency payment transactions related to the Global Payments 
segment. These amounts arise due to a clearing period before the 
funds are received and payments are made, which usually is one to 
two business days.
Deposits with and receivables from broker-dealers, clearing 
organizations, and counterparties also includes amounts due from 
exchange-clearing organizations for unrealized gains and losses 
associated with clients’ options on futures contracts. See discussion 
in the Financial Instruments section below for additional information 
on the Company’s accounting policies for derivative contracts. For 
client-owned derivative contracts, the fair value is offset against the 
payable to clients with no impact recognized on the consolidated 
income statements.

ITEM 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

Receivable from and Payable to Clients
Receivable from clients, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts, 
include the total of net deficits in individual exchange-traded futures 
and OTC derivative trading accounts carried by the Company. Client 
deficits arise from realized and unrealized trading losses on client 
futures, options on futures, swaps and forwards and amounts due 
on cash and margin transactions. Client deficit accounts are reported 
gross of client accounts that contain net credit or positive balances, 
except where a right of offset exists. Net deficits in individual futures 
exchange-traded and OTC derivative trading accounts include both 
secured and unsecured deficit balances due from clients as of the 
balance sheet date. Secured deficit amounts are backed by U.S. 
Treasury obligations and commodity warehouse receipts. These U.S 
Treasury obligations and commodity warehouse receipts are not 
netted against the secured deficit amounts, as the conditions for right 
of setoff have not been met.
Receivable from clients, net also includes the net amounts receivable 
from securities clients in connection with the settlement of regular-way 
cash securities, margin loans to clients, and client cash debits. It is 
the Company’s policy to report margin loans and payables that arise 
due to positive cash flows in the same client’s accounts on a net basis 
when the conditions for netting as specified in U.S. GAAP are met. 
Clients’ securities transactions cleared by the Company are recorded on 
a settlement date basis. Securities cleared by the Company and pledged 
to the Company as a condition of the custodial clearing arrangements 
are owned by the clients, including those that collateralize margin or 
other similar transactions, and are not reflected on the consolidated 
balance sheets as the Company does not have title to, or beneficial 
interests, in those assets. In the event of uncompleted transactions 
on settlement date, the Company records corresponding receivables 
and payables, respectively. The carrying value of the receivables and 
payables approximates fair value due to their short-term nature.
Payable to clients represent the total of client accounts with credit or 
positive balances. Client accounts are used primarily in connection 
with commodity, foreign exchange, precious metals, and securities 
transactions and include gains and losses on open trades as well as 
securities and cash margin deposits made as required by the Company, 
the exchange-clearing organizations or other clearing organizations. 
Client accounts with credit or positive balances are reported gross of 
client deficit accounts, except where a right of offset exists.
Receivable from and payables to clients also include amounts related 
to the value of clients cross-currency payment transactions related to 
the Global Payments segment. These amounts arise due to a clearing 
period before the funds are received and payments are made, which 
usually is one to two business days.
The future collectability of receivables from clients can be impacted 
by the Company’s collection efforts, the financial stability of its 
clients, and the general economic climate in which it operates. The 
Company evaluates accounts that it believes may become uncollectible 
on a specific identification basis, through reviewing daily margin 
deficit reports, the historical daily aging of the receivables, and by 
monitoring the financial strength of its clients. The Company may 
unilaterally close client trading positions in certain circumstances. In 
addition, to evaluate client margining and collateral requirements, 
client positions are stress tested regularly and monitored for excessive 
concentration levels relative to the overall market size. Furthermore, 

68

in certain instances, the Company is indemnified, and able to charge 
back, introducing broker-dealers for bad debts incurred by their clients.
The Company generally charges off an outstanding receivable balance 
when all economic means of recovery have been exhausted. That 
determination considers information such as the occurrence of 
significant changes in the client’s financial position such that the 
client can no longer pay the obligation, or that the proceeds from 
collateral will not be sufficient to pay the balance.

Notes Receivable
Accrual of commodity financing income on any note is discontinued 
when, in the opinion of management, there is reasonable doubt as to 
the timely collectability of interest or principal. Nonaccrual notes are 
returned to an accrual status when, in the opinion of management, 
the financial position of the borrower indicates there is no longer any 
reasonable doubt as to the timely payment of principal and interest. 
The Company records a charge against earnings for notes receivable 
losses when management believes that the collection of outstanding 
principal is not probable.

Physical Commodities Inventory
Inventories of certain agricultural commodities are carried at net 
realizable value, which approximates fair value less disposal costs. The 
agricultural commodities inventories have reliable, readily determinable 
and realizable market prices, have relatively predictable and insignificant 
costs of disposal and are available for immediate delivery. Changes 
in the fair values of these agricultural commodities inventories are 
included as a component of ‘cost of physical commodities sold’ in 
the consolidated income statements.
Inventories of energy related products are valued at the lower of 
cost or net realizable value. Inventories of precious metals held by 
subsidiaries that are not broker-dealers are valued at the lower of cost 
or net realizable value, using the weighted-average price and first-in 
first-out costing method.
Precious metals inventory held by INTL FCStone Ltd, a U.K. based 
broker-dealer subsidiary, is measured at fair value, with changes in 
fair value included as a component of ‘trading gains, net’ in the 
consolidated income statements.

Property and Equipment
Property and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated 
depreciation and amortization and depreciated using the straight-
line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold 
improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated 
useful life of the improvement or the term of the lease, whichever is 
shorter. Certain costs of software developed or obtained for internal 
use are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the 
software. Expenditures for maintenance, repairs, and minor replacements 
are charged against earnings, as incurred. Expenditures that increase the 
value or productive capacity of assets are capitalized. When property 
and equipment are retired, sold, or otherwise disposed of, the asset’s 
carrying amount and related accumulated depreciation are removed 
from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in earnings.

                                 - Form 10-KGoodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets
Goodwill is the cost of acquired companies in excess of the fair value of 
identifiable net assets at the acquisition date. Goodwill is not subject to 
amortization, but rather is evaluated for impairment at least annually.
The Company evaluates its goodwill for impairment at the fiscal year 
end (or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist) in 
accordance with ASC 350 - Intangibles - Goodwill and Other. Goodwill 
impairment is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of a 
reporting unit with its respective carrying value. If the estimated fair 
value exceeds the carrying value, goodwill at the reporting unit level 
is not deemed to be impaired. However, if the estimated fair value 
is below carrying value, further analysis is required to determine the 
amount of the impairment. This further analysis involves assigning 
tangible assets and liabilities, identified intangible assets and goodwill 
to reporting units and comparing the fair value of each reporting unit 
to its carrying amount.
In the course of the evaluation of the potential impairment of goodwill, 
the Company may perform either a qualitative or a quantitative 
assessment. The Company’s qualitative assessment of potential 
impairment may result in the determination that a quantitative 
impairment analysis is not necessary. Under this elective process, 
the Company assesses qualitative factors to determine whether the 
existence of events or circumstances leads the Company to determine 
that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is 
less than its carrying amount. If after assessing the totality of events or 
circumstances, the Company determines it is more likely than not that 
the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, 
then performing a quantitative analysis is not required. However, if 
the Company concludes otherwise, then the Company performs a 
quantitative impairment analysis.
If the Company either chooses not to perform a qualitative assessment, 
or the Company chooses to perform a qualitative assessment but is 
unable to qualitatively conclude that no impairment has occurred, 
then the Company performs a quantitative evaluation. In the case of 
a quantitative assessment, the Company estimates the fair value of the 
reporting unit which the goodwill that is subject to the quantitative 
analysis is associated (generally defined as the businesses for which 
financial information is available and reviewed regularly by management) 
and compares it to the carrying value. If the estimated fair value of a 
reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the Company estimates 
the fair value of all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including 
goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is greater 
than the estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recognized for 
the excess. The fair value of the Company’s reporting units exceeded 
their respective carrying values under the first step of the quantitative 
assessment and no impairment charges were recorded for any of the 
periods presented.
Identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization are amortized 
using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit, 
ranging from two to twenty years. Identifiable intangible assets are 
tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances 
suggest that an asset’s or asset group’s carrying value may not be fully 
recoverable. Residual value is presumed to be zero for all identifiable 
intangible assets.

PART II 
ITEM 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

Financial Instruments Owned and Sold, Not Yet 
Purchased
Financial instruments owned and sold, not yet purchased, at fair value 
consist of financial instruments carried at fair value on a recurring 
basis or amounts that approximate fair value, with related realized 
and unrealized gains and losses recognized in current period earnings. 
Realized and unrealized gains and losses on financial instruments owned 
and sold, not yet purchased, are included in ‘Trading gains, net’ and 
‘Cost of sales of physical commodities’ in the consolidated income 
statements. The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at 
which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction 
between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.
Financial instruments owned and sold, not yet purchased are comprised 
primarily of the financial instruments held by the Company’s broker-
dealer subsidiaries and the Company’s over-the-counter (“OTC”) 
derivative swap dealer. Financial instruments owned and financial 
instruments sold, not yet purchased, includes trading securities that 
the Company holds as a principal. The Company has not classified any 
financial instruments owned or sold, not yet purchased, as available-
for-sale or held-to-maturity.
Financial instruments owned and sold, not yet purchased includes 
derivative instruments that the Company holds as a principal which 
are primarily transacted on an OTC basis. As a derivatives dealer, 
the Company utilizes derivative instruments to manage exposures 
to foreign currency, commodity price and interest rate risks for the 
Company and its clients. The Company’s objectives for holding 
derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing 
the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible. 
The Company’s derivative instruments also include forward purchase 
and sale commitments for the physical delivery of agricultural and 
energy related commodities in a future period. Contracts to purchase 
agricultural and energy commodities generally relate to the current 
or future crop year. Contracts for the sale of agricultural and energy 
commodities generally do not extend beyond one year.
Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and 
are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. As the Company does 
not elect hedge accounting for any derivative instruments, realized and 
unrealized gains and losses from the change in fair value of derivative 
instruments are recognized immediately in current period earnings. 
Realized and unrealized gains and losses from the derivative instruments 
in which the Company acts as a dealer are included within ‘Trading 
gains, net’ on the consolidated income statements. Realized and 
unrealized gains and losses on firm purchase and sale commitments 
are included within ‘Cost of sales of physical commodities’ on the 
consolidated income statements.
To reduce credit exposure on the derivative instruments for which 
the Company acts as a dealer, the Company may enter into a master 
netting arrangement that allows for settlement of all derivative 
transactions with each counterparty. In addition, the credit support 
annex that accompanies master netting arrangements allows parties to 
the master netting agreement to mitigate their credit risk by requiring 
the party which is out of the money to post collateral. The Company 
accepts collateral in the form of cash or other marketable securities. 
Where permitted, the Company elects to net-by-counterparty certain 
derivative instruments entered into under a legally enforceable master 
netting agreement and, therefore, the fair value of those derivative 

69

                                  - Form 10-KPART II 
ITEM 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

instruments are netted by counterparty in the consolidated balance 
sheets. As the Company elects to net-by-counterparty the fair value of 
such derivative instruments, the Company also nets-by-counterparty 
cash collateral exchanged as part of those derivative instruments.
The Company also brokers foreign exchange forwards, options and 
cash, or spot, transactions between clients and external counterparties. 
A portion of the contracts are arranged on an offsetting basis, limiting 
the Company’s risk to performance of the two offsetting parties. The 
offsetting nature of the contracts eliminates the effects of market 
fluctuations on the Company’s operating results. Due to the Company’s 
role as a principal participating in both sides of these contracts, the 
amounts are presented gross on the consolidated balance sheets at 
their respective fair values, net of offsetting assets and liabilities.
The Company holds proprietary positions in its foreign exchange line 
of business. On a limited basis, the Company’s foreign exchange trade 
desk will accept a client transaction and will offset that transaction 
with a similar but not identical position with a counterparty. These 
unmatched transactions are intended to be short-term in nature and 
are often conducted to facilitate the most effective transaction for the 
Company’s client. These spot and forward contracts are accounted for 
as free-standing derivatives and reported in the consolidated balance 
sheets at their fair values.
The Company may lease commodities to or from clients or 
counterparties. These commodity leases, which primarily involve 
precious metals, are recorded at fair value utilizing the fair value 
option based on guidance in the Financial Instruments Topic of the 
ASC. These commodities leases represent hybrid financial instruments 
which contain both a dollar denominated loan host contract and an 
embedded forward derivative contract on the underlying commodities, 
which can be settled in either cash or metals. As permitted by the fair 
value option election, the entire instrument is recorded at fair value 
as either an asset or liability in the consolidated balance sheets. The 
corresponding change in the fair value of the instrument is recognized 
in the consolidated income statements as a component of ‘trading 
gains, net’ for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2018, 2017, and 
2016. The Company does elect to value all of their commodities lease 
agreements at fair value using the fair value option.
For further information regarding the types of financial instruments 
owned and sold, not yet purchased, as well as the related valuation 
techniques refer to Note 3.

Exchange and Clearing Organization 
Memberships and Stock
The Company is required to hold certain exchange membership seats 
and exchange firm and clearing organization common stock and 
pledges them for clearing purposes, in order to provide the Company 
the right to process trades directly with the various exchanges and 
clearing organizations. Exchange memberships include seats on the 
Chicago Board of Trade (“CBOT”), the Minneapolis Grain Exchange, 
the New York Mercantile Exchange (“NYMEX”), the Commodity 
Exchange, Inc. (“COMEX”) Division of the New York Mercantile 
Exchange, Mercado de Valores de Buenos Aires S.A. (“MERVAL”), 
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (“CME”) Growth and Emerging 
Markets, InterContinental Exchange, Inc. (“ICE”) Futures US, ICE 
Europe Ltd and London Metal Exchange (“LME”). Exchange firm 
and clearing organization common stock include shares of CME 
Group, Inc., ICE, LME, and the Depository Trust & Clearing 
Corporation (“DTCC”).

70

Exchange and clearing organization memberships and firm common 
stocks required in order to conduct business on exchanges and clearing 
organizations are recorded at cost and are included in ‘other assets’ 
on the consolidated balance sheets. Equity investments in exchange 
firm common stock not required in order to conduct business on the 
exchanges are classified as trading securities included within ‘financial 
instruments owned’ on the consolidated balance sheets and recorded 
at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component 
of ‘trading gains, net’ on the consolidated income statements.
The cost basis for exchange and clearing organization memberships and 
firm common stock pledged for clearing purposes was $11.4 million 
and $12.0 million as of September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
The fair value of exchange and clearing organization memberships and 
firm common stock pledged for clearing purposes was $10.3 million 
and $10.2 million as of September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
The fair value of exchange and clearing organization firm common 
stock is determined by quoted market prices, and the fair value of 
exchange memberships is determined by recent sale transactions. The 
Company monitors the fair value of exchange and clearing organization 
membership seats and firm common stock on a quarterly basis, and 
does not consider any current unrealized losses on individual exchange 
and clearing organization memberships and firm common stock to 
be anything other than a temporary impairment.

Product Financing Arrangements
In the normal course of operations the Company executes notes 
receivable under repurchase agreements with clients whereby the clients 
sell certain commodity inventory or other investments to the Company 
and agree to repurchase the commodity inventory or investment at a 
future date at a fixed price. These transactions are short-term in nature, 
and in accordance with the guidance contained in the Transfers and 
Servicing Topic of the ASC, are treated as secured borrowings rather 
than commodity inventory and purchases and sales in the Company’s 
consolidated financial statements. These transactions are reflected as 
‘notes receivable’ in the consolidated balance sheet. Commodities or 
investments sold under repurchase agreements are reflected at the 
amount of cash received in connection with the transactions. The 
Company may be required to provide additional collateral based on 
the fair value of the underlying asset.
The Company also participates in commodity repurchase transactions 
that are accounted for as commodity inventory and purchases and 
sales of physical commodities as opposed to secured borrowings. The 
repurchase price under these arrangements is not fixed at the time of 
execution and, therefore, do not meet all the criteria to be accounted 
for as product financing arrangements.

Lenders Under Loans
Lenders under loans are accounted for at amortized cost, which 
approximates fair value due to their variable rates of interest.

Acquisitions
When acquiring companies, the Company recognizes separately from 
goodwill most of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities 
assumed at their acquisition date fair values. Certain contingent liabilities 
acquired require remeasurement at fair value in each subsequent 
reporting period. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the 

                                 - Form 10-Kexcess of consideration transferred and the net of the acquisition fair 
values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. While the Company 
used its best estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price 
allocation to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
at the acquisition date, these estimates are inherently uncertain and 
subject to refinement. As a result, during the remeasurement period, 
which may up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company 
records adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, 
with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon conclusion of the 
measurement period or final determination of the values of assets 
acquired and liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent 
adjustments are recorded to the consolidated income statements rather 
than adjusted through goodwill. Acquisition related costs, such as fees 
for attorneys, accountants, and investment bankers, are expensed as 
incurred and are not capitalized as part of the purchase price.
Determining the fair value of certain identifiable assets acquired and 
liabilities assumed is subjective in nature and often involves the use 
of significant estimates and assumptions. Estimating the fair value of 
the assets and liabilities acquired requires significant judgment. These 
estimates and assumptions are based in part on historical experience, 
market data, and information obtained from the management of the 
acquired companies. Among the significant estimates used to value 
certain identifiable intangible assets acquired in acquisitions include, 
but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer 
relationships and discount rates.

Contingent Consideration
The Company estimates and records the acquisition date estimated fair 
value of contingent consideration as part of purchase price consideration 
for acquisitions. Additionally, each reporting period, the Company 
estimates changes in the fair value of contingent consideration, and any 
change in fair value is recognized in the consolidated income statements. 
An increase in the contingent consideration expected to be paid will result 
in a charge to operations in the period that the anticipated fair value 
of contingent consideration increases, while a decrease in the earn-out 
expected to be paid will result in a credit to operations in the period 
that the anticipated fair value of contingent consideration decreases. The 
estimate of the fair value of contingent consideration requires subjective 
assumptions to be made of future operating results, discount rates, and 
probabilities assigned to various potential operating result scenarios.

Additional Paid-In Capital
The Company’s additional paid-in capital (“APIC”) consists of 
stockholder contributions that are in excess of par value of common 
stock. Included in APIC are amounts related to the exercise of stock 
options and amortization of share-based compensation.

Revenue Recognition

Sales of physical commodities
Sales of physical commodities revenue are recognized when persuasive 
evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee 
is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. 
The Company reports its physical commodities revenues, except as 
described below, on a gross basis, with the corresponding cost of sales 

PART II 
ITEM 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

shown separately, in accordance with the guidelines provided in the 
Revenue Recognition Topic of the ASC. Management has historically 
assessed the performance of the physical commodities businesses on 
an operating revenue basis, and continues to do so.
INTL FCStone Ltd precious metals sales and cost of sales are presented 
on a net basis and included as a component of ‘trading gains, net’ in 
the consolidated income statements, in accordance with U.S GAAP 
accounting requirements for broker-dealers. Precious metals sales and 
cost of sales for subsidiaries that are not broker-dealers continue to 
be recorded on a gross basis.

Trading gains, net
Trading gains, net include brokerage fees and margins generated from 
OTC derivative trades executed with clients and other counterparties 
and are recognized when trades are executed. Trading gains, net also 
include activities where the Company acts as principal in the purchase 
and sale of individual securities, currencies, commodities or derivative 
instruments. These transactions may be offset simultaneously with 
another client or counterparty, offset with similar but not identical 
positions on an exchange, made from inventory, or may be aggregated 
with other purchases to provide liquidity intraday, for a number of 
days, or in some cases even longer periods (during which fair value may 
fluctuate). In addition, trading gains, net includes activities from the 
Company’s operations of a proprietary foreign exchange desk which 
arbitrages the futures and cash markets (see additional discussion in 
the Financial Instruments Owned and Sold, Not Yet Purchased policy 
note for revenue recognition on principal trading activities). Net 
dealer inventory and investment gains are recognized on a trade-date 
basis and include realized gains or losses and changes in unrealized 
gains or losses on investments at fair value. Dividend income on long 
equity positions and dividend expense on short equity positions are 
recognized net in ‘trading gains, net’ on the ex-dividend date.

Commission and clearing fees
The Company generates two types of commission revenues: sales-
based commissions and trailing commissions.
Sales-based commission revenues, which occur when the Company 
executes and clears securities, futures, and options on futures transactions 
on behalf of clients in an agency capacity, primarily represent commissions 
that are recognized on a trade-date basis. Sales-based commissions are 
generated by internal traders and brokers or by introducing broker-
dealers. Sales-based commissions are reported gross of introducing-broker 
dealer and registered investment advisor commissions.
Certain commissions on futures contracts are recognized on a half-turn 
basis in two equal parts. The first half is recognized when the contract 
is opened and the second half is recognized when the transaction is 
closed. Commissions on options on futures contracts are generally 
recognized on a half-turn basis, except that full commissions are 
recognized on options expected to expire without being exercised or 
offset. Commissions and transactions fees are charged at various rates 
based on the type of account, the products traded, and the method 
of trade. Clearing and transaction fees are charged to clients on a 
per contract basis based on the trade-date. These fees are for clearing 
clients’ trades and include fees charged to the Company by the various 
futures exchanges, securities clearing organizations, and other regulatory 
organizations and are reported gross of the transaction-based clearing 
expenses discussed below.

ITEM 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

Trailing commission revenues from mutual funds, annuities, and 
insurance products are recorded over the period earned. Trailing 
commission revenues, or commissions that are paid over time, such as 
12(b)-1 fees are recurring in nature and are earned based on varying 
factors that are product specific to trail-eligible assets. The Company 
earns trailing commission revenues primarily on mutual funds, 
annuities, and insurance products held by clients of the Company’s 
registered investment advisors.

Consulting, management, and account fees
Consulting, management, and account fees include risk management 
consulting fees which are billed and recognized as revenue on a monthly 
basis when risk management services are provided. Such agreements 
are generally for one year periods, but are generally cancelable by either 
party upon providing thirty days written notice to the other party 
and the amounts are not variable based on client trading activities.
Fee income for structuring and arrangement of debt transactions 
and management and investment advisory income is recorded when 
the services related to the underlying transactions are provided and 
success fees are recorded when complete, as determined under the 
terms of the assignment or engagement.
Consulting, management, and account fees also includes various 
charges related to securities clearing agreements with unaffiliated 
introducing-broker dealers such as transaction fees, annual account 
fees, service charges, servicing fees, platform fees, money market 
processing and distribution fees, and other correspondent clearing 
fees. The annual account fees such as IRA fees and distribution fees are 
recognized as earned over the term of the contract. The transaction fees 
are earned and collected from clients as trades are executed. Servicing 
fees such as omnibus fees are paid to the Company for marketing and 
administrative services and are recognized as earned.
Consulting, management, and account fees also includes fund 
management fees which are earned over the period in which services 
are rendered. The fund management fees earned are calculated monthly 
based upon an average of net assets under management in accordance 
with such investment management agreements.
Consulting, management, and account fees also includes asset 
management, or administration, fees generated from the Company’s 
registered investment advisor platform based upon the value of their 
advisory assets. Asset management, or administration, fees are generally 
billed to clients at the beginning of the quarter and are recognized as 
revenue ratably over the quarter. The majority of accounts are billed 
in advance using values as of the last business day of each calendar 
quarter. The market value of the assets in an account on the billing 
date determines the amount billed, and accordingly, the revenues 
earned in the following three month period.
Additionally, the Company earns fees generated in lieu of interest 
income from a multi-bank sweep program with unaffiliated banks. 
Pursuant to contractual arrangements with securities introducing-broker 
dealers, uninvested cash balances in the introducing -brokers client 
accounts are swept into either FDIC insured cash accounts at various 
banks or third-party money market funds for which the Company 
earns a portion of the interest income generated by the balances. 
The fees generated by the Company’s multi-bank sweep program are 
reported net of the balances remitted to the introducing-brokers and 
the clients of introducing-brokers.

72

Interest Income
Interest income is recognized on an accrual basis. Interest income is 
generated from client funds deposited with the Company to satisfy 
margin requirements which is held by banks or pledged to exchange-
clearing organizations. Interest income is also generated from the 
investment of client funds in U.S. Treasury obligations. Interest income 
generated from client funds is reported gross of the interest remitted 
to the clients. Interest is also generated from trading fixed income 
securities that the Company holds in its market-making businesses. 
Interest income also includes interest generated from collateralized 
transactions, including securities borrowed and securities purchased 
under agreements to resell, and from extending margin loans to clients.
Revenue generally is recognized net of any taxes collected from clients 
and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.

Cost of Sales of Physical Commodities
Cost of sales of physical commodities include finished commodity or 
raw material and processing costs along with operating costs relating 
to the receipt, storage and delivery of the physical commodities. 
Cost of sales of physical commodities also includes changes in the 
fair value of agricultural commodity inventories held for sale, and 
related forward purchase and sale commitments and exchange-traded 
futures and options contracts.

Interest Expense
Interest expense is recognized on an accrual basis. As noted above, 
interest income is generated from client funds deposited with the 
Company to satisfy margin requirements which is held by banks 
or pledged to exchange-clearing organizations. Interest income is 
also generated from the investment of client funds in U.S. Treasury 
obligations. A portion of the interest income generated from these 
funds is remitted to the clients. Interest expense is also incurred on 
outstanding balances on the Company’s credit facilities. Interest expense 
is also incurred on fixed income securities sold, not yet purchased, 
that the Company holds in its market-marking businesses. Interest 
expense is also incurred from collateralized transactions, including 
securities loaned and securities sold under agreements to repurchase.

Compensation and Benefits
Compensation and benefits consists primarily of salaries, incentive 
compensation, variable compensation, including commissions, 
related payroll taxes and employee benefits. The Company classifies 
employees as either risk management consultants / traders, operational 
or administrative personnel, which includes the executive officers. 
Variable compensation paid to risk management consultants and traders 
generally represents a fixed percentage of revenues generated, and in some 
cases, revenues produced less direct costs and an overhead allocation. 
The Company accrues commission expense on a trade-date basis.

Share-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for share-based compensation in accordance 
with the guidance of the Compensation-Stock Compensation Topic 
of the ASC. The cost of employee services received in exchange for a 

                                 - Form 10-KPART II 
ITEM 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

share-based award is generally measured based on the grant-date fair 
value of the award. Share-based employee awards that require future 
service are amortized over the relevant service period. Forfeitures are 
accounted for as they occur in determining share-based employee 
compensation expense. For option awards granted, compensation 
cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period for 
the entire award.

Comprehensive Income
Comprehensive income consists of net income and other gains and 
losses affecting stockholders’ equity that, under U.S. GAAP, are excluded 
from net income. Other comprehensive income (loss) includes net 
actuarial gains and losses from defined benefit pension plans and 
gains and losses on foreign currency translations.

Transaction-Based Clearing Expenses
Clearing fees and related expenses include primarily variable expenses 
for clearing and settlement services, including fees the Company 
pays to executing brokers, exchanges, clearing organizations and 
banks. These fees are based on transaction volume, and recorded as 
expense on the trade date. Clearing fees are passed on to clients and 
are presented gross in the consolidated statements of income under 
the Revenue Recognition Topic of the ASC, as the Company acts as 
a principal for these transactions.

Introducing Broker Commissions
Introducing broker commissions include commissions paid to non-
employee third parties that have introduced clients to the Company. 
Introducing brokers are individuals or organizations that maintain 
relationships with clients and accept futures and options orders from 
those clients. The Company directly provides all account, transaction 
and margining services to introducing brokers, including accepting 
money, securities and property from the clients. The commissions 
are determined and settled monthly.

Income Taxes
Income tax expense includes U.S. federal, state and local and foreign 
income taxes. Certain items of income and expense are not reported in 
tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The objectives of 
accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable 
or refundable for the current year. The Company utilizes the asset and 
liability method to provide income taxes on all transactions recorded in 
the consolidated financial statements. This method requires that income 
taxes reflect the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences 
between the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities for book and tax 
purposes. Accordingly, a deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary 
difference is determined based on the tax rates that the Company expects 
to be in effect when the underlying items of income and expense are 
realized. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of 
events that have been recognized in the Company’s financial statements 
or tax returns, including the repatriation of undistributed earnings of 
foreign subsidiaries. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, 
management considers whether it is more likely than not that some or all 
of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company recognizes 
the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely 
than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the 
taxing authority, based upon the technical merits of the position. The tax 
benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a 
position is measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 
50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. See Note 
18 for further information on the Company’s income taxes.

Preferred Stock
The Company is authorized to issue one million shares of preferred 
stock, par value of $0.01 per share, in one or more classes or 
series to be established by the Company’s board of directors. As of 
September 30, 2018 and 2017, no preferred shares were outstanding 
and the Company’s board of directors had not yet established any 
class or series of shares.

Accounting Standards Adopted
In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) 
issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-09, 
“Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements 
to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting” (“ASU 2016-09”), 
which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based 
payment transactions. Under ASU 2016-09, excess tax benefits and 
tax deficiencies are recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the 
income statement instead of additional paid in capital. ASU 2016-09 
also provides entities with the option to elect an accounting policy 
to estimate forfeitures of share-based awards over the service period 
or account for forfeitures when they occur. Under ASU 2016-09, 
previously unrecognized excess tax benefits should be recognized 
using a modified retrospective transition. In addition, amendments 
requiring recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies in the 
income statement, as well as changes in the computation of weighted-
average diluted shares outstanding, should be applied prospectively. 
ASU 2016-09 is effective for and was adopted by the Company in 
the first quarter of 2018 and the impact of the adoption resulted in 
the following:
•• During the year ended September 30, 2018, the Company recognized 
excess tax benefits from share-based compensation of $0.5 million 
within income tax expense on the consolidated income statement 
and within net income on the consolidated cash flow statement. 
Prior to adoption, the tax effect of share-based awards would have 
been recognized in additional paid-in-capital on the consolidated 
balance sheets and separately stated in the financing activities in 
the consolidated cash flow statements. The Company has elected 
to adopt this guidance prospectively.
•• The Company has elected to account for forfeitures of share-based 
awards as they occur. The Company elected to account for forfeitures 
as they occur using a modified retrospective transition method. The 
adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the 
consolidated financial statements.
•• The excess tax benefits from the assumed proceeds available to 
repurchase shares were excluded in the computation of diluted 
earnings per share for the year ended September 30, 2018. The 
Company has elected to adopt this guidance prospectively.

•• For the year ended September 30, 2018, the Company has classified 
as a financing activity in the consolidated cash flow statement 
$0.8 million of cash paid to taxing authorities for restricted stock 
shares withheld to satisfy statutory income tax withholding obligations. 
The retrospective application of this guidance had no impact on the 
consolidated cash flow statements for the years ended September 30, 
2017 and 2016.
In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, “Simplifying 
the Measurement of Inventory (Topic 330).” Under ASU 2015-11, 
inventory that is measured using the first-in, first-out (FIFO), specific 
identification, or average cost methods should be measured at the lower 
of cost or net realizable value. This ASU does not impact inventory 
measurement under the last-in, first-out (LIFO) or retail inventory 
methods. The Company adopted this ASU prospectively in the first 
quarter of 2018. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material 
impact on the consolidated financial statements.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, “Fair Value 
Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the 
Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement”, which aims 

to improve the overall usefulness of disclosures to financial statement 
users and reduce unnecessary costs to companies when preparing 
fair value measurement disclosures. This ASU is effective for all 
entities for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after 
December 15, 2019. Retrospective adoption is required except for 
changes in disclosures related to changes in unrealized gains and losses 
included in other comprehensive income for Level 3 instruments, the 
range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to 
develop Level 3 fair value measurements, and the narrative description 
of measurement uncertainty. Early adoption is permitted. An entity 
may early adopt eliminated or modified disclosure requirements and 
delay adoption of the additional disclosure requirements until their 
effective date. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Company 
early adopted the eliminated disclosure requirements related to the 
amount of and reasons for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 
of the fair value hierarchy, the timing of transfers between levels of 
the fair value hierarchy, and the valuation processes for Level 3 fair 
value measurements. The early adoption of the eliminated disclosure 
requirements did not have a material impact on the Company’s fair 
value measurement disclosures included within Note 3.

NOTE 2  Earnings per Share

The Company presents basic and diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) 
using the two-class method which requires all outstanding unvested 
share-based payment awards that contain rights to non-forfeitable 
dividends and therefore participate in undistributed earnings with 
common stockholders be included in computing earnings per share. 
Under the two-class method, net income is reduced by the amount 
of dividends declared in the period for each class of common stock 
and participating security. The remaining undistributed earnings are 
then allocated to common stock and participating securities, based 

on their respective rights to receive dividends. Restricted stock awards 
granted to certain employees and directors contain non-forfeitable rights 
to dividends at the same rate as common stock, and are considered 
participating securities. Basic EPS has been computed by dividing 
net income by the weighted-average number of common shares 
outstanding. The following is a reconciliation of the numerator and 
denominator of the diluted net income per share computations for 
the periods presented below.

NOTE 3  Assets and Liabilities, at Fair Value

Fair value is defined by U.S. GAAP as the exchange price that would 
be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in 
the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability 
in an orderly transaction between willing market participants on the 
measurement date.
Fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of 
a market participant rather than an entity-specific measure. Therefore, 
even when market assumptions are not readily available, the Company 
is required to develop a set of assumptions that reflect those that 
market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the 
measurement date. The Company uses prices and inputs that are 
current as of the measurement date, including periods of market 
dislocation. In periods of market dislocation, the observability of 
prices and inputs may be reduced for many securities. This condition 
could cause a security to be reclassified to a lower level within the 
fair value hierarchy.
The Company has designed independent price verification controls 
and periodically performs such controls to ensure the reasonableness 
of such values.
In accordance with FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, the 
Company groups its assets and liabilities measured at fair value in 
three levels based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities 
are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine 
fair value. These levels are:
Level 1 - Valuation is based upon unadjusted quoted prices in active 
markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, 
unrestricted assets or liabilities. Level 1 consists of financial assets and 
liabilities whose fair values are estimated using quoted market prices.
Level 2 - Valuation is based upon quoted prices for identical or similar 
assets or liabilities in markets that are less active, that is, markets in 
which there are few transactions for the asset or liability that are 
observable for substantially the full term. Included in Level 2 are 
those financial assets and liabilities for which fair values are estimated 
using models or other valuation methodologies. These models are 
primarily industry-standard models that consider various observable 
inputs, including time value, yield curve, volatility factors, observable 
current market and contractual prices for the underlying financial 
instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures.
Level 3 - Valuation is generated from prices or valuation techniques that 
require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement 
and unobservable (i.e., supported by little or no market activity). 
Level 3 comprises financial assets and liabilities whose fair value is 
estimated based on internally developed models or methodologies 
utilizing significant inputs that are not readily observable from 
objective sources.
Financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities are classified in their 
entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the 
fair value measurement. The hierarchy gives the highest priority 
to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets 
or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to 
unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). A market is active if 
there are sufficient transactions on an ongoing basis to provide current 
pricing information for the asset or liability, pricing information 
is released publicly, and price quotations do not vary substantially 

PART II 
ITEM 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

either over time or among market makers. Observable inputs reflect 
the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset 
or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources 
independent of the reporting entity.
The guidance requires the Company to consider counterparty credit 
risk of all parties of outstanding derivative instruments that would 
be considered by a market participant in the transfer or settlement 
of such contracts (exit price). The Company’s exposure to credit risk 
on derivative financial instruments relates to the portfolio of OTC 
derivative contracts as all exchange-traded contracts held can be 
settled on an active market with a credit guarantee from the respective 
exchange. The Company requires each counterparty to deposit margin 
collateral for all OTC instruments and is also required to deposit 
margin collateral with counterparties. The Company has assessed 
the nature of these deposits and used its discretion to adjust each 
based on the underlying credit considerations for the counterparty 
and determined that the collateral deposits minimize the exposure 
to counterparty credit risk in the evaluation of the fair value of OTC 
instruments as determined by a market participant.

Fair value of financial and nonfinancial 
assets and liabilities that are carried on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value on 
a recurring basis
Cash and cash equivalents reported at fair value on a recurring basis 
includes certificates of deposit, which are stated at cost plus accrued 
interest, which approximates fair value.
Cash, securities and other assets segregated under federal and other 
regulations reported at fair value on a recurring basis include the 
value of pledged investments, primarily U.S. Treasury obligations 
and commodities warehouse receipts.
Deposits with and receivables from broker-dealers, clearing organizations 
and counterparties and payable to clients and broker-dealers, clearing 
organizations and counterparties includes the fair value of pledged 
investments, primarily U.S. Treasury obligations and foreign government 
obligations. These balances also include the fair value of exchange-
traded options on futures and OTC forwards, swaps, and options.
Financial instruments owned and sold, not yet purchased include the 
fair value of equity securities, which includes common, preferred, and 
foreign ordinary shares, American Depository Receipts (“ADRs”), 
Global Depository Receipts (“GDRs”), and exchange-traded funds 
(“ETFs”), corporate and municipal bond, U.S. Treasury obligations, 
U.S. government agency obligations, foreign government obligations, 
agency mortgage-backed obligations, asset-backed obligations, derivative 
financial instruments, commodities warehouse receipts, exchange 
firm common stock, and mutual funds and investments in managed 
funds. The fair value of exchange firm common stock is determined 
by quoted market prices, and the fair value of exchange memberships 
is determined by recent sale transactions.
Cash equivalents, securities, commodities warehouse receipts, physical 
commodities inventory, derivative financial instruments and contingent 
liabilities are carried at fair value, on a recurring basis, and are classified 
and disclosed into three levels in the fair value hierarchy.

ITEM 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

The following section describes the valuation methodologies used by 
the Company to measure classes of financial instruments at fair value 
and specifies the level within the fair value hierarchy where various 
financial instruments are classified.
The Company uses quoted prices in active markets, where available, 
and classifies such instruments within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. 
Examples include U.S. Treasury obligations, foreign government 
obligations, commodities warehouse receipts, certain equity securities 
traded in active markets, physical precious metals inventory, equity 
investments in exchange firms, investments in managed funds, as 
well as options on futures contracts traded on national exchanges. 
The fair value of exchange memberships is determined by recent sale 
transactions and is included within Level 1.
When instruments are traded in secondary markets and observable 
prices are not available for substantially the full term, the Company 
generally relies on internal valuation techniques or prices obtained from 
third-party pricing services or brokers or a combination thereof, and 
accordingly, classified these instruments as Level 2. Examples include 
corporate and municipal bonds, U.S. government agency obligations, 
agency-mortgage backed obligations, asset-backed obligations, certain 
equity securities traded in less active markets, OTC commodity, 
interest rate, and foreign exchange forwards, swaps, and options, and 
OTC firm purchase and sale commitments related to the Company’s 
agricultural and energy commodities.
Certain derivatives without a quoted price in an active market and 
derivatives executed OTC are valued using internal valuation techniques, 
including pricing models which utilize significant inputs observable 
to market participants. The valuation techniques and inputs depend 
on the type of derivative and the nature of the underlying instrument. 
The key inputs depend upon the type of derivative and the nature of 
the underlying instrument and include interest yield curves, foreign 
exchange rates, commodity prices, volatilities and correlation. These 
derivative instruments are included within Level 2 of the fair value 
hierarchy.
Physical commodities inventory includes precious metals that are a part 
of the trading activities of a regulated broker-dealer subsidiary and is 
recorded at net realizable value using exchange-quoted prices. Physical 
commodities inventory also includes agricultural commodities that 
are a part of the trading activities of a non-broker dealer subsidiary 
and are also recorded at net realizable value using exchange-quoted 
prices. The fair value of precious metals physical commodities inventory 
is based upon unadjusted exchange-quoted prices and is, therefore, 
classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of 
agricultural physical commodities inventory and the related OTC firm 
sale and purchase commitments are generally based upon exchange-
quoted prices, adjusted for basis or differences in local markets, 
broker or dealer quotations or market transactions in either listed 

or OTC markets. Exchange-quoted prices are adjusted for location 
and quality because the exchange-quoted prices for agricultural and 
energy related products represent contracts that have standardized 
terms for commodity, quantity, future delivery period, delivery 
location, and commodity quality or grade. The basis or local market 
adjustments are observable inputs or have an insignificant impact on 
the measurement of fair value and, therefore, the agricultural physical 
commodities inventory as well as the related OTC forward firm sale 
and purchase commitments have been included within Level 2 of 
the fair value hierarchy.
With the exception of certain derivative instruments, financial 
instruments owned and sold are primarily valued using third party 
pricing sources. Third party vendors compile prices from various 
sources and often apply matrix pricing for similar securities when no 
prices are observable. The Company reviews the pricing methodologies 
provided by the various vendors in order to determine if observable 
market information is being used, versus unobservable inputs. When 
evaluating the propriety of an internal trader price compared with 
vendor prices, considerations include the range and quality of vendor 
prices. Trader or broker prices are used to ensure the reasonableness 
of a vendor price; however valuing financial instruments involves 
judgments acquired from knowledge of a particular market. If a trader 
asserts that a vendor or market price is not reflective of market value, 
justification for using the trader or broker price, including recent 
sales activity where possible, must be provided to and approved by 
the appropriate levels of management. Financial instruments owned 
and sold that are valued using third party pricing sources are included 
within either Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy based 
upon the observability of the inputs used and the level of activity 
in the market.
Level 3 comprises financial assets and liabilities whose fair value is 
estimated based on internally developed models or methodologies 
utilizing significant inputs that are not readily observable from 
objective sources. As of September 30, 2017, included in Level 3 
were certain equity securities and contingent liabilities. Level 3 assets 
and liabilities were valued using an income approach based upon 
management developed discounted cash flow projections, which 
are an unobservable input. The Company had no Level 3 assets and 
liabilities as of September 30, 2018, as the balances were settled during 
the year ended September 30, 2018.
The fair value estimates presented herein are based on pertinent 
information available to management as of September 30, 2018 and 
2017. Although management is not aware of any factors that would 
significantly affect the estimated fair value amounts, such amounts 
have not been comprehensively revalued for purposes of these financial 
statements since that date and current estimates of fair value may 
differ significantly from the amounts presented herein.

The Company had debentures issued by a single asset owning 
company of Suriwongse Hotel located in Chiang Mai, Thailand. As 
of September 30, 2016, the Company’s investment in the hotel was 
$3.0 million, and was included within the corporate and municipal 
bonds classification in the Level 3 financial assets and financial 
liabilities table. The Company classified its investment in the hotel 
within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because the fair value was 
determined using significant unobservable inputs, which included 
projected cash flows. These cash flows were discounted employing 
present value techniques. In December 2016, the Company sold the 
debentures and collected an amount approximating their carrying value.
The Company was required to make additional future cash payments 
based on certain financial performance measures of an acquired business. 
The Company was required to remeasure the fair value of the contingent 
consideration on a recurring basis. As of September 30, 2017, the 
Company had classified its liability for the contingent consideration 
within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because the fair value was 
determined using significant unobservable inputs, which included 
projected cash flows. These cash flows were discounted employing 
present value techniques in arriving at fair value. The fair value of the 
contingent consideration increased by $0.1 million during the year 
ended September 30, 2017, with the corresponding amount classified 

as ‘other’ in the consolidated income statement. The contingency 
period for the contingent consideration ended as of December 31, 
2017, and the accrued balance of $1.0 million was paid during the 
year ended September 30, 2018.
The value of an exchange-traded derivative contract is equal to the 
unrealized gain or loss on the contract determined by marking the 
contract to the current settlement price for a like contract on the 
valuation date of the contract. A settlement price may not be used if 
the market makes a limit move with respect to a particular derivative 
contract or if the securities underlying the contract experience significant 
price fluctuations after the determination of the settlement price. 
When a settlement price cannot be used, derivative contracts will 
be valued at their fair value as determined in good faith pursuant to 
procedures adopted by management of the Company.
The Company has classified equity investments in exchange firms’ 
common stock not pledged for clearing purposes as trading securities. 
The investments are recorded at fair value, with unrealized gains and 
losses recorded, net of taxes, included in earnings. As of September 30, 
2018, the cost and fair value of the equity investments in exchange firms 
is $3.7 million and $10.2 million, respectively. As of September 30, 
2017, the cost and fair value of the equity investments in exchange 
firms was $3.9 million and $8.3 million, respectively.

Additional disclosures about the fair value of 
financial instruments that are not carried on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value
Many, but not all, of the financial instruments that the Company 
holds are recorded at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
The following represents financial instruments in which the ending 
balance at September 30, 2018 and 2017 was not carried at fair value 
in accordance with U.S. GAAP on our Consolidated Balance Sheets:

Short-term financial instruments
The carrying value of short-term financial instruments, including 
cash and cash equivalents, cash segregated under federal and other 
regulations, securities purchased under agreements to re-sell and 
securities sold under agreements to re-purchase, and securities borrowed 
and loaned are recorded at amounts that approximate the fair value 
of these instruments due to their short-term nature and level of 
collateralization. These financial instruments generally expose us to 
limited credit risk and have no stated maturities or have short-term 
maturities and carry interest rates that approximate market rates. 
Under the fair value hierarchy, cash and cash equivalents and cash 
segregated under federal and other regulations are classified as Level 1. 
Securities purchased under agreements to re-sell and securities sold 
under agreements to re-purchase, and securities borrowed and loaned 

are classified as Level 2 under the fair value hierarchy as they are 
generally overnight and are collateralized by common stock, U.S. 
Treasury obligations, U.S. government agency obligations, agency 
mortgage-backed obligations, and asset-backed obligations.

Receivables and other assets
Receivables from broker-dealers, clearing organizations, and 
counterparties, receivables from clients, net, notes receivables, net 
and certain other assets are recorded at amounts that approximate 
fair value due to their short-term nature and are classified as Level 2 
under the fair value hierarchy.

Payables
Payables to clients and payables to brokers-dealers, clearing organizations, 
and counterparties are recorded at amounts that approximate fair value 
due to their short-term nature and are classified as Level 2 under the 
fair value hierarchy.

Lender under loans
Payables to lenders under loans carry variable rates of interest and 
thus approximate fair value and are classified as Level 2 under the 
fair value hierarchy.

NOTE 4  Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk and Concentrations 

of Credit Risk

The Company is party to certain financial instruments with off-balance 
sheet risk in the normal course of its business. The Company has sold 
financial instruments that it does not currently own and will therefore 
be obliged to purchase such financial instruments at a future date. 
The Company has recorded these obligations in the consolidated 
financial statements as of September 30, 2018 at the fair values of 
the related financial instruments. The Company will incur losses 
if the fair value of the underlying financial instruments increases 
subsequent to September 30, 2018. The total of $866.5 million as of 
September 30, 2018 includes $193.4 million for derivative contracts, 
which represent a liability to the Company based on their fair values 
as of September 30, 2018.

Derivatives
The Company utilizes derivative products in its trading capacity 
as a dealer in order to satisfy client needs and mitigate risk. The 
Company manages risks from both derivatives and non-derivative cash 
instruments on a consolidated basis. The risks of derivatives should 
not be viewed in isolation, but in aggregate with the Company’s other 

trading activities. The Company’s derivative positions are included in 
the consolidating balance sheets in ‘deposits with and receivables from 
broker-dealers, clearing organizations, and counterparties’, ‘financial 
instruments owned and sold, not yet purchased, at fair value’ and 
‘payables to broker-dealers, clearing organizations and counterparties’.
The Company employs an interest rate risk management strategy 
using derivative financial instruments in the form of interest rate 
swaps as well as outright purchases of medium-term U.S. Treasury 
notes to manage a portion of the aggregate interest rate position. The 
Company’s objective when using interest rate swaps under the strategy, 
is to invest certain amounts of customer deposits in high quality, short-
term investments and swap the resulting variable interest earnings 
into medium-term interest earnings. When used, the risk mitigation 
of these interest rate swaps are not within the documented hedging 
designation requirements of the Derivatives and Hedging Topic of 
the ASC, and as a result are recorded at fair value, with changes in 
the fair value of the interest rate swaps recorded within ‘trading gains, 
net’ in the consolidated income statements. Currently, the Company 
holds no U.S. Treasury notes or interest rate swap derivative contracts 
as part of this strategy.

(1)  As of September 30, 2018 and 2017, the Company’s derivative contract volume for open positions was approximately 10.6 million and 6.1 million contracts, respectively.

The Company’s derivative contracts are principally held in its Commodities 
and Risk Management Services (“Commercial Hedging”) segment. The 
Company assists its Commercial Hedging segment clients in protecting 
the value of their future production by entering into option or forward 
agreements with them on an OTC basis. The Company also provides its 
Commercial Hedging segment clients with option products, including 
combinations of buying and selling puts and calls. The Company mitigates 
its risk by generally offsetting the client’s transaction simultaneously 
with one of the Company’s trading counterparties or will offset that 
transaction with a similar but not identical position on the exchange. The 
risk mitigation of these offsetting trades is not within the documented 
hedging designation requirements of the Derivatives and Hedging 
Topic of the ASC. These derivative contracts are traded along with cash 
transactions because of the integrated nature of the markets for these 
products. The Company manages the risks associated with derivatives 
on an aggregate basis along with the risks associated with its proprietary 
trading and market-making activities in cash instruments as part of its 
firm-wide risk management policies. In particular, the risks related to 
derivative positions may be partially offset by inventory, unrealized 
gains in inventory or cash collateral paid or received.

The Company transacts in derivative instruments, which consist 
of futures, mortgage-backed TBA securities and forward settling 
transactions, that are used to manage risk exposures in the Company’s 
fixed income portfolio. The fair value of these transactions is recorded 
in deposits with and receivables from broker-dealers, clearing 
organizations, and counterparties. Realized and unrealized gains 
and losses on securities and derivative transactions are reflected in 
‘trading gains, net’.
The Company enters into TBA securities transactions for the sole 
purpose of managing risk associated with the purchase of mortgage 
pass-through securities. TBA securities are included within payables 
to broker-dealers, clearing organizations and counterparties. Forward 
settling securities represent non-regular way securities and are included 
in financial instruments owned and sold. As of September 30, 2018, 
TBA and forward settling securities recorded within deposits with 
and receivables from broker-dealers, clearing organizations, and 
counterparties are summarized as follows (in millions):

Unrealized gain on TBA securities purchased
Unrealized loss on TBA securities purchased
Unrealized gain on TBA securities sold
Unrealized loss on TBA securities sold

Credit Risk
In the normal course of business, the Company purchases and 
sells financial instruments, commodities and foreign currencies as 
either principal or agent on behalf of its clients. If either the client 
or counterparty fails to perform, the Company may be required 
to discharge the obligations of the nonperforming party. In such 
circumstances, the Company may sustain a loss if the fair value of 
the financial instrument or foreign currency is different from the 
contract value of the transaction.
The majority of the Company’s transactions and, consequently, the 
concentration of its credit exposure are with commodity exchanges, 
clients, broker-dealers and other financial institutions. These activities 
primarily involve collateralized and uncollateralized arrangements and 
may result in credit exposure in the event that a counterparty fails to 
meet its contractual obligations. The Company’s exposure to credit 
risk can be directly impacted by volatile financial markets, which 
may impair the ability of counterparties to satisfy their contractual 
obligations. The Company seeks to control its credit risk through a 
variety of reporting and control procedures, including establishing 
credit limits based upon a review of the counterparties’ financial 
condition and credit ratings. The Company monitors collateral levels 
on a daily basis for compliance with regulatory and internal guidelines 
and requests changes in collateral levels as appropriate.
The Company is a party to financial instruments in the normal course 
of its business through client and proprietary trading accounts in 
exchange-traded and OTC derivative instruments. These instruments 
are primarily the execution of orders for commodity futures, options 
on futures and forward foreign currency contracts on behalf of its 
clients, substantially all of which are transacted on a margin basis. 
Such transactions may expose the Company to significant credit risk 
in the event margin requirements are not sufficient to fully cover 
losses which clients may incur. The Company controls the risks 

NOTE 5  Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Deposits with and receivables from broker-dealers, clearing 
organizations, and counterparties, net, receivables from clients, 
net, and notes receivable, net include an allowance for doubtful 
accounts, which reflects the Company’s best estimate of probable 
losses inherent in the accounts. The Company provides for an 
allowance for doubtful accounts based on a specific-identification 
basis. The Company continually reviews its allowance for doubtful 
accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts related to deposits

associated with these transactions by requiring clients to maintain 
margin deposits in compliance with individual exchange regulations 
and internal guidelines. The Company monitors required margin 
levels daily and, therefore, may require clients to deposit additional 
collateral or reduce positions when necessary. The Company also 
establishes credit limits for clients, which are monitored daily. The 
Company evaluates each client’s creditworthiness on a case by case 
basis. Clearing, financing, and settlement activities may require the 
Company to maintain funds with or pledge securities as collateral 
with other financial institutions. Generally, these exposures to both 
clients and counterparties are subject to master netting, or client 
agreements, which reduce the exposure to the Company by permitting 
receivables and payables with such clients to be offset in the event of 
a client default. Management believes that the margin deposits held 
as of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017 were adequate to 
minimize the risk of material loss that could be created by positions 
held at that time. Additionally, the Company monitors collateral 
fair value on a daily basis and adjusts collateral levels in the event of 
excess market exposure.
Derivative financial instruments involve varying degrees of off-balance 
sheet market risk whereby changes in the fair values of underlying 
financial instruments may result in changes in the fair value of 
the financial instruments in excess of the amounts reflected in the 
consolidated balance sheets. Exposure to market risk is influenced by 
a number of factors, including the relationships between the financial 
instruments and the Company’s positions, as well as the volatility 
and liquidity in the markets in which the financial instruments 
are traded. The principal risk components of financial instruments 
include, among other things, interest rate volatility, the duration 
of the underlying instruments and changes in commodity pricing 
and foreign exchange rates. The Company attempts to manage its 
exposure to market risk through various techniques. Aggregate market 
limits have been established and market risk measures are routinely 
monitored against these limits.

results continuing to be satisfactory as set forth in the agreement. 
Unused portions of the margin line require a commitment fee of 
0.50% on the unused commitment. Borrowings under the margin 
line are on a demand basis and bear interest at the Base Rate, as

to the sole discretion of the lender. The facility bears interest at a rate 
per annum equal to such rate in respect of such day as determined 
by the bank in its sole discretion. In the event that the Company 
fails to pay the principal and interest on the scheduled due date, the 
facilities bear penalty interest at a rate equal to the Federal Funds 
rate plus 2%. The amounts borrowed under the facilities are payable

LIBOR plus 2.00%.

Senior Unsecured Notes
In July 2013, the Company completed an offering of $45.5 million 
aggregate principal amount of the Company’s 8.5% Senior Notes due 
2020 (the “Notes”). The net proceeds of the sale of the Notes were being 
used for general corporate purposes. The Notes bore interest at a rate of 
8.5% per year (payable quarterly on January 30, April 30, July 30 and 
October 30 of each year). The Notes were scheduled to mature on July 30, 
2020. The Company could redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at any 
time on and after July 30, 2016, at a redemption price equal to 100% 
of the principal amount redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to, 
but not including, the redemption date. The Company incurred debt 
issuance costs of $1.7 million in connection with the issuance of the 
Notes, which were being amortized over the term of the Notes.
On September 15, 2016, the Company provided notice, through 
the trustee of the Notes, to the record holders of the Notes that the 
Company would redeem the outstanding $45.5 million aggregate 
principal amount of the Notes in full. On October 15, 2016, 
the Company redeemed the Notes at a prices equal to 100% of the 
principal amount redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but 
not including, October 15, 2016. The remaining unamortized deferred 
financing costs of $1.0 million were written off in connection with the 
redemption of the Notes and are included in ‘interest expense’ in the 
consolidated income statement for the year ended September 30, 2017.

The following table sets forth a listing of credit facilities, the current committed amounts, as of the report date, on the facilities, and outstanding

ITEM 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

NOTE 11  Commitments and Contingencies

Legal and Regulatory Proceedings
Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements 
are issued, which may result in a loss to the Company but which 
will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail 
to occur. The Company assesses such contingent liabilities, and such 
assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing 
loss contingencies related to legal and regulatory proceedings that 
are pending against the Company or unasserted claims that may 
result in such proceedings, the Company’s legal counsel evaluates the 
perceived merits of any legal or regulatory proceedings or unasserted 
claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought 
or expected to be sought therein.
If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a 
material loss had been incurred at the date of the financial statements 
and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated 
liability would be accrued in the Company’s financial statements. If 
the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency 
is not probable, but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot 
be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, together with 
an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable and material, 
would be disclosed. Neither accrual nor disclosure is required for loss 
contingencies that are deemed remote. The Company accrues legal 
fees related to contingent liabilities as they are incurred.
From time to time and in the ordinary course of business, the 
Company is involved in various legal actions and proceedings, 
including tort claims, contractual disputes, employment matters, 
workers’ compensation claims and collections. The Company carries 
insurance that provides protection against certain types of claims, 
up to the limits of the respective policy. Additionally, the Company 
is subject to extensive regulation and supervision by U.S. federal 
and international governmental agencies and various self-regulatory 
organizations. The Company and its advisors periodically engage 
with such regulatory agencies and organizations, in the context of 
examinations or otherwise, to respond to inquiries, informational 
requests, and investigations. From time to time, such engagements 
result in regulatory complaints or other matters, the resolution of 
which can include fines and other remediation.
As of September 30, 2018 and 2017, the consolidated balance sheets 
include loss contingency accruals, recorded during and prior to these 
fiscal years then ended, which are not material, individually or in the 
aggregate, to the Company’s financial position or liquidity. In the 
opinion of management, possible exposure from loss contingencies 
in excess of the amounts accrued, and in addition to the possible 
losses discussed below, is not material to the Company’s earnings, 
financial position or liquidity.
The following is a summary of a significant legal matter involving 
the Company:

Sentinel Litigation
Prior to the July 1, 2015 merger into INTL FCStone Financial, our 
subsidiary, FCStone, LLC, had a portion of its excess segregated funds 
invested with Sentinel Management Group Inc. (“Sentinel”), a registered 
futures commission merchant (“FCM”) and an Illinois-based money 
manager that provided cash management services to other FCMs. In 
August 2007, Sentinel halted redemptions to clients and sold certain 
of the assets it managed to an unaffiliated third party at a significant 
discount. On August 17, 2007, subsequent to Sentinel’s sale of 
certain assets, Sentinel filed for bankruptcy protection. In aggregate, 
$15.5 million of FCStone, LLC’s $21.9 million in invested funds 
were returned to it before and after Sentinel’s bankruptcy petition. 
A further $2.0 million was held by the bankruptcy trustee in reserve 
in the name of FCStone, LLC.
In August 2008, the bankruptcy trustee of Sentinel filed adversary 
proceedings against FCStone, LLC, and a number of other FCMs, 
seeking recovery of pre- and post-petition transfers totaling 
$15.5 million.
On April 23, 2018, following ten years of legal proceedings and a 
final ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh 
Circuit against the trustee in favor of INTL FCStone Financial, the 
United States Supreme Court denied the trustee’s petition for writ of 
certiorari. Following this, on May 1, 2018, INTL FCStone Financial 
received funds from the reserve account in the amount of $2.0 million. 
This amount is presented in ‘Other gains’ in the consolidated income 
statement for the year ended September 30, 2018.
Our assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that 
have been deemed reasonable by management, but that may later 
prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events 
and circumstances may occur that might cause us to change those 
estimates and assumptions.

Contractual Commitments

Operating Leases
The Company is obligated under various noncancelable operating 
leases for the rental of office facilities, automobiles, service obligations 
and certain office equipment, and accounts for these lease obligations 
on a straight line basis. The expense associated with operating leases 
was $12.0 million, $11.3 million and $9.9 million, for fiscal years 
ended September 30, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The 
expenses associated with the operating leases and service obligations 
are reported in the consolidated income statements in ‘occupancy 
and equipment rental’, ‘transaction-based clearing expenses’ and 
‘other’ expenses.

Purchase Commitments
The Company determines an estimate of contractual purchase 
commitments in the ordinary course of business primarily for the 
purchase of precious metals and agricultural and energy commodities. 
Unpriced contract commitments have been estimated using 
September 30, 2018 fair values. The purchase commitments and 
other obligations as of September 30, 2018 for less than one year, 
one to three years and three to five years were $1,204.7 million, 
$1.7 million and $1.8 million, respectively. There were $2.0 million 
in purchase commitments and other obligations after five years as of 
September 30, 2018. The purchase commitments for less than one year 
will be offset by corresponding sales commitments of $1,406 million.

Exchange Member Guarantees
The Company is a member of various exchanges that trade and 
clear futures and option contracts. In connection with the Sterne 
acquisition, the Company is also a member of and provides guarantees 
to securities clearinghouses and exchanges in connection with client 
trading activities. Associated with its memberships, the Company may 
be required to pay a proportionate share of the financial obligations of 
another member who may default on its obligations to the exchanges. 
While the rules governing different exchange memberships vary, in 
general the Company’s guarantee obligations would arise only if the 
exchange had previously exhausted its resources. In addition, any 
such guarantee obligation would be apportioned among the other 
non-defaulting members of the exchange. Any potential contingent 
liability under these arrangements is not quantifiable and could exceed 
the cash and securities it has posted to the clearinghouse as collateral.

The Company has not recorded any contingent liability in the 
consolidated financial statements for these agreements and believes that 
any potential requirement to make payments under these agreements 
is remote.

Self-Insurance
The Company self-insures its costs related to medical and dental 
claims. The Company is self-insured, up to a stop loss amount, 
for eligible participating employees and retirees, and for qualified 
dependent medical and dental claims, subject to deductibles and 
limitations. Liabilities are recognized based on claims filed and an 
estimate of claims incurred but not reported. The Company has 
purchased stop-loss coverage to limit its exposure on a per claim 
basis and in aggregate in the event that aggregated actual claims 
would exceed 120% of actuarially estimated claims. The Company 
is insured for covered costs in excess of these limits. Although the 
ultimate outcome of these matters may exceed the amounts recorded 
and additional losses may be incurred, the Company does not believe 
that any additional potential exposure for such liabilities will have 
a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial 
position or results of operations. As of September 30, 2018 and 2017, 
the Company had $0.8 million accrued for self-insured medical and 
dental claims included in ‘accounts payable and other liabilities’ in 
the consolidated balance sheets.

would reduce net capital, subsequent to haircuts and charges, to an 

amount less than 120% of the greatest minimum requirement.
INTL FCStone Financial as a registered securities carrying broker 
dealer is also subject to Rule 15c3-3 of the Securities Exchange Act 
of 1934 (“Rule 15c3-3”), which requires the Company to maintain 
separate accounts for the benefit of securities clients and proprietary 
accounts of broker dealers (“PABs”). These client protection rules 
require the Company to maintain special reserve bank accounts 
(“SRBAs”) for the exclusive benefit of securities clients and PABs.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Commodity Exchange Act, funds 
deposited by clients of INTL FCStone Financial relating to their 
trading of futures and options on futures on a U.S. commodities 
exchange must be carried in separate accounts which are designated 
as segregated clients’ accounts. Pursuant to the requirements of

NOTE 13  Securities and Commodity Financing Transactions

The Company’s outstanding notes receivable in connection with 
repurchase agreements for agricultural and energy commodities, 
whereby the clients sell to the Company certain commodity inventory 
and agree to repurchase the commodity inventory at a future date at 
a fixed price were $1.9 million and $0.8 million as of September 30, 
2018 and 2017, respectively.
The Company enters into securities purchased under agreements 
to resell, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, securities 
borrowed and securities loaned transactions to, among other things, 
finance financial instruments, acquire securities to cover short positions, 
acquire securities for settlement, and to accommodate counterparties’ 

needs. These agreements are recorded as collateralized financings at 
their contractual amounts plus accrued interest. The related interest is 
recorded in the consolidated income statements as interest income or 
interest expense, as applicable. In connection with these agreements 
and transactions, it is the policy of the Company to receive or pledge 
cash or securities to adequately collateralize such agreements and 
transactions in accordance with general industry guidelines and 
practices. The value of the collateral is valued daily and the Company 
may require counterparties to deposit additional collateral or return 
collateral pledged, when appropriate. The carrying amounts of these 
agreements and transactions approximate fair value due to their 
short-term nature and the level of collateralization.

ITEM 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

The Company pledges financial instruments owned to collateralize 
repurchase agreements. At September 30, 2018 and 2017, financial 
instruments owned, at fair value of $123.0 million and $19.4 million, 
respectively, were pledged as collateral under repurchase agreements. 
The counterparty has the right to repledge the collateral in connection 
with these transactions. These financial instruments owned have been 
pledged as collateral and have been parenthetically disclosed on the 
consolidated balance sheet.
In addition, as of September 30, 2018 and 2017, the Company 
pledged financial instruments owned, at fair value of $1,481.1 million 
and $1,306.4 million, respectively, and securities received under 
reverse repurchase agreements of $369.8 million and $100.2 million, 
respectively, to cover collateral requirements for tri-party repurchase 
agreements. For these securities, the counterparties do not have the 
right to sell or repledge the collateral and, therefore, they have not 
been parenthetically disclosed on the consolidated balance sheet.
The Company also has repledged securities borrowed and client 
securities held under custodial clearing arrangements to collateralize 

securities loaned agreements with a fair value of $267.9 million and 
$108.4 million as of September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
Additionally, the Company has also pledged financial instruments 
owned of $27.1 million and $12.7 million as of September 30, 2018 
and 2017, respectively, to collateralize uncommitted loan facilities 
with certain banks as discussed further in Note 10.
At September 30, 2018 and 2017, the Company had accepted collateral 
that it is permitted by contract to sell or repledge. This collateral consists 
primarily of securities received in reverse repurchase agreements, 
securities borrowed agreements, and margin securities held on behalf of 
correspondent brokers. The fair value of such collateral at September 30, 
2018 and 2017 was $1,294.8 million and $631.7 million, respectively, 
of which $473.9 million and $306.9 million, respectively, was used to 
cover securities sold short which are recorded in financial instruments 
sold, not yet purchased on the consolidated balance sheet. In the normal 
course of business, this collateral is used by the Company to cover 
financial instruments sold, not yet purchased, to obtain financing in 
the form of repurchase agreements, and to meet counterparties’ needs 
under lending arrangements.

NOTE 14  Share-Based Compensation

Share-based compensation expense is included in ‘compensation and benefits’ in the consolidated income statements and totaled $6.6 million, 
$6.3 million and $5.1 million for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.

Stock Option Plans
The Company sponsors a stock option plan for its directors, officers, employees and consultants. The 2013 Stock Option Plan, which was 
approved by the Company’s Board of Directors and shareholders, authorizes the Company to issue stock options covering up to 1.0 million 
shares of the Company’s common stock. As of September 30, 2018, there were 0.6 million shares authorized for future grant under this plan. 
Awards that expire or are canceled generally become available for issuance again under the plan. The Company settles stock option exercises 
with newly issued shares of common stock.
Fair value is estimated at the grant date based on a Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model using the following weighted-average assumptions:

 
Expected stock price volatility
Expected dividend yield
Risk free interest rate
Average expected life (in years)
Expected stock price volatility rates are primarily based on the historical 
volatility. The Company has not paid dividends in the past and does 
not currently expect to do so in the future. Risk free interest rates 
are based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of 
grant for periods corresponding with the expected life of the option 
or award. The average expected life represents the estimated period of

NOTE 15  Retirement Plans

Defined Benefit Retirement Plans
The Company has a frozen qualified defined benefit pension plan 
(the “Qualified Plan”) and a nonqualified defined benefit pension 
plan (the “Nonqualified Plan”), and recognizes their funded status, 
measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan assets 
and the projected benefit obligation, in “other assets” or “accounts 
payable and other accrued liabilities” in the consolidated balance 
sheets, depending on the funded status of each plan.
The Qualified Plan assets, which are managed in a third-party trust, 
primarily consist of a diversified blend of approximately 80% debt 
securities and 20% equity investments and had a total fair value of 
$35.6 million and $36.3 million as of September 30, 2018 and 2017, 
respectively. All Qualified Plan assets fall within Level 2 of the fair 
value hierarchy. The benefit obligation associated with the Qualified 
Plan will vary over time only as a result of changes in market interest 
rates, the life expectancy of the plan participants, and benefit payments, 
since the accrual of benefits was suspended when the Qualified Plan 
was frozen in 2006. The benefit obligation was $32.5 million and 
$34.7 million and the discount rate assumption used in the measurement 
of this obligation was 4.20% and 3.75% as of September 30, 2018 
and 2017, respectively. Related to the Qualified Plan, the Company’s 
net liability for retirement costs had a funded status of $3.1 million 
and $1.6 million as of September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The Nonqualified Plan assets had a total fair value of less than 
$0.1 million as of September 30, 2018 and 2017. The benefit obligation 
associated with the Nonqualified Plan will vary over time only as a 
result of changes in market interest rates, the life expectancy of the plan 
participants, and benefit payments. There are no active participants 
in the Nonqualified plan. The benefit obligation was $1.6 million 
and $1.8 million as of September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
Related to the Nonqualified Plan, the Company’s unfunded pension 
obligation was $1.6 million and $1.7 million as of September 30, 
2018 and 2017, respectively.

92

The Company recognized a net periodic benefit $0.2 million and 
$0.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, 
respectively. The net periodic benefit cost associated with the plans 
was $0.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2016. The expected 
long-term return on plan assets assumption is 4.50% for 2018. The 
Company made contributions of $1.0 million and $2.0 million to the 
plans in the years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The 
Company complies with minimum funding requirements. The estimated 
undiscounted future benefit payments are expected to be $2.1 million 
in 2019, $2.0 million in 2020, $2.0 million in 2021, $2.0 million in 
2022, $2.0 million in 2023 and $9.7 million in 2024 through 2028.

Defined Contribution Retirement Plans
The Company offers participation in the INTL FCStone Inc. 401(k) 
Plan (“401(k) Plan”), a defined contribution plan providing retirement 
benefits to all domestic full-time non-temporary employees who have 
reached 21 years of age. Employees may contribute from 1% to 80% of 
their annual compensation to the 401(k) Plan, limited to a maximum 
annual amount as set periodically by the Internal Revenue Service. The 
Company makes matching contributions to the 401(k) Plan in an 
amount equal to 62.5% of each participant’s eligible elective deferral 
contribution to the 401(k) Plan, up to 8% of employee compensation. 
Matching contributions vest, by participant, based on the following 
years of service schedule: less than two years – none, after two years – 
33%, after three years – 66%, and after four years – 100%.
U.K. based employees of INTL FCStone are eligible to participate 
in a defined contribution pension plan. The Company contributes 
double the employee’s contribution up to 10% of total base salary 
for this plan. For this plan, employees are 100% vested in both the 
employee and employer contributions at all times.
For fiscal years ended September 30, 2018, 2017, and 2016, the 
Company’s contribution to these defined contribution plans were 
$6.8 million, $6.1 million and $5.3 million, respectively.

NOTE 17  Bad Debt on Physical Coal

During the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 
2017, the Company recorded charges to earnings of $1.0 million and 
$47.0 million, respectively, to record an allowance for doubtful accounts 
related to a bad debt incurred in the physical coal business, conducted 
solely in the Company’s Singapore subsidiary, INTL Asia Pte. Ltd., 
with a coal supplier. Components of the bad debt on physical coal 
include allowances on amounts due to the Company from the supplier 
related to: coal paid for but not delivered to clients; reimbursement 
of demurrage claims, dead freight and other charges paid by INTL 
Asia Pte. Ltd. to its clients; reimbursement due for deficiencies in 
the quality of coal delivered to clients; and losses incurred related to 
the cancellation of open sales contracts.
During fiscal 2017, the Company purchased coal delivered onto 
barges and paid 80% of the value against bills of lading and purchase 
invoices, with the remaining 20% payable following inspection upon 
delivery to clients’ vessels. The Company took title of the coal when 
it was loaded onto barges and maintained title until it was offloaded 
onto clients’ vessels. The logistics related to the delivery of coal to the 
clients’ vessels was out-sourced to the Company’s coal supplier, and the 
Company determined that certain purchased coal was not delivered 
to the clients’ vessels during the fourth quarter ended September 30, 
2017. Furthermore, the Company determined that the supplier was 

NOTE 18  Income Taxes

unable to deliver such purchased coal to its clients. Demurrage claims, 
dead freight, and other penalty charges paid and payable by INTL 
Asia Pte. Ltd. to its clients were due to be reimbursed by the supplier 
based on transaction agreements with the supplier. The Company 
determined the supplier was unable to make this reimbursement.
The Company received an acknowledgment of debt and a note from 
the supplier, however, there is substantial uncertainty as to whether the 
supplier will be able to meet its financial obligations to the Company 
and as to the timing of any recovery. The Company continues to pursue 
all legal avenues available to it regarding this matter. The bad debt 
on physical coal is presented separately as a component of income 
before tax in the consolidated income statements. The Company 
has completed its exit of the physical coal business, which was part 
of our Physical Commodities segment and was conducted solely in 
INTL Asia Pte. Ltd.
On November 22, 2018, the Company reached a settlement with a 
client, paying $5.1 million related to demurrage, dead freight, and 
other penalty charges regarding coal supplied during fiscal 2017. 
The settlement amount paid was less than the accrued liability for 
the transactions recorded during fiscal 2017, and accordingly the 
Company will record a recovery on the bad debt on physical coal of 
$1.7 million in the three months ending December 31, 2018.

Effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
On December 22, 2017, the President of the United States (“U.S.”) 
signed and enacted into law H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the 
“Tax Reform”). Among the significant changes to the U.S. Internal 
Revenue Code, the Tax Reform lowers the U.S. federal corporate 
income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. The 
Company computed income tax expense for the year ended September 
30, 2018 using a U.S. statutory tax rate of 24.5%. The 21% U.S. 
statutory tax rate will apply to fiscal years ending September 30, 2019 

and thereafter. The Tax Reform also imposes a one-time mandatory 
repatriation transition tax on previously untaxed accumulated and 
current earnings and profits (“E&P”) of certain foreign subsidiaries.
The SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”), 
which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the Tax 
Reform. SAB 118 provides a measurement period that should not 
extend beyond one year from the Tax Reform enactment date for 
companies to complete the accounting under Accounting Standards 
Codification (“ASC”) 740 - Income Taxes (“ASC 740”). In accordance 

93

                                  - Form 10-Kpart II 
ITEM 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

with SAB 118, a company must reflect the income tax effects of 
those aspects of the Tax Reform for which the accounting under 
ASC 740 is complete. To the extent that a company’s accounting 
for certain income tax effects of the Tax Reform is incomplete but 
it can determine a reasonable estimate, it must record a provisional 
estimate in the financial statements. If a company cannot determine 
a provisional estimate to be included in the financial statements, it 
should continue to apply ASC 740 based on the tax laws that were in 
effect immediately before the enactment of the Tax Reform.
The accounting for certain elements of the Tax Reform is incomplete. 
However, as of September 30, 2018, the accounting for the 
remeasurement of the deferred tax assets and liabilities is complete. 
The remeasurement of the deferred tax assets and liabilities resulted 
in $8.6 million of income tax expense, which increased the effective 
tax rate by 8.5% during the year ended September 30, 2018.
To determine the amount of the mandatory repatriation transition 
tax, the Company must determine, in addition to other factors, the 
amount of post 1986 E&P of the relevant subsidiaries, as well as the 
amount of non-U.S. income taxes paid on such earnings. The Company 
made a reasonable estimate of the mandatory repatriation transition tax 

and recorded a provisional transition tax obligation of $11.2 million, 
which increased the effective tax rate by 11% during the year ended 
September 30, 2018. While the Company can make reasonable estimates 
for the deemed repatriation transition tax, the final tax impact may 
differ from these estimates, due to, among other things, changes in 
our interpretations and assumptions, additional guidance that may 
be issued by taxing authorities, and actions the Company may take.
The Tax Reform also establishes new tax laws that will affect the fiscal year 
ending September 30, 2019, including, but not limited to, (1) elimination 
of the corporate alternative minimum tax, (2) a new provision designed 
to tax global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI), (3) limitations on 
the utilization of net operating losses incurred in tax years beginning 
after September 30, 2018 to 80% of taxable income per tax year, (4) the 
creation of the base erosion anti-abuse tax (BEAT), (5) a general elimination 
of U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries, 
and (6) limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and certain 
executive compensation. The Company has not yet determined the 
potential tax impact of provisions that are not yet effective, such as 
GILTI, BEAT, and the elimination of U.S. tax on dividends of future 
foreign earnings. The Company expects to make the policy election to 
treat GILTI as a period expense in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019.

Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences 
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax 
bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when 
taxes are actually paid or recovered.
As of September 30, 2018 and 2017, the Company has net operating 
loss carryforwards for U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign income tax 
purposes of $9.4 million and $30.1 million, net of valuation allowances, 
respectively, which are available to offset future taxable income in 
these jurisdictions. The Company utilized the $21.9 million U.S. 
federal net operating loss in the current year against the mandatory 
repatriation transition tax. The state and local net operating loss 
carryforwards of $5.7 million, net of valuation allowance, begin to 
expire after September 2020. INTL Asia Pte. Ltd. has a net operating 
loss carryforward of $2.9 million. This Singapore net operating loss has 

an indefinite carryforward and, in the judgment of management, is 
more likely than not to be realized. As a result of Tax Reform, the AMT 
credit carryforward deferred tax asset has been reclassified to income 
taxes receivable. The Company can continue to utilize AMT credits 
to offset regular income tax liability in fiscal years 2019 through 2021. 
Any remaining amount is fully refundable by fiscal year 2022. In the 
current year, the Company generated $6.5 million in foreign tax credit 
carryforwards as part of the mandatory repatriation transition tax. These 
credits expire in fiscal year 2028. In the judgment of management, 
the Company believes that sufficient taxable income will be earned to 
utilize the foreign tax credit carryforwards within 10 years.
The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of September 30, 
2018 was $3.5 million. The net change in the total valuation allowance 
for the year ended September 30, 2018 was a decrease of $0.5 million. 

95

                                  - Form 10-Kpart II 
ITEM 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

The valuation allowances as of September 30, 2018 and 2017 were 
primarily related to U.S. state and local and foreign net operating loss 
carryforwards that, in the judgment of management, are not more 
likely than not to be realized.
The Company incurred U.S. federal, state, and local taxable losses for 
the years ended September 30, 2018 (excluding the taxable income 
associated with the mandatory repatriation transition tax), 2017, 
and 2016 of $(3.7) million, $(20.5) million, and $(9.7) million, 
respectively. The differences between actual levels of past taxable 
losses and pre-tax book income (losses) are primarily attributable to 
temporary differences in these jurisdictions, such as tax deductible 
amortization and bonus depreciation. When evaluating if U.S. federal, 
state, and local deferred taxes are realizable, the Company considered 
deferred tax liabilities of $5.0 million that are scheduled to reverse from 
2019 to 2021 and $2.5 million of deferred tax liabilities associated 
with unrealized gains in securities which the Company could sell, 
if necessary. Furthermore, the Company considered its ability to 
implement business and tax planning strategies that would allow 
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

the remaining U.S. federal, state, and local deferred tax assets, net 
of valuation allowances, to be realized in less than 5 years. Based on 
the tax planning strategies that can be implemented, management 
believes that it is more likely than not that the Company will realize 
the tax benefit of the deferred tax assets, net of the existing valuation 
allowance, in the future.
The total amount of undistributed earnings in the Company’s 
foreign subsidiaries, for income tax purposes, was $354.7 million 
as of September 30, 2018. The Company recognized the mandatory 
repatriation tax related to these undistributed earnings as part of Tax 
Reform and, as a result, repatriation of these amounts would not be 
subject to additional U.S. federal income tax but may be subject 
to applicable withholding taxes in the relevant jurisdictions. The 
Company’s intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside 
of the United States, with the exception of $13.0 million that will 
be distributed in fiscal year 2019. Foreign withholding tax is not 
applicable to this distribution.

The Company has a minimal balance of unrecognized tax benefits as 
of September 30, 2018, that, if recognized, would affect the effective 
tax rate. While it is expected that the amount of unrecognized tax 
benefits will change in the next twelve months, the Company does 
not expect this change to have a material impact on the results of 
operations or the financial position of the Company.
Accrued interest and penalties are included in the related tax liability 
line in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company had no accrued 
interest and penalties included in the consolidated balance sheets as 
of September 30, 2018 and 2017.
The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to 
income taxes as a component of income tax expense. The Company 
had no amount of interest, net of federal benefit, and penalties

open tax years ending September 30, 2017 to September 30, 2018. In 
Brazil, the Company has open tax years ranging from December 31,

local currency, cross-border payments to the developing world. The 
purchase price was approximately $3.8 million of cash consideration. 
The purchase price allocation resulted in $0.7 million in receivables, 
$0.8 million in property, plant, and equipment, $0.5 million in equity 
investments, and $2.2 million in liabilities assumed. Additionally, the 
Company acquired identifiable, definite lived client relationship and 
client list assets that have been assigned a fair value of $1.3 million and 
a useful life of 5 years. The fair value of the consideration transferred 
exceeded the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed. The excess of the purchase consideration over the fair 
value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired of 
$2.6 million was recorded as goodwill. Management believes that 
the goodwill represents the synergies expected from the incremental 
revenue that can be realized from combining the technologies acquired 
with the Company’s pre-existing correspondent banking network. 

                                 - Form 10-KThe estimated fair value assigned to the tangible assets, identifiable 
intangible assets, and assumed liabilities were based on management’s 
estimates and assumptions.
This business has been included within the Company’s Global 
Payments Segment. The Company’s consolidated income statement 
for the year ended September 30, 2018 includes the post-acquisition 
results of ITS, which was immaterial in relation to the Company’s 
consolidated results.

Carl Kliem S.A.
On June 12, 2018, the Company executed a sale and purchase agreement 
to acquire the entire issued and outstanding share capital of Carl 
Kliem S.A. Carl Kliem S.A. is an independent interdealer broker based 
in Luxembourg, a leading European financial hub, which provides 
foreign exchange, interest rate and fixed income products to a diverse, 
institutional client base across the European Union. Carl Kliem S.A. 
employs approximately 40 people and has over 400 active institutional 
clients. This acquisition is expected to provide the Company with a 
strong European client base and a European Union based footprint 
following the completion of Brexit. The closing of the agreement 
was conditional upon approval of the Luxembourg financial sector 
supervisory authority, the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur 
Financier (“CSSF”). In November 2018, the Company received 
regulatory approval from the CSSF to complete the acquisition and 
the acquisition closed effective November 30, 2018. The purchase 
price is equal to the net tangible book value on the closing date minus 
restructuring costs and is not material to the Company. The initial 
accounting for the purchase price allocation is not yet complete.

Acquisition in Fiscal 2017

ICAP’s EMEA Oils Broking Business
Effective October 1, 2016, the Company’s subsidiary, INTL FCStone 
Ltd acquired the London-based EMEA oils business of ICAP Plc. 
The business included more than 30 front office employees across 
the fuel, crude, middle distillates, futures and options desks that have 
relationships with more than 200 commercial and institutional clients 
throughout Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The terms of the 
agreement included cash consideration of $6.0 million paid directly to 
ICAP as well as incentive amounts payable to employees acquired based 
upon their continued employment. The cash consideration paid to 
ICAP was dependent upon the number of brokers who accepted INTL 
FCStone Ltd’s employment offer. The transaction was accounted for 
as an asset acquisition in accordance with FASB ASC 805-50 and 
FASB ASC 350. The cash consideration paid was allocated entirely to 
the intangible asset recognized related to the client base acquired. The 
intangible asset was assigned to the Clearing and Execution Services 
segment and will be amortized over a useful life of 5 years.

Acquisition in Fiscal 2016

Sterne Agee
Effective July 1, 2016, the Company acquired all of the equity 
interests of Sterne Agee, LLC’s (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Stifel 
Financial Corp.) legacy independent brokerage and clearing businesses, 
Sterne Agee & Leach, Inc.; Sterne Agee Clearing, Inc.; Sterne Agee 
Financial Services, Inc. Effective August 1, 2016, the Company 
acquired all of the equity interests of Sterne Agee, LLC’s legacy 
Registered Investment Advisor (“RIA”) business, Sterne Agee Asset 
Management, Inc. and Sterne Agee Investment Advisor Services, Inc. 
- collectively (“Sterne Agee”) for cash consideration. Effective July 1, 
2017, Sterne Agee & Leach, Inc. was merged into the Company’s 
wholly-owned regulated U.S. subsidiary, INTL FCStone Financial. 
Additionally, during 2017, Sterne Agee Clearing, Inc., Sterne Agee 
Financial Services, Inc., Sterne Agee Asset Management, Inc., and 
Sterne Agee Investment Advisor Services, Inc. were renamed INTL 
Custody & Clearing Solutions, Inc., SA Stone Wealth Management, 
Inc., INTL Advisory Consultants, Inc., and SA Stone Investment 
Advisors, Inc., respectively.
The acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred 
totaled $45.0 million. The purchase price allocation resulted in 
$24.9 million in cash, $151.6 million in receivables, $5.7 million in 
deferred tax assets, $4.8 million in other assets and $136.0 million 
in liabilities assumed. The fair value of identifiable assets acquired 
and liabilities assumed exceeded the fair value of the consideration 
transferred. Consequently, the Company reassessed the recognition 
and measurement of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
and concluded that all acquired assets and assumed liabilities were 
recognized and that the valuation procedures and resulting measures 
were appropriate. As a result, the Company recognized a gain of 
$6.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2016, which is included 
in the line item ‘Other gains’ in the consolidated income statement. 
The Company believes the transaction resulted in a gain primarily 
due to the Company’s ability to incorporate these business activities 
into its existing business structure, and its ability to utilize certain 
deferred tax assets and other assets while operating the business that 
may not have been likely to be realized by the seller. There were no 
purchase price adjustments recorded during the measurement period 
and the purchase price allocation is now considered final.
The businesses have been included within the Company’s Clearing 
and Execution Services Segment. The Company’s consolidated 
income statement for the year ended September 30, 2016 includes 
the post-acquisition results of the Sterne Agee businesses, which were 
immaterial. The acquired businesses contributed net operating revenues 
of $8.6 million and net loss of $0.1 million to the Company for the 
period from July 1, 2016 to September 30, 2016.

The Company reports its operating segments based on services provided 
to clients. The Company’s business activities are managed as operating 
segments and organized into reportable segments as follows:
•• Commercial Hedging (includes components Financial Agricultural 
(Ag) & Energy and LME Metals)
•• Global Payments
•• Securities (includes components Equity Capital Markets (formerly 
referred to as Equity Market-Making), Debt Capital Markets 
(which now includes both our Debt Trading and Investment Banking 
businesses discussed in prior fiscal years) and Asset Management)
•• Physical Commodities (includes components Precious Metals and 
Physical Ag & Energy)
•• Clearing and Execution Services (includes components Exchange-Traded 
Futures and Options, FX Prime Brokerage, Correspondent Clearing, 
Independent Wealth Management, and Derivative Voice Brokerage)

Commercial Hedging
The Company serves its commercial clients through its team of risk 
management consultants, providing a high-value-added service that it 
believes differentiates the Company from its competitors and maximizes 
the opportunity to retain clients. The Company’s risk management 
consulting services are designed to quantify and monitor commercial 
entities’ exposure to commodity and financial risk. Upon assessing this 
exposure, the Company develops a plan to control and hedge these 
risks with post-trade reporting against specific client objectives. Clients 
are assisted in the execution of their hedging strategies through a wide 
range of products from listed exchange-traded futures and options, 
to basic OTC instruments that offer greater flexibility, to structured 
OTC products designed for customized solutions.
The Company’s services span virtually all traded commodity markets, 
with the largest concentrations in agricultural and energy commodities 
(consisting primarily of grains, energy and renewable fuels, coffee, 
sugar, cotton, and food service) and base metals products listed on the 
LME. The Company’s base metals business includes a position as a 
Category One ring dealing member of the LME, providing execution, 
clearing and advisory services in exchange-traded futures and OTC 
products. The Company also provides execution of foreign currency 
forwards and options and interest rate swaps as well as a wide range 
of structured product solutions to commercial clients who are seeking 
cost-effective hedging strategies. Generally, clients direct their own 
trading activity and the Company’s risk management consultants do 
not have discretionary authority to transact trades on behalf of clients.

Global Payments
The Company provides global payment solutions to banks and 
commercial businesses as well as charities and non-governmental 
organizations and government organizations. The Company offers 
payments services in more than 170 countries and 140 currencies, 
which it believes is more than any other payments solution provider, 
and provides competitive and transparent pricing. Its proprietary 
FXecute global payments platform is integrated with a financial 
information exchange (“FIX”) protocol. This FIX protocol is an 
electronic communication method for the real-time exchange of 
information, and the Company believes it represents one of the first 
FIX offerings for cross-border payments in exotic currencies. FIX 
functionality allows clients to view real time market rates for various 
currencies, execute and manage orders in real-time, and view the 
status of their payments through the easy-to-use portal.
Additionally, as a member of the Society for Worldwide Interbank 
Financial Telecommunication (“SWIFT”), the Company is able to 
offer its services to large money center and global banks seeking more 
competitive international payments services.
Through this single comprehensive platform and our commitment to 
client service, the Company believes it is able to provide simple and fast 
execution, ensuring delivery of funds in any of these countries quickly 
through its global network of approximately 300 correspondent banks. 
In this business, the Company primarily acts as a principal in buying 
and selling foreign currencies on a spot basis. The Company derives 
revenue from the difference between the purchase and sale prices.
The Company believes its clients value its ability to provide exchange 
rates that are significantly more competitive than those offered by large 
international banks, a competitive advantage that stems from its years 
of foreign exchange expertise focused on smaller, less liquid currencies.

Securities
The Company provides value-added solutions that facilitate 
cross-border trading and believes its clients value the Company’s 
ability to manage complex transactions, including foreign exchange, 
utilizing its local understanding of market convention, liquidity and 
settlement protocols around the world. The Company’s clients include 
U.S.-based regional and national broker-dealers and institutions 
investing or executing client transactions in international markets and 
foreign institutions seeking access to the U.S. securities markets. The 
Company is one of the leading market makers in foreign securities, 
including unlisted ADRs, GDRs and foreign ordinary shares. The 

98

                                 - Form 10-KCompany makes markets in over 5,000 ADRs, GDRs and foreign 
ordinary shares, of which over 3,600 trade in the OTC market. 
In addition, it will, on request, make prices in more than 10,000 
unlisted foreign securities. The Company is also a broker-dealer in 
Argentina where we are active in providing institutional executions 
in the local capital markets.
The Company acts as an institutional dealer in fixed income securities, 
including U.S. Treasury, U.S. government agency, agency mortgage-
backed and asset-backed securities to a client base including asset 
managers, commercial bank trust and investment departments, 
broker-dealers and insurance companies.
The Company also originates, structures and places debt instruments 
in the international and domestic capital markets. These instruments 
include complex asset-backed securities (primarily in Argentina) and 
domestic municipal securities. On occasion, the Company may invest 
its own capital in debt instruments before selling them. The Company 
also actively trades in a variety of international debt instruments 
and operates an asset management business in which it earns fees, 
commissions and other revenues for management of third party 
assets and investment gains or losses on its investments in funds and 
proprietary accounts managed either by its investment managers or 
by independent investment managers.

Physical Commodities
This segment consists of the Company’s physical Precious Metals 
trading and Physical Agricultural and Energy commodity businesses. 
In Precious Metals, the Company provides a full range of trading and 
hedging capabilities, including OTC products, to select producers, 
consumers, and investors. In the Company’s trading activities, it acts 
as a principal, committing its own capital to buy and sell precious 
metals on a spot and forward basis.
In the Company’s Physical Ag & Energy commodity business, it acts 
as a principal to facilitate financing, structured pricing and logistics 
services to clients across the commodity complex, including energy 
commodities, grains, oil seeds, cotton, coffee, cocoa, edible oils and feed 
products. The Company provides financing to commercial commodity-
related companies against physical inventories. The Company uses sale 
and repurchase agreements to purchase commodities evidenced by 
warehouse receipts, subject to a simultaneous agreement to sell such 
commodities back to the original seller at a later date.
Transactions where the sale and repurchase price are fixed upon 
execution, and meet additional required conditions, are accounted for 
as product financing arrangements, and accordingly no commodity 
inventory, purchases or sales are recorded. Transactions where the 
repurchase price is not fixed at execution do not meet all the criteria 
to be accounted for as product financing arrangements, and therefore 
are recorded as commodity inventory, purchases and sales.
INTL FCStone Ltd precious metals sales and cost of sales are presented 
on a net basis and included as a component of ‘trading gains, net’ in 
the consolidated income statements, in accordance with U.S GAAP 
accounting requirements for broker-dealers. Precious metals sales and 
cost of sales for subsidiaries that are not broker-dealers continue to be 
recorded on a gross basis.
Precious metals inventory held by subsidiaries that are not broker-dealers 
continues to be valued at the lower of cost or market value. Precious

metals sales and cost of sales for subsidiaries that are not broker-dealers 
continue to be recorded on a gross basis. The agricultural commodity 
inventories are carried at net realizable value, which approximates fair 
value less disposal costs. The agricultural inventories have reliable, readily 
determinable and realizable market prices, have relatively insignificant 
costs of disposal and are available for immediate delivery. The Company 
records its Physical Ag & Energy commodities revenues on a gross basis.
Operating revenues and losses from its precious metals commodities 
derivatives activities are included in ‘trading gains, net’ in the consolidated 
income statements. Operating revenues and losses from our Physical Ag 
and Energy commodity business are included in ‘cost of sales of physical 
commodities’ in the consolidated income statements The Company 
generally mitigates the price risk associated with commodities held 
in inventory through the use of derivatives. The Company does not 
elect hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP in accounting for this price 
risk mitigation. The Company’s management continues to evaluate 
performance and allocated resources on an operating revenue basis.

Clearing and Execution Services (CES)
The Company provides competitive and efficient clearing and execution 
in all major futures and securities exchanges globally as well as prime 
brokerage in major foreign currency pairs and swap transactions. 
Through its platform, client orders are accepted and directed to the 
appropriate exchange for execution. The Company then facilitates 
the clearing of clients’ transactions. Clearing involves the matching of 
clients’ trades with the exchange, the collection and management of 
client margin deposits to support the transactions, and the accounting 
and reporting of the transactions to clients.
As of September 30, 2018, the Company held $2.6 billion in required 
client segregated assets, which it believes makes it the third largest 
independent futures commission merchant (“FCM”) in the U.S. not 
affiliated with a major financial institution or commodity intermediary, 
end-user or producer, as measured by required client segregated assets. 
The Company seeks to leverage its capabilities and capacity by offering 
facilities management or outsourcing solutions to other FCM’s.
The Company is an independent full-service provider to introducing 
broker-dealers (“IBD’s”) of clearing, custody, research, syndicated and 
security-based lending products and services, including a proprietary 
technology platform which offers seamless connectivity to ensure a 
positive client experience through the clearing and settlement process. 
The Company’s independent wealth management business, which 
offers a comprehensive product suite to retail clients nationwide, clears 
through this platform. The Company believes it is one of the leading 
mid-market clearer’s in the securities industry, with approximately 60 
correspondent clearing relationships with over $15 billion in assets 
under management or administration as of September 30, 2018.
Within this segment, the Company also maintains what it believes 
is one of the largest non-bank prime brokers and swap dealers in 
the world. Through this offering, the Company provides prime 
brokerage foreign exchange (“FX”) services to financial institutions 
and professional traders. The Company provides its clients with the 
full range of OTC products, including 24-hour a day execution of 
spot, forwards and options as well as non-deliverable forwards in both 
liquid and exotic currencies. The Company also operate a proprietary 
foreign exchange desk that arbitrages the exchange-traded foreign 
exchange markets with the cash markets.

Through its London-based Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) 
oil voice brokerage business, the Company employs over 30 employees 
providing brokerage services across the fuel, crude and middle distillates 
markets with over 200 well known commercial and institutional clients 
throughout Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

********

The total revenues reported combine gross revenues for the physical 
commodities business and net revenues for all other businesses. In 
order to reflect the way that the Company’s management views the 
results, the tables below also reflect the segment contribution to 
‘operating revenues’, which is shown on the face of the consolidated 
income statements and which is calculated by deducting physical 
commodities cost of sales from total revenues.
Segment data includes the profitability measure of net contribution by 
segment. Net contribution is one of the key measures used by management 
to assess the performance of each segment and for decisions regarding 
the allocation of the Company’s resources. Net contribution is calculated 
as revenue less direct cost of sales, transaction-based clearing expenses, 
variable compensation, introducing broker commissions, and interest 
expense. Variable compensation paid to risk management consultants/

traders generally represents a fixed percentage of an amount equal to 
revenues generated, and in some cases, revenues produced less transaction-
based clearing charges, base salaries and an overhead allocation.
Segment data also includes segment income which is calculated as 
net contribution less non-variable direct expenses of the segment. 
These non-variable direct expenses include trader base compensation 
and benefits, operational employee compensation and benefits, 
communication and data services, business development, professional 
fees, bad debts and other direct expenses.
Inter-segment revenues, charges, receivables and payables are eliminated 
upon consolidation, except revenues and costs related to foreign currency 
transactions undertaken on an arm’s length basis by the foreign exchange 
trading business for the securities business. The foreign exchange trading 
business competes for this business as it does for any other business. If 
its rates are not competitive, the securities businesses buy or sell their 
foreign currency through other market counterparties.
On a recurring basis, the Company sweeps excess cash from certain 
operating segments to a centralized corporate treasury function in 
exchange for an intercompany receivable asset. The intercompany 
receivable asset is eliminated during consolidation, and therefore this 
practice may impact reported total assets between segments.

Information concerning operations in these segments of business is shown in accordance with the Segment Reporting Topic of the ASC as follows:

During the week ended November 16, 2018, balances in approximately 
300 accounts of the FCM division of the Company’s wholly owned 
subsidiary, INTL FCStone Financial, declined below required 
maintenance margin levels, primarily as a result of significant price 
fluctuations in the natural gas markets. All positions in these accounts, 
which were managed by OptionSellers.com Inc. (“OptionSellers”), an 
independent Commodity Trading Advisor (“CTA”), were liquidated in 
accordance with the INTL FCStone Financial’s customer agreements 
and obligations under market regulation standards.
A CTA is by definition registered with the CFTC and a member of, 
and subject to audit by, the NFA. OptionSellers is registered under 
a CFTC Rule 4.7 exemption for “qualified eligible persons”, which 
requires the account holders authorizing OptionSellers to act as their 
CTA to meet or exceed certain minimum financial requirements. 
OptionSellers, in its role as a CTA, had been granted by each of 
its customers full discretionary authority to manage the trading in 
the customer accounts, while INTL FCStone Financial acted solely 
as the clearing firm in its role as the FCM, at all times meeting its 
obligations as the FCM to these accounts.
INTL FCStone Financial’s customer agreements conform to NFA 
guidance, disclose the risks to which account-holders are exposed, 
hold account-holders liable for all losses in their accounts, and 

part II 
ITEM 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

obligate the account holders to reimburse INTL FCStone Financial 
for any account deficits in their accounts. INTL FCStone Financial 
continues to pursue collection of these receivables in the ordinary 
course of business. INTL FCStone Financial intends both to enforce 
and to defend its rights aggressively, and to claim interest and costs 
of collection where applicable. INTL FCStone Financial’s standard 
customer agreements provide for arbitration of disputes between parties.
As of December 10, 2018, the aggregate receivable from these customer 
accounts, net of collections and other allowable deductions thus far, 
is $31.3 million, with no individual account receivable exceeding 
$1.4 million. The exposure to losses from these customer accounts is 
not yet determinable, as collection efforts are in early stages, given the 
timing of events that lead to the receivable balances disclosed above. 
Depending on future collections and an assessment to be made under 
U.S. GAAP, any provisions for bad debts and actual losses ultimately 
may or may not be material to the Company’s financial results. The 
Company believes that these accounts receivable balances, along with 
possible exposure to losses from these customer accounts, will not 
impact the Company’s ability to comply with its ongoing liquidity, 
capital, and regulatory requirements.

ITEM 9A Controls and Procedures

(a) 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

In connection with the filing of this Form 10-K, our management, 
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, 
evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure 
controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) 
and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended 
(the “Exchange Act”)) as of September 30, 2018. We seek to design 
our disclosure controls and procedures to provide reasonable assurance 
that the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act contain 
the required information and that we submit these reports within 

the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. We also seek to 
design these controls and procedures to ensure that we accumulate and 
communicate correct information to our management, including our 
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, 
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief 
Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and 
procedures were effective as of September 30, 2018.

(b)  Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining 
adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is 
defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Our internal 
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide 
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting 
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes 
in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles 
(“U.S. GAAP”). Our internal control over financial reporting includes 
those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance 
of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the 
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide 
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary 
to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with 
U.S. GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are 
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management 
and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance 
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, 
use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material 
effect on the financial statements.
There are limitations inherent in any internal control, such as the 
possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding 
of controls. A control system, no matter how well conceived and 
operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that 
the objectives of the control system are met, and may not prevent or 
detect misstatements. As conditions change over time, so too may the 

effectiveness of internal controls. A material weakness is a deficiency, 
or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial 
reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material 
misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not 
be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
Management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer 
and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the Company’s internal control 
over financial reporting as of September 30, 2018, based on the 
framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) 
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of 
the Treadway Commission.
Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal 
control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2018 excluded 
PayCommerce Financial Solutions, LLC, acquired with effect from 
September 5, 2018.
Based on its assessment, management has concluded that our internal 
control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2018.
KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, was 
engaged to audit the effectiveness of our internal control over financial 
reporting as of September 30, 2018 and has issued an audit report 
regarding their assessment of the effectiveness of internal control 
over financial reporting which is included on page 65 in this Annual 
Report on Form 10-K.

4.  The registrant’s other certifying officer and I are responsible for 
establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures

internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange 
Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d - 15(f)) for the registrant and have:
(a)  Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused 
such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under 
our supervision, to ensure that material information relating 
to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is 
made known to us by others within those entities, particularly 
during the period in which this report is being prepared;
(b)  Designed such internal control over financial reporting, 
or caused such internal control over financial reporting to

principles;

(c)  Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant’s disclosure

(d)  Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant’s internal 
control over financial reporting that occurred during the 
registrant’s most recent fiscal quarter that has materially 
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the 
registrant’s internal control over financial reporting; and

5.  The registrant’s other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based 
on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial 
reporting, to the registrant’s auditors and the audit committee 
of the registrant’s board of directors (or persons performing the 
equivalent functions):
(a)  All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in 
the design or operation of internal control over financial 
reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect 
the registrant’s ability to record, process, summarize and 
report financial information; and 

(b)  Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management 
or other employees who have a significant role in the 
registrant’s internal control over financial reporting.
