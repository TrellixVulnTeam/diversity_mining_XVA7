Dear Fellow Stockholders:

I am proud to present WestRock’s annual report for ﬁscal 2017.  We accomplished 
a great deal in ﬁscal 2017, and our future is bright. As I write this, we have just 
completed our ﬁrst Investor Day during which we articulated our differentiated 
strategy and our expectations for the next several years.   

We ﬁnd ourselves at an opportune time in our growing industry. Paper and 
packaging use renewable and recycled resources to provide sustainable solutions 
that protect and promote our customers’ products. We provide extraordinary value 
to our customers by providing solutions that help our customers grow their sales  
and reduce their costs. Scale and differentiation matter in the paper and packaging  
industry; we are building WestRock into a leading paper and packaging company  
with the scale, differentiated strategy and capabilities to generate attractive returns  
for our stockholders over the long term. 

Fiscal 2017 Highlights

Steve Voorhees
Chief Executive Officer

We achieved solid ﬁnancial results in ﬁscal 2017. Our net sales were $15 billion and our adjusted segment EBITDA 
was $2.3 billion.* We generated $2.0 billion of adjusted operating cash ﬂow and exceeded our target of $1.2 billion of 
adjusted free cash ﬂow during the year.* And, we returned nearly $500 million to our stockholders through dividends 
and share repurchases.

We made substantial progress toward delivering on our $1 billion synergy and performance improvement goal; at ﬁscal 
year end, we had achieved $840 million on an annual run rate basis and expect to achieve the $1 billion target by the end 
of the third quarter of ﬁscal 2018.

We transformed our portfolio to improve our focus on and to expand our paper and packaging businesses during ﬁscal 
2017. These actions included: 

•  The divestiture of our Home, Health and Beauty business for approximately $1.025 billion in cash. The divestiture of 

this business helped align our portfolio and resources around our core paper and packaging solutions businesses.

•  The acquisition of Multi Packaging Solutions International Ltd., a recognized leading global provider of print-based 
specialty packaging solutions, for a total enterprise value of $2.28 billion. This transaction extended our geographic 
reach.

•  Four acquisitions of packaging businesses totaling $372 million that improved our North American corrugated 
packaging footprint  while increasing our integration from 69% to 75%, and provided increased capabilities and 
geographic reach for our folding carton business. 

We want to be the premier partner and unrivaled provider of winning solutions to our customers. We accomplished a 
great deal during ﬁscal 2017 in this regard by earning four supplier of the year awards from our customers, 13 awards 
from the Paperboard Packaging Council and 18 Design of the Times Awards for our merchandising displays business.  

Fiscal 2018 Outlook

We have compelling momentum as we enter ﬁscal 2018. We expect our net sales to increase by 10% to $16.3 billion, 
our adjusted operating cash ﬂow to increase by 15% to $2.3 billion and our adjusted segment EBITDA to increase by 
20% to $2.8 billion.* 

We have initiated several strategic investments that will further build WestRock into a leading paper and packaging 
company, including a $410 million investment in a new paper machine at our Florence, South Carolina containerboard 
mill, a net $125 million investment in a new, state of the art box plant in Brazil and a $57 million investment in a new 
curtain coater at our Mahrt mill in Cottonton, Alabama. 

In November, we increased our annual dividend to $1.72; we have increased our annual dividend by 15 percent over 
the past two years. These increases demonstrate the board of directors’ continued conﬁdence in our ability to generate 
increasing earnings and cash ﬂow over the long term. 

Our Future is Bright

I am proud of the progress we have made over the past two and a half years in building WestRock into a leading paper 
and packaging company. We are committed to delivering best-in-class, differentiated solutions that help our customers 
win in the marketplace. WestRock has the strategy, capabilities and team in place to generate attractive returns over the 
long term and create outstanding value for our customers, stockholders and employees.

We expect to build upon our success by generating more than $5 billion of capital through 2022 to invest back into our 
business to improve our margins, build scale and grow our portfolio of differentiated paper and packaging solutions. 
WestRock has the opportunity to increase adjusted segment EBITDA to more than $4 billion in ﬁscal 2022.* 

With our 45,000 employees’ commitment to delivering outstanding products and excellent service to our customers,  
I am conﬁdent of our ability to create long-term value for our customers, stockholders and employees.  On behalf of the 
board of directors and all of us working together at WestRock, thank you for your investment in us.   

Sincerely,

Steve Voorhees 
Chief Executive Officer 
WestRock Company

Item 1. 

BUSINESS

PART I

Unless the context otherwise requires, “we”, “us”, “our”, “WestRock” and “the Company” refer to the business of WestRock 

Company, its wholly-owned subsidiaries and its partially-owned consolidated subsidiaries. 

General

WestRock is a multinational provider of paper and packaging solutions for consumer and corrugated packaging markets. We 
partner with our customers to provide differentiated paper and packaging solutions that help them win in the marketplace. Our 
team members support customers around the world from our operating and business locations in North America, South America, 
Europe, Asia and Australia. We also sell real estate primarily in the Charleston, SC region. 

WestRock was formed on March 6, 2015 for the purpose of effecting the Combination and, prior to the Combination, did not 
conduct any activities other than those incidental to its formation and the matters contemplated by the Business Combination 
Agreement. On July 1, 2015, pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, RockTenn and MWV completed a strategic 
combination of their respective businesses and RockTenn and MWV each became wholly-owned subsidiaries of WestRock. 
RockTenn was the accounting acquirer in the Combination. We believe the Combination combined two industry leaders to create 
a leading global provider of consumer and corrugated packaging solutions. See “Note 6. Merger, Acquisitions and Investment” 
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

On May 15, 2016, WestRock completed the Separation, pursuant to which we disposed of our former Specialty Chemicals 
segment in its entirety and ceased to consolidate its assets, liabilities and results of operations in our consolidated financial 
statements. Accordingly, we have presented the financial position and results of operations of our former Specialty Chemicals 
segment as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. See “Note 
7. Discontinued Operations” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

On April 6, 2017, we completed the HH&B Sale. We used the proceeds from the HH&B Sale in connection with the MPS 
Acquisition. We recorded a pre-tax gain on sale of HH&B of $192.8 million in fiscal 2017. See “Note 8. Assets Held For Sale” 
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

On June 6, 2017, we completed the MPS Acquisition. MPS is a global provider of print-based specialty packaging solutions 
and its differentiated product offering includes premium folding cartons, inserts, labels and rigid packaging. MPS is reported in 
our Consumer Packaging segment. See “Note 6. Merger, Acquisitions and Investment” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements for additional information.

We report our financial results of operations in three reportable segments: Corrugated Packaging, which consists of our 
containerboard mill and corrugated packaging operations, as well as our recycling operations; Consumer Packaging, which consists 
of consumer mills, folding carton, beverage, merchandising displays, home, health and beauty dispensing (prior to the HH&B 
Sale), and partition operations; and Land and Development, which sells real estate primarily in the Charleston, SC region. In fiscal 
2016, we reclassified prior period segment results to align to these segments for all periods presented. Following the Combination 
and until the completion of the Separation, our financial results of operations had a fourth reportable segment, Specialty Chemicals.

Products

Corrugated Packaging Segment

We are one of the largest integrated producers of containerboard measured by tons produced, and one of the largest producers 
of high-graphics preprinted linerboard measured by net sales in North America. We have integrated corrugated operations in North 
America, Brazil and India. We believe we are one of the largest paper recyclers in North America and our recycling operations 
provide substantially all of the recycled fiber to our mills, as well as to third parties. Our Brazil operations own and operate 
forestlands that provide virgin fiber to our Brazilian mill.

We  operate  an  integrated  corrugated  packaging  system  that  manufactures  primarily  containerboard,  corrugated  sheets, 
corrugated packaging and preprinted linerboard for sale to consumer and industrial products manufacturers and corrugated box 
manufacturers. We produce a full range of high-quality corrugated containers designed to protect, ship, store and display products 
made to our customers' merchandising and distribution specifications. We convert corrugated sheets into corrugated products 
ranging from one-color protective cartons to graphically brilliant point-of-purchase packaging. Our corrugated container plants 

7

serve local customers and regional and large national accounts. Corrugated packaging is used to provide protective packaging for 
shipment and distribution of food, paper, health and beauty and other household, consumer, commercial and industrial products. 
Corrugated packaging may also be graphically enhanced for retail sale, particularly in club store locations. We provide customers 
with innovative packaging solutions to promote and sell their products. We provide structural and graphic design, engineering 
services and custom, proprietary and standard automated packaging machines, offering customers turn-key installation, automation, 
line integration and packaging solutions. To make corrugated sheet stock, we feed linerboard and corrugating medium into a 
corrugator that flutes the medium to specified sizes, glues the linerboard and fluted medium together, and slits and cuts the resulting 
corrugated paperboard into sheets to customer specifications. Our containerboard mills and corrugated container operations are 
integrated with the majority of our containerboard production used internally by our corrugated container operations. The balance 
is either used in trade swaps with other manufacturers or sold domestically and internationally. 

Our recycling operations procure recovered paper (also known as recycled fiber) from our converting facilities and from third 
parties, such as factories, warehouses, commercial printers, office complexes, grocery and retail stores, document storage facilities, 
paper converters and other wastepaper collectors. We handle a wide variety of grades of recovered paper, including old corrugated 
containers, office paper, box clippings, newspaper and print shop scraps. We operate recycling facilities that collect, sort, grade, 
and bale recovered paper and, after sorting and baling, we transfer it to our mills for processing, or sell it principally to U.S. 
manufacturers of paperboard or containerboard, as well as manufacturers of tissue, newsprint, roofing products and insulation, 
and to export markets. We also collect small amounts of other products for resale to manufacturers of those products. Our waste 
services business arranges recycling and waste disposal services for its customers. We operate a nationwide fiber marketing and 
brokerage system that serves large regional and national accounts, as well as our recycled paperboard and containerboard mills, 
and sells scrap materials from our converting businesses and mills. Brokerage contracts provide bulk purchasing, often resulting 
in lower prices and cleaner recovered paper. Many of our recycling facilities are located close to our recycled paperboard and 
containerboard mills, ensuring availability of supply with reduced shipping costs.

Sales of corrugated packaging products to external customers accounted for 55.5%, 54.6% and 66.4% of our net sales in fiscal 
2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. See “Note 21. Segment Information” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, as 
well as Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, for additional 
information.

Consumer Packaging Segment

We operate integrated virgin and recycled fiber paperboard mills and consumer packaging converting operations, which 
convert items such as folding and beverage cartons, displays and interior partitions. Our integrated system of virgin and recycled 
mills produces paperboard for our converting operations and third parties. We internally consume or sell to manufacturers of 
folding cartons and other paperboard products our coated natural kraft, bleached paperboard and coated recycled paperboard, and 
internally consume or sell to manufacturers of solid fiber interior packaging, tubes and cores, book covers and other paperboard 
products our specialty recycled paperboard. The mill owned by our Seven Hills joint venture in Lynchburg, VA manufactures 
gypsum paperboard liner for sale to our joint venture partner.

We are one of the largest manufacturers of folding and beverage cartons in North America. We believe we are one of the 
largest manufacturers of temporary promotional point-of-purchase displays in North America measured by net sales and the largest 
manufacturer of solid fiber partitions in North America measured by net sales. Our folding and beverage cartons are used to 
package items such as food, paper, beverages, dairy products, tobacco, confectionery, health and beauty and other household 
consumer, commercial and industrial products primarily for retail sale. Our folding and beverage cartons are also used by our 
customers to attract consumer attention at the point-of-sale. We also manufacture express mail packages for the overnight courier 
industry, provide inserts and labels as well as rigid packaging and other printed packaging products, such as transaction cards (e.g., 
credit, debit, etc.), brochures, product literature, marketing materials (such as booklets, folders, inserts, cover sheets and slipcases) 
and grower tags and plant stakes for the horticultural market. For the global healthcare market, we manufacture secondary packages 
designed to enhance patient adherence for prescription drugs, as well as paperboard packaging for over-the-counter and prescription 
drugs. Our customers generally use our inserts and labels to provide customer product information either inside a secondary 
package (e.g., a folding carton) or affixed to the outside of a primary package (e.g., a bottle). Folding cartons typically protect 
customers’ products during shipment and distribution, and employ graphics to promote them at retail. We manufacture folding 
and  beverage  cartons  from  recycled  and  virgin  paperboard,  laminated  paperboard  and  various  substrates  with  specialty 
characteristics, such as grease masking and microwaveability. We print, coat, die-cut and glue the cartons to customer specifications 
and ship finished cartons to customers for assembling, filling and sealing. We employ a broad range of offset, flexographic, gravure, 
backside printing, coating and finishing technologies, as well as iridescent, holographic, textured and dimensional effects to provide 
differentiated packaging products, and support our customers with new package development, innovation and design services and 
package testing services. We manufacture and sell our solid fiber and corrugated partitions and die-cut paperboard components 

8

principally to glass container manufacturers and producers of beer, food, wine, spirits, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals, and to the 
automotive industry. 

We design, manufacture and, in many cases, pack temporary displays for sale to consumer products companies and retailers. 
These  displays  are  used  as  marketing  tools  to  support  new  product  introductions  and  specific  product  promotions  in  mass 
merchandising stores, supermarkets, convenience stores, home improvement stores and other retail locations. We also design, 
manufacture and, in some cases, pre-assemble permanent displays for the same categories of customers. We make temporary 
displays primarily from corrugated paperboard. Unlike temporary displays, permanent displays are restocked; therefore, they are 
constructed primarily from metal, plastic, wood and other durable materials. We provide contract packing services, such as multi-
product promotional packing and product manipulation, such as multipacks and onpacks. We manufacture and distribute point of 
sale material utilizing litho, screen, and digital printing technologies. We manufacture lithographic laminated packaging for sale 
to our customers that require packaging with high quality graphics and strength characteristics.

Sales of consumer packaging products to external customers accounted for 42.8%, 44.6% and 33.2% of our net sales in fiscal 
2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. See “Note 21. Segment Information” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, as 
well as Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, for additional 
information.

Land and Development Segment

We are responsible for maximizing the value of the various real estate holdings we own that are concentrated in the Charleston, 
SC region, some of which are held through partnerships. We are in the process of accelerating the monetization of these holdings. 
Sales in our Land and Development segment to external customers accounted for 1.7%, 0.8% and 0.4% of our net sales in fiscal 
2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. See “Note 21. Segment Information” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, as 
well as Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, for additional 
information.

Raw Materials

The primary raw materials used by our mill operations are recycled fiber at our recycled paperboard and containerboard mills 
and  virgin  fibers  from  hardwoods  and  softwoods  at  our  virgin  containerboard  and  paperboard  mills.  Certain  of  our  virgin 
containerboard is manufactured with some recycled fiber content. Recycled fiber prices and virgin fiber prices can fluctuate 
significantly. While virgin fiber prices have generally been more stable than recycled fiber prices, they also fluctuate, particularly 
during significant changes in weather, such as during prolonged periods of heavy rain or drought, or during housing construction 
slowdowns or accelerations.

 
Recycled and virgin paperboard and containerboard are the primary raw materials used by our converting operations. Our 
converting operations use many different grades of paperboard and containerboard. We supply substantially all of our converting 
operations' needs for recycled and virgin paperboard and containerboard from our own mills and through the use of trade swaps 
with other manufacturers. These arrangements allow us to optimize our mill system and reduce freight costs. Because there are 
other suppliers that produce the necessary grades of recycled and bleached paperboard and containerboard used in our converting 
operations, we believe we would be able to source significant replacement quantities from other suppliers in the event we incur 
production disruptions for recycled or virgin paperboard or containerboard. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors — We May Face Increased 
Costs or Inadequate Availability of Raw Materials, Energy and Transportation”.

Energy

Energy is one of the most significant costs of our mill operations. The cost of natural gas, coal, oil, electricity and wood by-
products (biomass) can fluctuate significantly. In our recycled paperboard mills, we use primarily natural gas and electricity, 
supplemented with coal and fuel oil to generate steam used in the paper making process and, at a few mills, to generate electricity 
used on site. In our virgin fiber mills, we use biomass, natural gas and coal to generate steam used in the pulping and paper making 
processes and to generate some or all of the electricity used on site. We primarily use electricity and natural gas to operate our 
converting facilities. We generally purchase these products from suppliers at market or tariff rates. See also Item 1. “Business — 
Governmental Regulation — Environmental and Other Matters” for additional information. See also Item 1A. “Risk Factors 
— We May Face Increased Costs or Inadequate Availability of Raw Materials, Energy and Transportation”.

9

Transportation

Inbound and outbound freight is a significant expenditure for us. Factors that influence our freight expense are distance 
between our shipping and delivery locations, distance from customers and suppliers, mode of transportation (rail, truck, intermodal 
and ocean) and freight rates, which are influenced by supply and demand and fuel costs. The principal markets for our products 
are in North America, South America, Europe, Asia and Australia. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors — We May Face Increased Costs 
or Inadequate Availability of Raw Materials, Energy and Transportation”.

Sales and Marketing

Our top 10 external customers represented approximately 11% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2017. None of these 
customers individually accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net sales. We generally manufacture our products pursuant 
to customers’ orders. We believe that we have good relationships with our customers. In fiscal 2017, products sold to our top 10 
customers by segment represented 16% and 18% of our external sales in our Corrugated Packaging segment and Consumer 
Packaging segment, respectively. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors — We Depend on Certain Large Customers”.

As a result of our vertical integration, our mills’ sales volumes may be directly impacted by changes in demand for our 
packaging products. During fiscal 2017, we sold approximately two-thirds of our coated natural kraft production and approximately 
one-fifth of our bleached paperboard production to our converting operations, primarily to manufacture folding and beverage 
cartons, and we sold approximately three-fourths of our containerboard production, including trade swaps and buy/sell transactions, 
to our converting operations to manufacture corrugated products. Under the terms of our Seven Hills joint venture arrangement, 
our joint venture partner is required to purchase all of the qualifying gypsum paperboard liner produced by Seven Hills. Excluding 
the Seven Hills production and our Aurora, IL production converted into book covers and other products, we supplied approximately 
two-fifths of our specialty recycled paperboard production in fiscal 2017 to our converting operations, primarily to manufacture 
interior partitions. We have the ability to move our internal sourcing among certain of our mills to optimize the efficiency of our 
operations.

We market our products primarily through our own sales force. We also market a number of our products through independent 
sales  representatives,  independent  distributors  or  both. We  generally  pay  our  sales  personnel  a  combination  of  base  salary, 
commissions and annual bonus. We pay our independent sales representatives on a commission basis. We discuss foreign net sales 
to  unaffiliated  customers  and  other  non-U.S.  operations  financial  and  other  segment  information  in  “Note  21.  Segment 
Information” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Competition

We operate in a competitive global marketplace and compete with many large, well established and highly competitive 
manufacturers and service providers. Our business is affected by a range of macroeconomic conditions, including industry capacity 
changes, global competition, economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad, as well as fluctuations in currency exchange rates.

The industries we operate in are highly competitive, and no single company dominates any of those industries. Our paperboard 
and containerboard operations compete with integrated and non-integrated national and regional companies operating primarily 
in North America, and to a limited extent, manufacturers outside of North America. Our competitors include large and small, 
vertically integrated companies and numerous smaller non-integrated companies. In the corrugated packaging and folding and 
beverage carton markets, we compete with a significant number of national, regional and local packaging suppliers in North 
America and abroad. In the solid fiber interior packaging, promotional point-of-purchase display and converted paperboard products 
markets, we primarily compete with a smaller number of national, regional and local companies offering highly specialized 
products. Our recycled fiber brokerage and collection operations compete with various other companies for the procurement and 
supply of recovered paper, including brokers and companies that export recovered paper to international markets. The Land and 
Development segment competes in the real estate sales and development market, primarily in the Charleston, SC region.

Because all of our businesses operate in highly competitive industry segments, we regularly bid for sales opportunities to 
customers for new business or for renewal of existing business. Our packaging products compete with packaging made from other 
materials. The primary competitive factors we face include price, design, product innovation, quality and service, with varying 
emphasis on these factors depending on the product line and customer preferences. We believe that we compete effectively with 
respect to each of these factors and we evaluate our performance with annual customer surveys, among other means. 

The businesses we operate in have undergone consolidation. Within the packaging products industry, larger customers, with 
an expanded geographic presence, have tended to seek suppliers who can, because of their broad geographic presence, efficiently 

10

and economically supply all or a range of their packaging needs. In addition, our customers continue to demand higher quality 
products meeting stricter quality control requirements. 

See Item 1A. “Risk Factors — We Face Intense Competition” and “Risk Factors — We May Be Adversely Affected by U.S. 

and Worldwide Economic and Financial Market Conditions, and Social and Political Change”.

Governmental Regulation

Health and Safety Regulations

Our operations are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker 
health, including OSHA and related regulations. OSHA, among other things, establishes asbestos and noise standards and regulates 
the use of hazardous chemicals in the workplace. Although we do not use asbestos in manufacturing our products, ACM is present 
in some of our facilities. For those facilities where ACM is present, we have established procedures for properly managing the 
material, including, but not limited to, employee training and work practices to maintain the ACM in good condition and minimize 
exposure. We do not believe that future compliance with health and safety laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect 
on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

Environmental and Other Matters

Environmental compliance requirements are a significant factor affecting our business. We employ manufacturing processes 
that result in various discharges, emissions and wastes. These processes are subject to numerous federal, state, local and international 
environmental laws and regulations, as well as the requirements of environmental permits and similar authorizations issued by 
various governmental authorities. 

On January 31, 2013, the EPA published a set of four interrelated final rules establishing national air emissions standards for 
hazardous air pollutants from industrial, commercial and institutional boilers and process heaters, commonly known as “Boiler 
MACT.” Boiler MACT required compliance by January 31, 2016 or by January 31, 2017 for those mills for which we obtained 
a prior compliance extension. All work required for our boilers to comply with the rule has been completed. On July 29, 2016, 
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued a ruling on the consolidated cases challenging Boiler MACT. 
The court vacated key portions of the rule, including emission limits for certain subcategories of solid fuel boilers, and remanded 
other issues to the EPA for further rulemaking. At this time, we cannot predict with certainty how this decision will impact our 
existing Boiler MACT strategies or whether we will incur additional costs to comply with any revised Boiler MACT standards.

In addition to Boiler MACT, we are subject to a number of other federal, state, local and international environmental rules 
that may impact our business, including the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, fine 
particulate matter and ozone for facilities in the U.S. 

We are involved in various administrative proceedings relating to environmental matters that arise in the normal course of 
business, and may be involved in future matters. Although the ultimate outcome of such matters cannot be predicted with certainty 
and we cannot at this time estimate any reasonably possible losses based on available information, we do not believe that the 
currently expected outcome of any environmental proceedings and claims that are pending or threatened against us will have a 
material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. 

See Item 1A. “Risk Factors — We are Subject to Extensive and Costly Safety and Environmental Laws and 

Regulation”.

CERCLA and Other Remediation Costs

We face potential liability under federal, state, local and international laws as a result of releases, or threatened releases, of 
hazardous substances into the environment from various sites owned and operated by third parties at which Company-generated 
wastes have allegedly been deposited. Generators of hazardous substances sent to off-site disposal locations at which environmental 
problems exist, as well as the owners of those sites and certain other classes of persons, are liable for response costs for the 
investigation and remediation of such sites under CERCLA and analogous laws. While joint and several liability is authorized 
under CERCLA, liability is typically shared with other PRPs and costs are commonly allocated according to relative amounts of 
waste deposited and other factors.

In addition, certain of our current or former locations are being investigated or remediated under various environmental laws, 
including CERCLA, and regulations. Based on information known to us and assumptions, we do not believe that the costs of these 

11

projects will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. However, the discovery 
of contamination or the imposition of additional obligations at these or other sites in the future could result in additional costs.

On January 26, 2009, Smurfit-Stone and certain of its subsidiaries filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the 
U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Smurfit-Stone’s Canadian subsidiaries also filed to reorganize in Canada. We believe that matters relating 
to previously identified third party PRP sites and certain facilities formerly owned or operated by Smurfit-Stone have been or will 
be satisfied claims in the Smurfit-Stone bankruptcy proceedings. However, we may face additional liability for cleanup activity 
at sites that are not subject to the bankruptcy discharge, but are not currently identified. Some of these liabilities may be satisfied 
from existing bankruptcy reserves.

We believe that we can assert claims for indemnification pursuant to existing rights we have under purchase and other 
agreements in connection with certain of our existing remediation sites. In addition, we believe that we have insurance coverage, 
subject to applicable deductibles/retentions, policy limits and other conditions, for certain environmental matters. However, there 
can be no assurance that we will be successful with respect to any claim regarding these insurance or indemnification rights or 
that, if we are successful, any amounts paid pursuant to the insurance or indemnification rights will be sufficient to cover all our 
costs and expenses. We also cannot predict with certainty whether we will be required to perform remediation projects at other 
locations, and it is possible that our remediation requirements and costs could increase materially in the future and exceed current 
reserves. In addition, we cannot currently assess with certainty the impact that future changes in cleanup standards or federal, state 
or other environmental laws, regulations or enforcement practices will have on our results of operations, financial condition or 
cash flows.

We estimate that we will invest approximately $40 million for capital expenditures during fiscal 2018 in connection with 
matters  relating  to  environmental  compliance.  It  is  possible  that  our  capital  expenditure  assumptions  may  change,  project 
completion dates may change, and our projections are subject to change due to items such as the finalization of ongoing engineering 
and implementation work, the EPA determinations on Boiler MACT implementation issues and the outcomes of pending legal 
challenges to the rules. 

Climate Change

Certain jurisdictions in which we have manufacturing facilities or other investments have taken actions to address climate 
change. The EPA has issued the Clean Air Act permitting regulations applicable to certain facilities that emit GHG. The EPA also 
has promulgated a rule requiring certain industrial facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of carbon dioxide equivalent per 
year  to  file  an  annual  report  of  their  emissions. While  we  have  facilities  subject  to  existing  GHG  permitting  and  reporting 
requirements, the impact of these requirements has not been material to date.

Additionally, the EPA has been working on a set of interrelated rulemakings aimed at cutting carbon emissions from power 
plants. On August 3, 2015, the EPA issued a final rule establishing GHG emission guidelines for existing electric utility generating 
units (known as the “Clean Power Plan”). On the same day, the EPA issued a second rule setting standards of performance for 
new, modified and reconstructed electric utility generating units. While these rules do not apply directly to the power generation 
facilities at our mills, they have the potential to increase the cost of purchased electricity for our manufacturing operations and 
change the treatment of certain types of biomass that are currently considered carbon neutral. On February 9, 2016, the U.S. 
Supreme Court issued a stay halting implementation of the Clean Power Plan until the pending legal challenges to the rule are 
resolved. As directed by Executive Order, on April 4, 2017, the EPA issued a proposed rule announcing its intention to review the 
Clean Power Plan, and, if appropriate, initiate proceedings to suspend, revise or rescind it. A number of states subject to the Clean 
Power Plan have stopped working on their implementation strategies in response to the litigation and Executive Order; however, 
certain states where we operate manufacturing facilities have indicated their intention to continue their carbon reduction efforts. 
On October 16, 2017, the EPA issued a proposed rule that would repeal the Clean Power Plan. Due to ongoing litigation and other 
uncertainties regarding the Clean Power Plan, its impact on us cannot be quantified with certainty at this time. 

In addition to national efforts to regulate climate change, some U.S. states in which we have manufacturing operations are 
also taking measures to reduce GHG emissions, such as requiring GHG emissions reporting or developing regional cap-and trade 
programs. California has enacted a cap-and-trade program that took effect in 2012, and includes enforceable compliance obligations 
that  began  on  January  1,  2013.  In  July  2017,  California  extended  the  cap-and-trade  program  to  2030. We  do  not  have  any 
manufacturing facilities that are subject to the cap-and-trade requirements in California; however, we are continuing to monitor 
the implementation of this program as well as proposed mandatory GHG reduction efforts in other states. Also, the Washington 
Department of Ecology has issued a final rule, known as the Clean Air Rule, which limits GHGs from facilities that have average 
annual carbon dioxide equivalent emissions equal to or exceeding 100,000 metric tons/year and proposes to begin GHG emissions 
reduction requirements for some regulated entities in 2017. Energy intensive and trade exposed facilities and transportation fuel 
importers, including our Tacoma, WA mill, are subject to regulation under this program. In September 2016, various groups filed 

12

lawsuits against the Washington Department of Ecology challenging the Clean Air Rule. We are carefully monitoring this litigation 
to assess its potential impact on our Tacoma operations. On May 16, 2017, the Governor of Virginia issued Executive Directive 
11, directing the Secretary of Natural Resources to convene a work group to study and recommend methods to reduce carbon 
dioxide emissions from electric power facilities and grow the clean energy economy within existing state authority. We have been 
selected by the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality to participate in this work group.

The Paris Agreement established a framework for reducing global GHG emissions. By signing the Paris Agreement, the U.S. 
made a non-binding commitment to reduce economy-wide GHG emissions by 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by 2025. Other 
countries in which we conduct business, including China, European Union member states and India, have set similar GHG reduction 
targets. The Paris Agreement became effective on November 4, 2016. Although a party to the agreement may not provide the 
required one-year notice of withdrawal until three years after the effective date, in June 2017, President Trump announced that 
the U.S. intended to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. The governors of New York, California and Washington subsequently 
announced their intent to form a “climate alliance” to coordinate a state response to climate change. At this time, it is not possible 
to determine how the Paris Agreement, or any potential U.S. commitments in lieu of those under the agreement, may impact U.S. 
industrial facilities, including our domestic operations. 

Several of our international facilities are located in countries that have already adopted GHG emissions trading schemes. For 
example, Quebec has become a member of the Western Climate Initiative, which is a collaboration among California and certain 
Canadian provinces that have joined together to create a cap-and-trade program to reduce GHG emissions. In 2009, Quebec adopted 
a target of reducing GHG emissions by 20% below 1990 levels by 2020 and 37.5% from 1990 levels by 2030. In 2011, Quebec 
issued a final regulation establishing a regional cap-and-trade program that required reductions in GHG emissions from covered 
emitters as of January 1, 2013. Our mill in Quebec is subject to these cap-and-trade requirements, although the direct impact of 
this regulation has not been material to date. Compliance with this program and other similar programs may require future 
expenditures to meet required GHG emission reduction requirements in future years. 

The regulation of climate change continues to develop in the areas of the world where we conduct business. We have systems 
in place for tracking the GHG emissions from our energy-intensive facilities, and we carefully monitor developments in climate 
change laws, regulations and policies to assess the potential impact of such developments on our results of operations, financial 
condition, cash flows and disclosure obligations.

Patents and Other Intellectual Property

We hold a substantial number of foreign and domestic trademarks, trademark applications, trade names, patents, patent 
applications and licenses relating to our business, our products and our production processes. Our patent portfolio consists primarily 
of utility and design patents relating to our products and manufacturing operations. It also includes exclusive rights to substantial 
proprietary packaging system technology in the U.S. or other licenses obtained from a third party. Our brand name and logo, and 
certain of our products and services, are protected by domestic and foreign trademark rights. Our patents, trademarks and other 
intellectual property rights, particularly those relating to our converting operations, are important to our operations as a whole. 
Our intellectual property has various expiration dates. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors — We Depend On Our Ability to Develop and 
Successfully Introduce New Products and/or to Acquire and Retain Intellectual Property Rights”.

Employees

At September 30, 2017, we had approximately 44,800 employees, of which approximately 34,100 were located in the U.S. 
and Canada and 10,700 were located in Europe, South America, Mexico and Asia/Pacific. Of the approximately 44,800 employees, 
approximately 31,800 were hourly and approximately 13,000 were salaried. Approximately 13,900 of our hourly employees in 
the U.S. and Canada are covered by CBAs, which typically have four to six year terms. Approximately 2,500 of our employees 
in the U.S. and Canada are working under expired contracts and approximately 1,100 of our U.S. and Canada employees are 
covered under CBAs that expire within one year. Approximately 5,200 of our employees outside the U.S. and Canada are covered 
by agreements similar to CBAs, which most frequently have four to six year terms. Approximately 2,100 of our employees not 
based in the U.S. and Canada are working under expired agreements and approximately 1,100 of them are covered under agreements 
that expire within one year.

While we have experienced isolated work stoppages in the past, we have been able to resolve them and we believe that working 
relationships with our employees are generally good. While the terms of our CBAs vary, we believe the material terms of the 
agreements are customary for the industry, the type of facility, the classification of the employees and the geographic location 
covered.

13

In October 2014, we entered into a master agreement with the USW that applied to substantially all of our legacy RockTenn 
facilities represented by the USW at that time. The agreement has a six year term and covers a number of specific items, including 
wages, medical coverage and certain other benefit programs, substance abuse testing and successorship. Individual facilities will 
continue to have local agreements for subjects not covered by the master agreement and those agreements will continue to have 
staggered terms. Wage increases specified in the master agreement will not begin until the local facility agreements have been 
negotiated and ratified. The master agreement permits us to apply its terms to USW employees who work at facilities we acquire 
during the term of the agreement. The master agreement covers 59 of our U.S. facilities and approximately 6,800 of our employees.

See Item 1A. “Risk Factors — We May Be Adversely Impacted By Work Stoppages and Other Labor Relations Matters”.

International Operations

Our operations outside the U.S. are conducted through subsidiaries located in Canada, Mexico, South America, Europe, Asia 
and Australia. Sales attributable to non-U.S. operations were 17.6%, 17.1% and 13.5% of our net sales in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 
2015,  respectively,  some  of  which  were  transacted  in  U.S.  dollars.  See  “Note  21.  Segment  Information”  of  the  Notes  to 
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors — We are Exposed to Risks Related 
to International Sales and Operations”.

Item 1A. 

 RISK FACTORS

We are subject to certain risks and events that, if one or more occur, could adversely affect our results of operations, cash 
flows and financial condition, and the trading price of our Common Stock. In evaluating us, our business and a potential investment 
in our securities, you should consider the following risk factors and the other information presented in this report, as well as the 
other reports and registration statements we file from time to time with the SEC. The risks addressed below are not the only ones 

16

we face. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial could also adversely impact our business 
in the future.

We May Fail to Realize the Anticipated Benefits of the Combination

The success of the Combination will depend on, among other things, our ability to combine the RockTenn and MWV businesses 
in a manner that facilitates growth opportunities, realizes anticipated synergies and achieves the identified projected cost savings 
and revenue growth trends. In connection with the Combination, we set a $1.0 billion run rate synergy and performance improvement 
target, before inflation, to be realized by June 30, 2018. At September 30, 2017, we had achieved a run rate of $840 million. We 
expected, and continue to expect, to (a) benefit from operational synergies resulting from the consolidation of capabilities and the 
elimination of redundancies, as well as greater efficiencies from increased scale and market integration and (b) realize revenue 
synergies  through  an  expanded  and  complementary  product  offering  and  increased  geographic  reach.  However,  we  must 
successfully combine the RockTenn and MWV businesses in a manner that permits these cost savings and synergies to be realized. 
In addition, we must achieve the anticipated cost savings and synergies without adversely affecting current revenues and investments 
in future growth. 

Achieving the anticipated benefits of the Combination is subject to a number of uncertainties, including market conditions, 
risks related to our businesses and whether we consolidate certain businesses and functions of RockTenn and MWV in an efficient, 
effective  and  timely  manner.  In  particular,  we  may  face  significant  challenges  integrating  the  companies’  technologies, 
organizations, procedures, policies and operations, addressing differences in their business cultures and retaining key personnel. 
The integration may also be more difficult, complex, costly and time consuming than we expect, and the integration process and 
other disruptions resulting from the Combination may disrupt ongoing businesses or cause inconsistencies in standards, controls, 
procedures  and  policies  that  adversely  affect  our  relationships  with  employees,  suppliers,  customers  and  others  with  whom 
RockTenn and MWV had business or other dealings, or otherwise limit our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the 
Combination.

If we are not able to successfully combine the RockTenn and MWV businesses within the anticipated time frame, or at all, 
the expected cost savings and synergies and other benefits of the Combination may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take 
longer to realize than expected, the combined businesses may not perform as expected, management’s time and energy may be 
diverted, and our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the trading price of our Common Stock, could be 
adversely affected.

We May Experience Pricing Variability

Our businesses have experienced, and are likely to continue experiencing, cycles relating to industry capacity and general 
economic conditions. The length and magnitude of these cycles have varied over time and by product. Prices for our products are 
driven by many factors, including general economic conditions, demand for our products and competitive conditions in the industries 
within which we compete, and we have little influence over the timing and extent of price changes, which may be unpredictable 
and volatile. If supply exceeds demand, prices for our products could decline, and our results of operations, cash flows and financial 
condition, and the trading price of our Common Stock could be adversely affected. Further, certain published indices contribute 
to the setting of selling prices for some of our products. Future changes in how these indices are established or maintained could 
adversely impact the selling prices for these products. 

Our Earnings Are Highly Dependent on Volumes

Because our operations generally have high fixed operating cost components, our earnings are highly dependent on volumes, 
which tend to fluctuate. These fluctuations make it difficult to predict our financial results with any degree of certainty. Any failure 
to maintain volumes may adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the trading price of 
our Common Stock.

We May Face Increased Costs or Inadequate Availability of Raw Materials, Energy and Transportation

We rely heavily on the use of certain raw materials, energy sources and third-party companies to transport our goods. 

The costs of recovered paper and virgin fiber, the principal externally sourced raw materials for our mills, are subject to pricing 
variability due to market and industry conditions. Increasing demand for products packaged in 100% recycled paper, greater 
demand for U.S.-sourced recovered paper by Asian-based paper manufacturers and the shift by manufacturers of virgin paperboard, 
tissue, newsprint and corrugated packaging to the production of products with some recycled paper content have and may continue 
to increase demand for recovered paper, which may result in cost increases. Certain published indices contribute to price setting 

17

for some of our raw materials. Future changes in how these indices are established or maintained could adversely impact the 
pricing of these raw materials.

The cost of natural gas, which we use in many of our manufacturing operations, including many of our mills, and other energy 
costs (including energy generated by burning natural gas, fuel oil, biomass and coal) has at times fluctuated significantly. High 
energy costs could increase our operating costs and make our products less competitive compared to similar or alternative products 
offered by competitors.

We distribute our products primarily by truck and rail, although we also distribute some of our products by cargo ship. The 
reduced availability of trucks, rail cars or cargo ships could negatively impact our ability to distribute our products in a timely 
manner, and high transportation costs could make our products less competitive compared to similar or alternative products offered 
by competitors. 

Because all of our businesses operate in highly competitive industry segments, we may not be able to recoup past or future 
increases in the cost of raw materials, energy or transportation through price increases for our products. The failure to obtain raw 
materials, energy or transportation services at reasonable market prices (or the failure to pass on price increases to our customers) 
or a reduction in the availability of raw materials, energy or transportation services due to increased demand, significant changes 
in climate or weather conditions, or other factors could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, 
and the trading price of our Common Stock.

We Face Intense Competition

We compete in industries that are highly competitive, and no single company dominates an industry. Our competitors include 
large and small, vertically integrated companies and numerous smaller non-integrated companies. We generally compete with 
companies operating in North America, although we have operations spanning North America, South America, Europe, Asia and 
Australia. Competition from domestic or non-U.S. lower cost or more innovative manufacturers could adversely impact our sales 
volumes and pricing, as could other actions taken by our competitors, including reducing the prices of their products, improving 
the quality of their products or enhancing their marketing or sales activities. In addition, changes within these industries, including 
the consolidation of our competitors and our customers, have occurred and may continue to occur, which may adversely affect 
our competitiveness. To the extent our competitors are more successful than we are with respect to any key competitive factor, 
our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the trading price of our Common Stock, could be adversely 
affected.

 
Our products also compete, to some extent, with various other packaging materials, including products made of paper, plastics, 
wood and various types of metal. Customer shifts away from paperboard and containerboard packaging to packaging made from 
other materials could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the trading price of our 
Common Stock.

We May Be Unsuccessful in Making and Integrating Mergers, Acquisitions and Investments and Completing Divestitures

We have completed a number of mergers, acquisitions, investments and divestitures in recent years, including the Combination, 
our investment in Grupo Gondi, the Separation, the HH&B Sale and the MPS Acquisition, and we may acquire, invest in or sell, 
or enter into joint ventures with additional companies. We may not be able to identify suitable targets or purchasers or successfully 
complete suitable transactions in the future and completed transactions may not be successful. These transactions create risks, 
including, but not limited to, risks associated with:

•  disrupting our ongoing business, including distracting management from our existing businesses;
•  integrating acquired businesses and personnel into our business;
•  working with partners or other ownership structures with shared decision-making authority;
•  obtaining and verifying relevant information regarding a business prior to the consummation of the transaction, including 
the identification and assessment of liabilities, claims or other circumstances that could result in litigation or regulatory risk 
exposure; 

•  obtaining required regulatory approvals and/or financing on favorable terms;
•  retaining key employees, contractual relationships or customers;
•  the potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets and goodwill;
•  the additional operating losses and expenses of businesses we acquire or in which we invest;
•  implementing controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company at companies we acquire;
•  the dilution of interests of holders of our Common Stock through the issuance of equity securities; and

18

•  integrating operations across different cultures and languages, and the economic, political and regulatory risks associated 

with specific countries.

Further, the benefits we expect to achieve as a result of these transactions depend, in part, on our ability to realize anticipated 
growth opportunities, cost savings and synergies. Our success in realizing these opportunities and synergies and the timing of 
realizing them depend on the successful integration of the acquired businesses and operations with our business and operations. 
Even if we are able to integrate these businesses and operations successfully, we may not realize the full benefits of the growth 
opportunities and synergies we expected within the anticipated timeframe, or at all. Accordingly, the benefits from these acquisitions 
may be offset by unanticipated costs or delays in integrating the acquired companies. 

Mergers, acquisitions and investments may not be successful and may adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows 

and financial condition, and the trading price of our Common Stock.

We May Be Adversely Affected by U.S. and Worldwide Economic and Financial Market Conditions, and Social and Political 

Change 

Our businesses may be affected by a number of factors that are beyond our control, such as general economic and business 
conditions; changes in tax laws or tax rates and conditions in the financial services markets, including counterparty risk, insurance 
carrier risk, rising interest rates, inflation, deflation, fluctuations in the value of local currency versus the U.S. dollar and the impact 
of a stronger U.S. dollar; financial uncertainties in our major international markets, including uncertainties surrounding the United 
Kingdom’s impending withdrawal from the European Union, commonly referred to as “Brexit”; social and political change 
impacting matters such as environmental regulations and trade policies; sluggish or uneven recovery, government deficit reduction 
and other austerity measures in specific countries or regions, or in the various industries in which we operate; or other factors, 
each of which may adversely impact our ability to compete. Macro-economic challenges, including conditions in financial and 
capital markets and levels of unemployment, and the ability of the U.S. and other countries to address their rising debt levels may 
continue to put pressure on the economy or lead to changes in tax laws or tax rates that may have a material impact on our future 
cash taxes, effective tax rate or deferred tax assets and liabilities. Adverse developments in the U.S. and global economy, including 
locations such as Europe, Brazil, Mexico, India and China, could adversely affect the demand for our products, our revenues and 
our manufacturing costs. We are not able to predict with certainty economic and financial market conditions, and social and political 
change, and our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the trading price of our Common Stock, could be 
adversely affected by adverse market conditions and social and political change.

 

Our Joint Ventures May Limit Our Flexibility with Respect to These Jointly Owned Investments 

We have invested in joint ventures when circumstances warranted the use of these structures, and we may form additional 
joint ventures in the future. Our participation in joint ventures is subject to risks, including, but not limited to, risks associated 
with:

•  shared decision-making, which could require us to expend additional resources to resolve impasses or potential disputes;
•  maintaining good relationships with our partners, which could limit our future growth potential;
•  conflict of interest issues if our partners have competing interests;
•  investment  or  operational  goals  that  conflict  with  our  partners’  goals,  including  the  timing,  terms  and  strategies  for 

investments or future growth opportunities;

•  our partners’ ability to fund their share of required capital contributions or to otherwise fulfill their obligations as partners, 
which may require us to infuse our own capital into these ventures on behalf of the related partner despite other competing 
uses for capital; and

•  obtaining consents from our partners for any sale or other disposition of our interest in a joint venture or underlying assets 

of the joint venture.

Our Investment in Grupo Gondi May Require Us to Utilize Our Cash Flow or Incur Additional Indebtedness to Satisfy 

Certain Payment Obligations 
  
In connection with our investment in the joint venture with Grupo Gondi, we entered into an option agreement pursuant to 
which we and certain shareholders of Grupo Gondi agreed to future put and call options with respect to the equity interests in the 
joint venture held by each party. These put and call arrangements may require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow 
to satisfy our payment obligations in respect of these arrangements, which may reduce the amount of funds available for our 
operations,  capital  expenditures  and  corporate  development  activities.  Similarly,  we  may  be  required  to  incur  additional 
indebtedness to satisfy our payment obligations in respect of these arrangements.

19

We are Exposed to Risks Related to International Sales and Operations

We predominately operate in U.S. markets, but derived 17.6% of our net sales in fiscal 2017 from outside the U.S. through 
international operations or exports to foreign customers, some of which were transacted in U.S. dollars. We are exposed to risks 
of operating in many countries, including, but not limited to, risks associated with:

•  the difficulties with and costs of complying with a wide variety of complex laws, treaties and regulations;
•  unexpected changes in political or regulatory environments; earnings and cash flows that may be subject to tax withholding 

requirements or the imposition of tariffs, exchange controls or other restrictions;

•  repatriating cash from foreign countries to the U.S.;
•  political and economic instability;
•  import and export restrictions and other trade barriers; 
•  maintaining overseas subsidiaries and managing international operations;
•  obtaining approval for significant transactions;
•  government limitations on foreign ownership;
•  government takeovers or nationalizations of business;
•  government mandated price controls; 
•  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; and
•  transfer pricing.

Any one or more of these risks could adversely affect our international operations and our results of operations, cash flows 

and financial condition, and the trading price of our Common Stock.

The Future Success of our International Operations Could be Adversely Affected by Violations or Alleged Violations of the 

Anti-Bribery Laws

The FCPA and local anti-bribery laws, including those in Brazil, Mexico and India (where we maintain operations directly or 
through a joint venture), prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for 
the purpose of influencing official decisions. Our policies mandate compliance with anti-bribery laws, including the FCPA. Our 
internal control policies and procedures, or those of our vendors, may not adequately protect us from reckless or criminal acts 
committed or alleged to have been committed by our employees, agents or vendors. Any such allegations could lead to civil or 
criminal monetary and non-monetary penalties and/or could damage our reputation. Violations of these laws, or allegations of 
such violations, could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the trading price of our 
Common Stock.

We Depend on Certain Large Customers

Our corrugated packaging segment and consumer packaging segment each have large customers, the loss of which could 
adversely affect the segment’s sales and, depending on the significance of the loss, our results of operations, cash flows and financial 
condition, and the trading price of our Common Stock. In particular, because our businesses operate in highly competitive industry 
segments, we regularly bid for new business or for the renewal of existing business. The loss of business from our larger customers, 
or the renewal of business on less favorable terms, may adversely impact our financial results.

We May Fail to Anticipate Trends That Would Enable Us to Offer Products That Respond to Changing Customer Preferences 

Our success depends, in part, on our ability to offer differentiated solutions, and we must continually develop and introduce 
new products and services in a timely manner to keep pace with technological and regulatory developments and achieve customer 
acceptance. The services and products we offer customers may not meet their needs as their business models evolve, or our 
customers may decide to decrease or use alternative materials for their product packaging or forego the packaging of certain 
products entirely. Regulatory developments can also significantly alter the market for our solutions. For example, a move to 
electronic  distribution  of  disclaimers  and  other  paperless  regimes  could  negatively  impact  our  healthcare  inserts  and  labels 
businesses. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to identify and respond promptly to changes in customer preferences, 
expectations and needs. Our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the trading price of our Common Stock, 
could be adversely affected if we fail to anticipate trends that would enable us to offer products that respond to changing customer 
preferences.

20

We May Produce Faulty or Contaminated Products Due to Failures in Quality Control Measures and Systems

We maintain quality control measures and systems to ensure the safety and quality of our products. The consequences of a 
product not meeting these standards could be severe. These consequences may include adverse effects on consumer health, litigation 
exposure, loss of market share and adverse financial impacts. If our products fail to meet our standards, we may be required to 
incur substantial costs in taking appropriate corrective action (up to and including recalling products from end consumers) and to 
reimburse customers and/or end consumers for losses that they suffer as a result of this failure. Customers and end consumers may 
seek to recover these losses through litigation and, under applicable legal rules, may succeed in any such claim despite there being 
no negligence or other fault on our part. Placing an unsafe product on the market, failing to notify the regulatory authorities of a 
safety issue, failing to take appropriate corrective action and failing to meet other regulatory requirements relating to product 
safety could lead to regulatory investigation, enforcement action and/or prosecution. Any product quality or safety issue may also 
result in adverse publicity, which may damage our reputation. Any of these results could adversely affect our results of operations, 
cash flows and financial condition, and the trading price of our Common Stock.

In certain contracts, we provide guarantees that our products are produced in accordance with customer specifications regarding 
the proper functioning of our products and the conformity of a product to the specific use defined by the customer. In addition, if 
the product contained in packaging manufactured by us is faulty or contaminated, the manufacturer of the product may allege that 
the packaging we provided caused the fault or contamination, even if the packaging complies with contractual specifications. If 
certain of our packaging fails to open properly or to preserve the integrity of its contents, we could face liability to our customers 
and to third parties for bodily injury or other tangible or intangible damages suffered as a result. Such liability, if it were to be 
established in relation to a sufficient volume of claims or to claims for sufficiently large amounts, could adversely affect our results 
of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the trading price of our Common Stock.

We May Incur Business Disruptions

The operations at our manufacturing facilities may be interrupted or impaired by various operating risks, including, but not 

limited to, risks associated with:

•  catastrophic events, such as fires, floods, explosions, natural disasters, severe weather, including hurricanes, or other similar 

occurrences;

•  interruptions in the delivery of raw materials or other manufacturing inputs;
•  adverse government regulations;
•  equipment breakdowns or failures;
•  unscheduled maintenance;
•  information system failures;
•  violations of our permit requirements or revocation of permits;
•  releases of pollutants and hazardous substances to air, soil, surface water or ground water;
•  shortages of equipment or spare parts; and
•  labor disputes.

For example, in fiscal 2017, operations at a number of our facilities were interrupted by several hurricanes. We lost mill 
production at certain of these facilities and incurred damages, supply chain disruptions and increased input costs associated with 
these hurricanes. 

The occurrence of any of the events noted above may impair our production capabilities and adversely affect our results of 

operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the trading price of our Common Stock. 

Interest Rate Increases Could Impact Our Financial Condition

We maintain levels of fixed and floating rate debt that we consider prudent based on our cash flows (and other financial 
metrics) and our business outlook, and these levels may vary over time. Our floating rate debt exposes us to changes in interest 
rates. We utilize fixed rate debt and, from time to time, derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate 
risks. However, our financial risk management may not be successful in reducing the risks inherent in exposures to interest rate 
fluctuations, which could adversely affect our financial condition and the trading price of our Common Stock. 

Downgrades in our Credit Ratings Could Increase our Borrowing Costs

Some of our outstanding indebtedness has received credit ratings from rating agencies. These ratings are limited in scope and 
do not purport to address all risks relating to an investment in those debt securities. Our credit ratings could change based on, 

21

among other things, our results of operations and financial condition. These ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit 
rating agencies, and they may be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency or placed on a so-called “watch 
list” for a possible downgrade or assigned a negative ratings outlook if, in any rating agency’s judgment, circumstances so warrant. 
Actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under review 
for a downgrade or have been assigned a negative outlook, would likely increase our borrowing costs, which could in turn adversely 
affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the trading price of our Common Stock. If a downgrade 
or negative outlook were to occur, it could impact our ability to access the capital markets to raise debt and/or increase the cost 
thereof. In addition, while our credit ratings are important to us, we may take actions and otherwise operate our business in a 
manner that adversely affects our credit ratings. 

We are Subject to Extensive and Costly Safety and Environmental Laws and Regulations

We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign safety and environmental laws and regulations, including those 
regulating the discharge, storage, handling and disposal of a variety of substances, the chemicals used in our operations, air 
emissions and water discharges from our facilities, the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater, the environmental impacts 
of our finished products and the health and safety of our employees.

We regularly make capital expenditures to maintain compliance with applicable safety and environmental laws and regulations; 
however, these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly stringent. Consequently, our compliance costs could increase 
materially, which could materially adversely affect our competitive position. In addition, we cannot currently assess the impact 
of future changes in governmental regulations or governments’ enforcement practices will have on our operations or capital 
expenditure requirements. For example, our manufacturing operations consume significant amounts of energy, and we may in the 
future  incur  additional  or  increased  capital  and  operating  costs  from  changes  due  to  increased  climate-related  and  other 
environmental regulations.

In addition to environmental regulations, we are responsible for conducting environmental investigation and cleanup activities 
at current and formerly owned sites. We also have been identified as a PRP at various third-party disposal sites. Any liability or 
damages we may incur in connection with these or other sites at which we may be identified in the future as a PRP or in connection 
with  safety  or  environmental  requirements,  including  capital  investments  or  business  disruptions  associated  with  regulatory 
compliance, may adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the trading price of our Common 
Stock. 

Our Capital Expenditures May Not Achieve the Desired Outcomes or May Be Achieved at a Higher Cost than Anticipated

We regularly make capital expenditures. Many of our projects are complex, costly and/or implemented over an extended 
period of time. Consequently, our capital expenditures could be higher than we anticipated, we may experience unanticipated 
business disruptions and/or we may not achieve the desired benefits from these projects, any of which could adversely affect our 
results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the trading price of our Common Stock. In addition, disputes between 
us and contractors who are involved with implementing projects could lead to time-consuming and costly litigation.

We May Incur Additional Restructuring Costs and May Not Realize Expected Benefits from Restructuring

We have previously restructured portions of our operations, and we may engage in future restructuring initiatives. Because 
we are not able to predict with certainty market conditions, including changes in the supply and demand for our products, the loss 
of large customers, the selling prices for our products, or the cost of manufacturing our products, we also may not be able to predict 
with certainty the appropriate time to undertake restructurings. The cash and non-cash costs associated with these activities will 
vary depending upon the type of facility impacted, with the non-cash cost of a mill closure generally being more significant than 
that of a converting facility due to the higher level of investment. These activities may divert the attention of management, disrupt 
our operations and fail to achieve the intended cost and operations benefits.

22

We May Be Adversely Impacted By Work Stoppages and Other Labor Relations Matters

A significant number of our union employees are governed by CBAs. Expired contracts are in the process of renegotiation, 
and others expire within one year. We may not be able to successfully negotiate new union contracts without work stoppages or 
labor difficulties or renegotiate them on favorable terms. We have experienced work stoppages in the past and we may experience 
work stoppages in the future. If we are unable to successfully renegotiate the terms of any of these agreements or an industry 
association is unable to successfully negotiate a national agreement when it expires, or if we experience any extended interruption 
of operations at any of our facilities as a result of strikes or other work stoppages, our results of operations, cash flows and financial 
condition, and the trading price of our Common Stock, could be adversely affected. 

In addition, our businesses rely on certain vendors, suppliers and other third parties that have union employees. Strikes or 
work stoppages at these vendors, suppliers and other third parties could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and 
financial condition, and the trading price of our Common Stock.

We May Incur Increased Employee Benefit Costs and Certain of Our Pension Plans Will Likely Require Additional Cash 

Contributions

Employee healthcare costs continue to rise. Our pension plan contribution and health care benefits costs depend on multiple 
factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience. While the Plan is over funded, we expect to 
make future contributions primarily to our non-U.S. pension plans in the coming years in order to ensure that our funding levels 
remain adequate and meet regulatory requirements. The actual required amounts and timing of future cash contributions will be 
highly sensitive to changes in the applicable discount rates and returns on plan assets, and could also be impacted by future changes 
in the laws and regulations applicable to plan funding. Our pension plan assets are primarily made up of fixed income, equity and 
alternative investments. Fluctuations in the market performance of these assets and changes in interest rates may result in increased 
or decreased pension plan costs in future periods. Changes in assumptions regarding expected long-term rate of return on plan 
assets, our discount rate, expected compensation levels or mortality could also increase or decrease pension costs. These changes, 
along with turmoil in financial and capital markets, may adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial 
condition, and the trading price of our Common Stock. 

We May Incur Withdrawal Liability and/or Increased Funding Requirements in Connection with the MEPPs in Which We 

Participate

We participate in several MEPPs that provide retirement benefits to certain union employees in accordance with various CBAs. 
Our contributions to a particular MEPP are established by the applicable CBAs; however, our required contributions may increase 
based on the declining funded status of an MEPP and legal requirements, such as those of the Pension Act, which require substantially 
underfunded MEPPs to implement a FIP or a RP to improve their funded status. Factors that could impact the funded status of a 
MEPP include, without limitation, a shrinking contribution base as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other companies 
that currently contribute to these plans, the inability or failure of companies withdrawing from the plan to pay their withdrawal 
liability, low interest rates, changes in actuarial assumptions and/or lower than expected returns on pension fund assets.

We believe that certain of the MEPPs in which we participate, including PIUMPF, have material unfunded vested benefits. 
In the normal course of business, we evaluate our potential exposure to MEPPs, including with respect to potential withdrawal 
liabilities. We are considering withdrawing from one or more MEPPs. It is reasonably possible that we may incur significant 
withdrawal liabilities with respect to certain MEPPs in connection with such withdrawal(s). Our withdrawal liability for any 
particular MEPP would depend on the nature and timing of any triggering event and the extent of that MEPP’s funding of vested 
benefits. In addition, we may be obligated to pay a share of a particular MEPP’s accumulated funding deficiency as determined 
under the Pension Act. Due to the absence of specific information regarding the applicable funded status and other relevant 
information for each MEPP, we are unable to determine with certainty the exact amount of any withdrawal liability. However, 
based on available information, including the MEPP’s latest available actuarial valuation reports and annual funding notices, we 
believe our withdrawal liability would be approximately $140 million to $200 million if we were to withdraw from all of the 
MEPPs in which we participate prior to the end of calendar 2017. The foregoing estimate assumes payment of the liabilities over 
20 years discounted at 5% and excludes the potential impact of future mass withdrawals. 

The impact of increased contributions, future funding obligations or future withdrawal liabilities may adversely affect our 
results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the trading price of our Common Stock. See “Note 15. Retirement 
Plans — Multiemployer Plans” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

23

We are Subject to Cyber-Security Risks, Including Related to Customer, Employee, Vendor or Other Company Data and 

Including in Connection with Integration of Acquired Businesses and Operations

We  use  information  technologies  to  securely  manage  operations  and  various  business  functions.  We  rely  on  various 
technologies, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage 
or support a variety of business processes and activities, including reporting on our business and interacting with customers, 
vendors and employees. In addition, we collect and store certain data, including proprietary business information, and may have 
access to confidential or personal information in certain of our segments that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations 
and customer-imposed controls. Our systems are subject to repeated attempts by third parties to access information or to disrupt 
our systems. Despite our security design and controls, and those of our third-party providers, we may become subject to system 
damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to any number of causes, including cyber-attacks, breaches, employee error or malfeasance, 
power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures, systems failures, service providers, natural disasters or 
other catastrophic events. It is possible for such vulnerabilities to remain undetected for an extended period, up to and including 
several years. We may face other challenges and risks as we upgrade and standardize our information technology systems as part 
of our integration of acquired businesses and operations. We have contingency plans in place to prevent or mitigate the impact of 
these events, however, these events could result in operational disruptions or the misappropriation of sensitive data, and depending 
on their nature and scope, could lead to the compromise of confidential information, improper use of our systems and networks, 
manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions and exposure to 
liability. Such disruptions or misappropriations and the resulting repercussions, including reputational damage and legal claims 
or proceedings, may adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the trading price of our 
Common Stock.

We Depend On Our Ability to Develop and Successfully Introduce New Products and/or to Acquire and Retain Intellectual 

Property Rights 

Our ability to develop and successfully market new products and to develop, acquire and/or retain necessary intellectual 
property rights is important to our continued success and competitive position. If we are unable to develop and successfully 
introduce new products, protect our existing intellectual property rights, or develop new rights or if others develop similar or 
improved technologies, our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the trading price of our Common Stock, 
could be adversely affected.

We are Subject to Risks Associated with Monetizing our Land and Development Asset Portfolio

Our land and development segment has historically engaged in value-added real estate development activities in the Charleston, 
SC region, including obtaining entitlements and establishing joint ventures and other development-related arrangements. In fiscal 
2016, we commenced an accelerated monetization strategy of our land and development asset portfolio that we expect to complete 
in fiscal 2018. Our ability to execute our plans may be affected by general economic conditions, including credit markets and 
interest rates, local real estate market conditions, including competition from sellers of land and real estate developers, and the 
impact of federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting land use, land use entitlements, land protection and zoning, among 
other factors. Any failure to execute our plans could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, 
and the trading price of our Common Stock.

We are Subject to Risks Associated with the Relocation of Our Principal Offices

We are in the process of relocating our principal offices from Norcross, GA to Sandy Springs, GA and we expect to complete 
the relocation in the first half of fiscal 2018.  We may not complete the relocation during the expected timeframe and we may not 
effectively transition our workforce to the new location, in which case we could experience business disruption due to a loss of 
historical knowledge and a lack of business continuity. In addition, we may not realize the expected benefits of the relocation as 
a result of business disruption or other factors. 

We May Fail to Attract, Motivate, Train and Retain Qualified Personnel, Including Key Personnel

Our ability to maintain or expand our business depends on our ability to attract, motivate, train and retain employees with the 
skills necessary to understand and adapt to the continuously developing needs of our customers. The increasing demand for qualified 
personnel makes it more difficult for us to attract and retain employees with requisite skill sets, particularly employees with 
specialized technical and trade experience. Changing demographics and labor work force trends also may result in a loss of 
knowledge and skills as experienced workers retire. If we fail to attract, motivate, train and retain qualified personnel, or if we 
experience  excessive  turnover,  we  may  experience  declining  sales,  manufacturing  delays  or  other  inefficiencies,  increased 

24

recruiting, training and relocation costs and other difficulties, and our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, 
and the trading price of our Common Stock may be adversely impacted. 

In addition, we rely on key executive and management personnel to manage our business efficiently and effectively.  As our 
business has grown in size and geographic scope, we have relied on these individuals to manage increasingly complex projects, 
teams and operations, and to allocate resources to match the size and geographic scope of our business. The loss of any of our key 
personnel could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the trading price of our Common 
Stock may be adversely impacted.

The Separation Could Result in Substantial Tax Liability to Us and to Those of Our Stockholders Who Received Ingevity 

Stock at the Time of the Separation

We have received an opinion from outside tax counsel to the effect that the Separation qualifies as a transaction that is described 
in Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code. The opinion relies on certain facts, assumptions, representations 
and undertakings from Ingevity and us regarding the past and future conduct of each of the two companies’ respective businesses 
and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings prove to be incorrect or not satisfied, or if 
the IRS otherwise determines on audit that the Separation is taxable, our stockholders who received Ingevity stock at the time of 
the Separation and/or we may not be able to rely on the opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. 
If the Separation is determined to be taxable, those of our stockholders who received Ingevity stock at the time of the Separation 
and/or we could be subject to a substantial tax liability. If the Separation is determined to be taxable to those of our stockholders 
who received Ingevity stock at the time of the Separation, each of those stockholders would generally be treated as having received 
a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the Ingevity shares received.

Even if the Separation otherwise qualifies as a tax-free transaction to those of our stockholders who received Ingevity stock 
at the time of the Separation, the distribution could be taxable to us in certain circumstances if future significant acquisitions of 
our stock or the stock of Ingevity are determined to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that included the Separation. 
In this event, the resulting tax liability would be substantial. In connection with the Separation, we entered into a tax matters 
agreement with Ingevity, pursuant to which Ingevity agreed (a) to not engage in certain transactions that could cause the Separation 
to be taxable to us and (b) to indemnify us for any tax liabilities resulting from such transactions. The indemnity from Ingevity 
may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities. Any tax liabilities resulting from the Separation or 
related transactions could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the trading price of 
our Common Stock.

We May Be Exposed to Claims and Liabilities as a Result of the Separation

We entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements with Ingevity to govern the Separation 
and the relationship of the two companies going forward. These agreements provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations 
and could lead to disputes between us and Ingevity. The indemnity rights we have against Ingevity under the agreements may not 
be sufficient to protect us. In addition, our indemnity obligations to Ingevity may be significant and these risks could adversely 
affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the trading price of our Common Stock.

The production at our Lynchburg, VA mill is gypsum paperboard liner and the paper machine is owned by our Seven Hills 

 
At September 30, 2017, we owned approximately 27,000 acres of development landholdings primarily in the Charleston, SC 

region and approximately 135,000 acres of forestlands in Brazil.

 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We are a defendant in a number of lawsuits and claims arising out of the conduct of our business. While the ultimate results 
of such suits or other proceedings against us cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the resolution of these matters will not 
have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

The range of prices in the table above is impacted by the Separation subsequent to May 15, 2016. On that date, Ingevity 
became an independent public company trading under the symbol “NGVT” on the NYSE. Under the terms of the Separation, 
WestRock stockholders received one share of Ingevity common stock for every six shares of Common Stock held as of the close 
of business on May 4, 2016. 

In October 2017, our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.43 per share, representing a 7.5% increase from 
the prior $0.40 per share quarterly dividend and an annual dividend of $1.72 per share. During fiscal 2017, we paid quarterly 
dividends of $0.40 per share for an annual dividend of $1.60 per share, representing a 6.7% increase from the prior year. During 
fiscal 2016, we paid quarterly dividends of $0.375 per share for an annual dividend of $1.50 per share. See Item 6. “Selected 
Financial Data” for additional information.

Item 6. 

SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

The following selected consolidated financial data should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements 
and notes thereto and Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”. 
RockTenn was the accounting acquirer in the Combination; therefore, the historical consolidated financial statements of RockTenn 
for periods prior to the Combination are considered to be the historical financial statements of WestRock and thus WestRock’s 
consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2015 reflect RockTenn’s consolidated financial statements for periods from October 
1, 2014 through June 30, 2015, and WestRock’s thereafter. We derived the consolidated statements of operations and consolidated 
statements of cash flows data for the years ended September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015 and the consolidated balance sheet data as 
of  September 30,  2017  and  2016  from  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  included  herein. We  derived  the  consolidated 
statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows data for the year ended September 30, 2014 and the consolidated 
balance sheet data as of September 30, 2015 from audited WestRock Company consolidated financial statements not included in 
this report. We derived the consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows data for the year ended 
September 30, 2013 and the consolidated balance sheet data as of September 30, 2014 and 2013, from audited Rock-Tenn Company 
consolidated financial statements not included in this report. The table that follows is consistent with those presentations with the 
exception of diluted earnings per share attributable to common stockholders, diluted weighted average shares outstanding, dividends 
per common share and book value per common share that have been adjusted retroactively due to RockTenn’s August 2014 two-
for-one stock split. 

The Combination was the primary reason for the changes in the selected financial data in fiscal 2016 and 2015 as compared 
to prior years due to the size and timing of the transaction. The selected financial data has been updated to reflect the Separation. 
Our results of operations shown below may not be indicative of future results.

In fiscal 2016, we used plan assets to settle $2.5 billion of pension obligations of the Plan by purchasing group annuity contracts 
from  Prudential.  This  transaction  transferred  payment  responsibility  to  Prudential  for  retirement  benefits  owed  to 
approximately 35,000 U.S. retirees and their beneficiaries. As a result, we recorded a non-cash charge of $370.7 million pre-
tax. See “Note 15. Retirement Plans” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 

In fiscal 2017, lump sum payments to certain beneficiaries of the Plan, together with several one-time severance benefit 
payments out of the Plan, triggered pension settlement accounting and a remeasurement of the Plan. As a result of settlement 
accounting,  we  recognized  as  a  current  period  expense  a  pro-rata  portion  of  the  unamortized  net  actuarial  loss,  after 
remeasurement, and recorded a $32.6 million non-cash charge to our earnings. In fiscal 2015, payments were made to former 
employees to partially settle obligations of one of our qualified defined benefit pension plans and we recorded a non-cash 
pre-tax charge of $20.0 million. In addition, changes in retiree medical coverage for certain employees covered by the USW 
master agreement resulted in the recognition of an $8.5 million pre-tax curtailment gain. These two items netted to an $11.5 
million pre-tax charge. In fiscal 2014, we completed the first phase of our previously announced lump sum pension settlement 
to certain eligible former employees and recorded a pre-tax charge of $47.9 million. See “Note 15. Retirement Plans” of the 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 

29

(3)  Due to the accelerated monetization strategy in our Land and Development segment, we recorded a pre-tax non-cash real 
estate  impairment  of  $46.7  million,  or  $39.7  million  net  of  $7.0  million  of  noncontrolling  interest,  in  fiscal  2017. The 
impairment was recorded to write-down the carrying value on projects where the projected sales proceeds were less than the 
carrying value. 
 

(4)  On April 6, 2017, we completed the HH&B Sale. In fiscal 2017, we recorded a pre-tax gain on sale of HH&B of $192.8 
million. See “Note 8. Assets Held For Sale” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

(5) 

Income  from  continuing  operations  was  impacted  by  the  HH&B  Sale,  restructuring  and  other  costs,  net,  the  Land  and 
Development impairment, the pension lump sum settlements and pension risk transfer as identified in the table above for the 
respective years. In addition, income from continuing operations in fiscal 2017 was reduced by $26.5 million pre-tax for the 
expensing of inventory stepped-up in purchase accounting, primarily related to the MPS Acquisition, and fiscal 2015 was 
reduced by $64.7 million pre-tax for the expensing of inventory stepped-up in purchase accounting, primarily related to the 
Combination. Income from continuing operations in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 was increased as a result of a reduction of 
cost of goods sold of $6.7 million, $32.3 million and $12.2 million pre-tax, respectively, due to the recording of additional 
value of spare parts at our containerboard mills acquired in the Smurfit-Stone Acquisition. Income from continuing operations 
in fiscal 2013 was increased by the reversal of $254.1 million of tax reserves related to AFMC acquired in the Smurfit-Stone 
Acquisition that were partially offset by a resulting increase in a state tax valuation allowance of $1.2 million. 
 

(6)  Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax in fiscal 2016 included a $478.3 million pre-tax goodwill impairment charge 
and $101.1 million pre-tax customer list impairment charge associated with our former Specialty Chemicals operations. See 
“Note 7. Discontinued Operations” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Income 
from discontinued operations, net of tax in fiscal 2015 was reduced by $8.2 million pre-tax for the expensing of inventory 
stepped-up in purchase accounting, net of related LIFO impact.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF 
OPERATIONS

Item 7. 

Overview

We are a multinational provider of paper and packaging solutions for consumer and corrugated packaging markets. We partner 
with our customers to provide differentiated paper and packaging solutions that help them win in the marketplace. Our team 
members support customers around the world from our operating and business locations in North America, South America, Europe, 
Asia and Australia. We also sell real estate primarily in the Charleston, SC region. 

Organization

WestRock was formed on March 6, 2015 for the purpose of effecting the Combination and, prior to the Combination, did not 
conduct any activities other than those incidental to its formation and the matters contemplated by the Business Combination 
Agreement. On July 1, 2015, pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, RockTenn and MWV completed a strategic 
combination of their respective businesses and RockTenn and MWV each became wholly-owned subsidiaries of WestRock. 
RockTenn was the accounting acquirer in the Combination; therefore, the historical consolidated financial statements of RockTenn 
for periods prior to the Combination are considered to be the historical financial statements of WestRock and thus WestRock’s 
consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2015 reflect RockTenn’s consolidated financial statements for periods from October 
1, 2014 through June 30, 2015, and WestRock’s thereafter. We believe the Combination combined two industry leaders to create 
a leading global provider of consumer and corrugated packaging solutions. See “Note 6. Merger, Acquisitions and Investment” 
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

On May 15, 2016, WestRock completed the Separation, pursuant to which we disposed of our former Specialty Chemicals 
segment in its entirety and ceased to consolidate its assets, liabilities and results of operations in our consolidated financial 
statements. Accordingly, we have presented the financial position and results of operations of our former Specialty Chemicals 
segment as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. See “Note 
7. Discontinued Operations” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

On April 6, 2017, we completed the HH&B Sale. We recorded a pre-tax gain on sale of HH&B of $192.8 million in fiscal 
2017. We used the proceeds from the HH&B Sale in connection with the of MPS Acquisition. See “Note 8. Assets Held For Sale” 
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

30

On June 6, 2017, we completed the MPS Acquisition. MPS is reported in our Consumer Packaging segment. See “Note 6. 

Merger, Acquisitions and Investment” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Presentation

We report our financial results of operations in three reportable segments: Corrugated Packaging, which consists of our 
containerboard mill and corrugated packaging operations, as well as our recycling operations; Consumer Packaging, which consists 
of consumer mills, folding carton, beverage, merchandising displays, home, health and beauty dispensing (prior to the HH&B 
Sale), and partition operations; and Land and Development, which sells real estate, primarily in the Charleston, SC region. In 
fiscal 2016, we reclassified prior period segment results to align to these segments for all periods presented. Following the 
Combination and until the completion of the Separation, our financial results of operations had a fourth reportable segment, 
Specialty Chemicals.

Business

We completed a number of acquisitions in fiscal 2017 that expanded our product and geographic scope (notably the MPS 
Acquisition) or allowed us to increase our integration levels (primarily in the case of the MPS Acquisition, the U.S. Corrugated 
Acquisition, the Island Container Acquisition and the Star Pizza Acquisition), and we expect to continue to evaluate similar potential 
acquisitions in fiscal 2018.

In fiscal 2017, we continued to pursue our strategy of offering differentiated paper and packaging solutions that help our 
customers win. We successfully executed this strategy in fiscal 2017 in a rapidly changing cost and price environment. Net sales 
of $14,859.7 million in fiscal 2017 increased $687.9 million, or 4.9%, compared to fiscal 2016. The increase was primarily a result 
of an increase in Corrugated Packaging segment net sales, including the partial period impact of the U.S. Corrugated Acquisition 
and the Island Container Acquisition, an increase in Land and Development segment net sales due to the accelerated monetization 
strategy and a net increase in the Consumer Packaging segment net sales associated with the MPS Acquisition and the Hannapak 
Acquisition, partially offset by factors that included the absence of full year net sales from HH&B due to the sale of HH&B. 
Segment income decreased $32.7 million in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to the decrease in segment income 
in the Consumer Packaging segment, including the $10.2 million negative impact of the HH&B Sale and the expensing of $25.1 
million acquisition inventory stepped-up in purchase accounting, net of related LIFO primarily related to the MPS Acquisition, 
partially offset by increased segment income in the Corrugated Packaging and Land and Development segments.

Our Corrugated Packaging segment increased its net sales by $539.8 million in fiscal 2017 from $7,868.5 million in fiscal 
2016 to $8,408.3 million in fiscal 2017 primarily due to higher corrugated selling price/mix, higher net sales of our recycling 
operations, primarily due to higher recycled fiber prices, higher corrugated volumes, and favorable foreign currency impacts. The 
segment benefited from strong supply and demand fundamentals in fiscal 2017. North American box shipments increased 4.1% 
on a per day basis in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. Segment income attributable to the Corrugated Packaging segment in 
fiscal 2017 increased $14.0 million to $753.9 million compared to segment income of $739.9 million in fiscal 2016. The increase 
was primarily due to favorable selling price/mix, synergy and productivity improvements, and volumes exceeding the impact of 
higher inflation and the impact of several hurricanes and legal charges.

Our Consumer Packaging segment increased its net sales by $64.4 million in fiscal 2017 from $6,388.1 million in fiscal 2016
to $6,452.5 million in fiscal 2017, primarily as a result of net sales from the MPS Acquisition, the full year impact of the Packaging 
Acquisition and the Hannapak Acquisition, which were largely offset by lower volumes excluding acquisitions, a decrease in net 
sales related to the HH&B Sale and unfavorable selling price/mix. Segment income attributable to the Consumer Packaging 
segment in fiscal 2017 decreased $55.9 million compared to fiscal 2016, primarily as synergy and productivity improvements 
were more than offset by cost inflation, the impact of lower volumes, the impact from the HH&B Sale as compared to the full 
year in fiscal 2016, the impact of the expensing inventory stepped-up in purchase accounting primarily related to the MPS 
Acquisition, and the impact of several hurricanes.

Our Land and Development segment increased its net sales by $124.0 million in fiscal 2017 from $119.8 million in fiscal 
2016 to $243.8 million in fiscal 2017, primarily due to the execution of the accelerated monetization strategy. We expect to complete 
the monetization of our portfolio by the end of fiscal 2018. Segment income attributable to the Land and Development segment 
was $13.8 million in fiscal 2017 compared to $4.6 million in fiscal 2016.

We generated $1,900.5 million of net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2017, compared to $1,688.4 million in 
fiscal 2016, and remained committed to our disciplined capital allocation strategy during fiscal 2017 by investing $778.6 million
in capital expenditures while returning $93.0 million to our stockholders in share repurchases and $403.2 million in dividends. 
We believe our strong balance sheet and cash flow provide us the flexibility to continue to invest to sustain and improve our 
operating performance. In fiscal 2018, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $1.0 billion, of which approximately 
$0.2 billion will be deployed in connection with planned investments in a new corrugated box plant in the Brazilian state of Sao 
Paulo, in a project to install a 330” state-of-the-art kraft linerboard machine in our Florence, South Carolina mill and in a coater 
at our Mahrt mill in Alabama. Excluding these three projects, we expect that approximately 50% of our capital expenditures in 
fiscal 2018 will be for maintenance and replacement projects and approximately 50% will be for return-generating projects.  See 
“Liquidity and Capital Resources” for more information. 

A detailed review of our fiscal 2017 performance appears below under “Results of Operations (Consolidated)”.

Non-GAAP Measures

We report our financial results in accordance with GAAP. However, we have included financial measures that were not 
prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, 
our GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial measures we present may differ from similarly captioned measures of other companies. 

We use the non-GAAP financial measures “Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations” and “Adjusted Earnings from 
Continuing Operations Per Diluted Share”. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide our board of 
directors, investors, potential investors, securities analysts and others with useful information to evaluate our performance because 
the measures exclude restructuring and other costs, net, and other specific items that management believes are not indicative of 
ongoing operating results. We and our board of directors use this information to evaluate our performance relative to other periods. 
We believe that the most directly comparable GAAP measures to Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations and Adjusted 
Earnings from Continuing Operations Per Diluted Share are Income from continuing operations and Earnings from continuing 
operations per diluted share, respectively. The GAAP results in the tables below for Pre-Tax, Tax and Net of Tax are equivalent 
to the line items “Income from continuing operations before income taxes”, “Income tax expense” and “Income from continuing 
operations”, respectively, as reported on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.77 in fiscal 2017 compared to $0.59 in fiscal 2016 and $2.87
in fiscal 2015. Adjusted Earnings from Continuing Operations Per Diluted Share were $2.62, $2.52 and $3.76 in fiscal 2017, 2016 
and 2015, respectively. 

Set forth below is a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure Adjusted Earnings from Continuing Operations Per 
Diluted Share to Earnings from continuing operations per diluted share, the most directly comparable GAAP measure (in dollars 
per share) for the periods indicated.

In fiscal 2017, we excluded the benefit of ceasing recording depreciation and amortization expense while HH&B was held 
for sale. Due to the accelerated monetization strategy, we excluded results from the Land and Development segment in all periods 
presented, including the $46.7 million pre-tax non-cash impairment in fiscal 2017. The impairment was recorded to write-down 
the carrying value on projects where the projected sales proceeds were less than the carrying value. The adjustment to remove the 
favorable impact of certain federal, state and foreign tax items in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to the favorable resolution of items 
that management believed were not indicative of ongoing operating results, including the reduction of a state deferred tax liability 
as a result of an internal U.S. legal entity restructuring. See “Note 8. Assets Held For Sale”, “Note 9. Restructuring and Other 
Costs, Net” and “Note 15. Retirement Plans” for more information.

Net Sales (Unaffiliated Customers)

Net sales for fiscal 2017 increased $687.9 million to $14,859.7 million compared to $14,171.8 million in fiscal 2016. The 
increase was primarily a result of an increase in Corrugated Packaging segment net sales, including the partial period impact of 
the U.S. Corrugated Acquisition and the Island Container Acquisition, an increase in Land and Development segment net sales 
due to the accelerated monetization strategy and a net increase in the Consumer Packaging segment net sales associated with the 
MPS Acquisition and the Hannapak Acquisition, partially offset by factors that included the absence of full year net sales from 
HH&B due to the sale of HH&B. 

Net sales for fiscal 2016 increased $3,047.0 million to $14,171.8 million compared to $11,124.8 million in fiscal 2015 primarily 
as a result of the full year impact of the Combination in fiscal 2016 results, compared to three months in fiscal 2015, and the impact 
of the SP Fiber Acquisition and the Packaging Acquisition completed in fiscal 2016. The increase in net sales attributable to the 
facilities received in the Combination and the noted acquisitions compared to fiscal 2015 were $3,365.7 million. Excluding these 
transactions, net sales decreased due to an estimated $169.6 million of lower selling price/mix and lower volume of $149.1 million.

The change in net sales by segment is outlined in the “Results of Operations — Segment Data” section below.

Cost of Goods Sold

Cost of goods sold increased to $12,119.5 million in fiscal 2017 compared to $11,413.2 million in fiscal 2016. Cost of goods 
sold as a percentage of net sales was 81.6% in fiscal 2017 compared to 80.5% in fiscal 2016 primarily due to cost inflation, 
primarily recycled fiber, as well as increased land sales due to the accelerated monetization strategy and the net impact of acquisitions 
offset by the HH&B Sale and other items. In addition, fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was negatively impacted by the several 
hurricanes. These factors were partially offset by synergy and productivity improvements. Fiscal 2017 and 2016 included $26.5 
million and $8.1 million for the expensing of inventory stepped-up in purchase accounting, net of related LIFO impact, respectively. 

Cost of goods sold increased to $11,413.2 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $8,986.5 million in fiscal 2015. Cost of goods 
sold as a percentage of net sales was 80.5% in fiscal 2016 compared to 80.8% in fiscal 2015 due to increased synergies and 
performance improvements, and lower energy costs, which were largely offset by the impact of lower selling prices in fiscal 2016. 
On a volume adjusted basis, excluding the impact of the Combination, the SP Fiber Acquisition and the Packaging Acquisition, 
energy costs decreased $85.6 million, commodity costs decreased $41.3 million, shipping and warehousing costs decreased $41.3 
million and aggregate depreciation and amortization increased $5.2 million. Fiscal 2016 and 2015 included $8.1 million and $64.7 
million of expense for inventory stepped-up in purchase accounting, net of related LIFO impact, respectively. Fiscal 2016 included 

35

an $8.7 million gain on the sale of a portion of the land at our Panama City, Florida mill to the port authority which was more than 
offset by the $10.0 million estimated impact of major maintenance outage at our Stevenson, Alabama mill. Fiscal 2015 included 
a  reduction  of  cost  of  goods  sold  of  $6.7  million  pre-tax  related  to  the  recording  of  additional  value  of  spare  parts  at  our 
containerboard mills acquired in the Smurfit-Stone Acquisition.

We discuss these items in greater detail below in “Results of Operations (Segment Data)”.

Selling, General and Administrative Excluding Intangible Amortization

SG&A excluding intangible amortization increased $20.2 million to $1,399.6 million in fiscal 2017 compared to $1,379.4 
million in fiscal 2016, due primarily to acquisitions. SG&A excluding intangible amortization as a percentage of sales decreased 
slightly to 9.4% in fiscal 2017 compared to 9.7% in fiscal 2016. 

SG&A excluding intangible amortization increased $364.8 million to $1,379.4 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $1,014.6 
million in fiscal 2015, primarily due to the full year impact of the Combination in fiscal 2016 results compared to three months 
in fiscal 2015, and the impact of the SP Fiber Acquisition and the Packaging Acquisition completed in fiscal 2016. SG&A, excluding 
intangible amortization as a percentage of sales increased slightly to 9.7% in fiscal 2016 compared to 9.1% in fiscal 2015. 

Selling, General and Administrative Intangible Amortization

SG&A  intangible  amortization  was  $229.6  million,  $211.8  million  and  $118.9  million  in  fiscal  2017,  2016  and  2015, 
respectively. The increase in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was due to the fiscal 2017 acquisitions, as well as the full year 
impact of the Packaging Acquisition compared to nine months in fiscal 2016, which were partially offset by the impact of the 
HH&B Sale. The increase in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to the full year inclusion of intangible amortization related to the 
Combination in fiscal 2016 results, compared to three months in fiscal 2015, as well as the full year impact of the SP Fiber 
Acquisition and partial year impact of the Packaging Acquisition completed in fiscal 2016.

Pension Risk Transfer Expense

In fiscal 2016, we used plan assets to settle $2.5 billion of pension obligations of the Plan by purchasing group annuity contracts 
from Prudential. This transaction transferred payment responsibility to Prudential for retirement benefits owed to approximately 
35,000 U.S. retirees and their beneficiaries. As a result, we recorded a non-cash charge of $370.7 million pre-tax. The settlement 
reduced WestRock’s overall U.S. pension obligations and assets by approximately 40%. The monthly retirement benefit payment 
amounts currently received by retirees and their beneficiaries did not change as a result of this transaction. Those plan participants 
not included in the transaction remain in the Plan, and responsibility for payment of their retirement benefits remains with WestRock. 
See “Note 15. Retirement Plans” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Pension Lump Sum Settlement Expense and Retiree Medical Curtailment, Net

In fiscal 2017, lump sum payments to certain beneficiaries of the Plan, together with several one-time severance benefit 
payments out of the Plan, triggered pension settlement accounting and resulted in a $32.6 million non-cash charge to our earnings. 
The lump sum payments were to certain eligible former employees who were not currently receiving a monthly benefit. Eligible 
former employees whose present value of future pension benefits exceeded a certain minimum threshold had the option to either 
voluntarily accept lump sum payments or to not accept the offer and continue to be entitled to their monthly benefit upon retirement.

In fiscal 2015, we partially settled obligations of one of our qualified defined benefit pension plans through lump sum payments 
to certain eligible former employees and as a result recorded a pre-tax charge of $20.0 million. In addition, changes in retiree 
medical coverage for certain employees covered by the USW master agreement resulted in the recognition of an $8.5 million pre-
tax curtailment gain. These two items netted to an $11.5 million pre-tax charge.

See “Note 15. Retirement Plans” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 

Land and Development Impairment

Due to the accelerated monetization strategy in our Land and Development segment, we recorded a pre-tax non-cash real 
estate impairment of $46.7 million, or $39.7 million net of $7.0 million of noncontrolling interest, in fiscal 2017. The impairment 
was recorded to write-down the carrying value on projects where the projected sales proceeds were less than the carrying value. 
The charge is not reflected in segment income.

36

Restructuring and Other Costs, Net

We recorded aggregate pre-tax restructuring and other costs of $196.7 million, $366.4 million and $140.8 million for fiscal 
2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We generally expect the integration of the closed facility’s assets and production with other 
facilities to enable the receiving facilities to better leverage their fixed costs while eliminating fixed costs from the closed facility. 
Costs recorded in each period are not comparable since the timing and scope of the individual actions vary. The restructuring and 
other costs, net, exclude the Specialty Chemicals costs which are included in discontinued operations. See “Note 9. Restructuring 
and Other Costs, Net” and “Note 7. Discontinued Operations” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional 
information. We have restructured portions of our operations from time to time and it is possible that we may engage in additional 
restructuring opportunities in the future. 

Mergers, Acquisitions and Investment

On August 1, 2017, we completed the Hannapak Acquisition in a stock purchase. Hanna Group is one of Australia’s leading 
providers of folding cartons to a variety of markets, including beverage, food, confectionery and healthcare. We expect this 
acquisition will build on our established and growing packaging business in the region. We have included the financial results of 
Hanna Group since the date of the acquisition in our Consumer Packaging segment.

On July 17, 2017, we completed the Island Container Acquisition in an asset purchase. The assets acquired include a corrugator 
and  corrugated  converting  operations  located  in Wheatley  Heights,  New York,  and  certain  related  fulfillment  assets  located 
in Saddle Brook, New Jersey. We expect this acquisition will enable us to integrate more than 80,000 tons of containerboard 
annually into our Corrugated Packaging segment. We have included the financial results of Island Container since the date of the 
acquisition in our Corrugated Packaging segment.

On June 9, 2017, we completed the U.S. Corrugated Acquisition in a stock purchase. We acquired five corrugated converting 
facilities in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Louisiana, which provide a comprehensive suite of products and services to customers in a 
variety of end markets, including food & beverage, pharmaceuticals and consumer electronics. We believe this acquisition will 
enable us to increase the vertical integration of our Corrugated Packaging segment by approximately 105,000 tons of containerboard 
annually through the acquired facilities and another 50,000 tons under a long-term supply contract with another company owned 
by the seller. We have included the financial results of U.S. Corrugated since the date of the acquisition in our Corrugated Packaging 
segment.

On June 6, 2017, we completed the MPS Acquisition in a stock purchase. MPS is a global provider of print-based specialty 
packaging solutions and its differentiated product offering includes premium folding cartons, inserts, labels and rigid packaging. 
We acquired the outstanding shares of MPS for $18.00 per share in cash and the assumption of debt. We believe this acquisition 
increases annual paperboard consumption by approximately 225,000 tons, of which we expect 35% to 45% to be supplied by us. 
We have included the financial results of MPS since the date of the acquisition in our Consumer Packaging segment.

On March 13, 2017, we completed the Star Pizza Acquisition. We believe this acquisition provides us with a leadership position 
in the fast growing small-run pizza box market and increases our vertical integration. We have included the financial results of 
the acquired assets since the date of the acquisition in our Corrugated Packaging segment.

On April 1, 2016, we completed the formation of a joint venture with Grupo Gondi to combine our respective operations in 
Mexico. We contributed cash and the stock of an entity that owns three corrugated packaging facilities in Mexico in return for a 
25.0% equity participation in the joint venture together with future put and call rights. The joint venture operates paper machines, 
corrugated packaging and high graphic folding carton facilities across various production sites. The majority equity holders of 
Grupo Gondi manage the joint venture and we provide technical and commercial resources. We believe the joint venture will help 
grow our presence in the attractive Mexican market. We have included the financial results of the joint venture since the date of 
formation in our Corrugated Packaging segment, and are accounting for the investment on the equity method. In fiscal 2017, the 
joint venture entity had a stock redemption from a minority partner. As a result, our equity participation in the joint venture increased 
to approximately 27.0%. The transaction continues to include future put and call rights with respect to the respective parties’ 
ownership interest in the joint venture. See “Note 23. Subsequent Events (Unaudited) — Grupo Gondi Investment” of the Notes 
to Consolidated Financial Statements for recent developments.

On January 19, 2016, we completed the Packaging Acquisition. The entities acquired provide value-added folding carton and 
litho-laminated  display  packaging  solutions. We  believe  the  transaction  has  provided  us  with  attractive  and  complementary 
customers, markets and facilities. We have included the financial results of the acquired entities since the date of the acquisition 
in our Consumer Packaging segment. 

On October 1, 2015, we completed the SP Fiber Acquisition. The transaction included the acquisition of mills located in Dublin, 
GA and Newberg, OR, which produce lightweight recycled containerboard and kraft and bag paper. The Newberg mill also produced 
newsprint. As part of the transaction, we also acquired SP Fiber's 48% interest in GPS, which we consolidate. GPS is a renewable 
energy joint venture providing steam to the Dublin mill and electricity to Georgia Power. The Dublin mill has helped balance the 
fiber mix of our mill system and the addition of kraft and bag paper has diversified our product offering including our ability to 
serve the increasing demand for lighter weight containerboard. Subsequent to the transaction, we announced the permanent closure 
of the Newberg mill due to the decline in market conditions of the newsprint business and our need to balance supply and demand 
in our containerboard system. We have included the financial results of SP Fiber and GPS since the date of the acquisition in our 
Corrugated Packaging segment. 

On July 1, 2015, pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, RockTenn and MWV completed a strategic combination 
of their respective businesses. Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, RockTenn and MWV each became wholly-
owned subsidiaries of WestRock. RockTenn was the accounting acquirer in the Combination. We believe the Combination combined 
two industry leaders that created a leading global provider of consumer and corrugated packaging solutions. 

See  “Note  6.  Merger, Acquisitions  and  Investment”  of  the  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  for  additional 
information. See also Item 1A. “Risk Factors — We May Be Unsuccessful in Making and Integrating Mergers, Acquisitions 
and Investments and Completing Divestitures”.

Interest Expense

Interest expense was $277.7 million, $256.7 million and $132.5 million for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The 
increase in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to debt incurred as a result of acquisitions, and the increase 
in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to the full year impact of debt assumed in the Combination in fiscal 
2016 results. Interest expense in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 was reduced by $34.5 million, $44.5 million and $10.3 million, 
respectively related to the amortization of the fair value of debt stepped-up in purchase accounting. During fiscal 2017, 2016 and 
2015 amortization of debt issuance costs charged to interest expense were $4.5 million, $4.6 million and $9.3 million, respectively. 
See Item 1A. “Risk Factors — Interest Rate Increases Could Impact Our Financial Condition”.

Provision for Income Taxes

We recorded income tax expense from continuing operations of $159.0 million, at an effective tax rate of 18.5% in fiscal 
2017, as compared to income tax expense from continuing operations of $89.8 million, at an effective tax rate of 36.7% in fiscal 
2016, and compared to an income tax expense from continuing operations of $233.0 million, at an effective tax rate expense of 
31.7% in fiscal 2015. 

The effective tax rate from continuing operations for fiscal 2017 was different than the statutory rate primarily due to (a) low 
rates of tax applicable to the HH&B Sale, (b) a $28.7 million tax benefit related to the reduction of a state deferred tax liability 
as a result of an internal U.S. legal entity restructuring that simplified future operating activities within the U.S., (c) favorable tax 
items, such as the domestic manufacturer’s deduction, (d) lower tax rates applied to foreign earnings, primarily in Canada, and 
(e) a change in valuation allowance due to realization of capital loss carryforward, partially offset by (f) the exclusion of tax 
benefits related to losses recorded by certain foreign operations and (g) the inclusion of state taxes.

The effective tax rate from continuing operations for fiscal 2016 was different than the statutory rate primarily due to (a) the 
impact  of  state  taxes,  (b)  the  ability  to  claim  the  domestic  manufacturer’s  deduction  against  U.S.  taxable  earnings,  (c)  the 
deconsolidation  of  a  subsidiary  related  to  the  Grupo  Gondi  joint  venture,  including  non-deductible  goodwill  disposed  of  in 
connection with the transaction, and (d) an increase in valuation allowances and a tax rate differential with respect to foreign 
earnings primarily in Canada.

See “Note 14. Income Taxes” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Interest Income and Other Income (Expense), net

Interest income and other income (expense), net increased to income of $66.7 million in fiscal 2017 from income of $58.6 
million in fiscal 2016 and $9.7 million in fiscal 2015. The increase in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to an increase in interest rates. 
The increase in fiscal 2016 primarily included a $12.1 million gain on investment in Grupo Gondi related to the three corrugated 
box plants WestRock contributed to the joint venture and an increase in interest income of $30.3 million. The increase in interest 
income in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily the result of the full year impact of a long-term note receivable 
acquired in the Combination. See “Note 20. Special Purpose Entities” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for 
additional information.

Gain on Sale of HH&B

On April 6, 2017, we completed the HH&B Sale. In fiscal 2017, we recorded a pre-tax gain on sale of $192.8 million. We 
used the proceeds from the HH&B Sale in connection with the MPS Acquisition. See “Note 8. Assets Held For Sale” of the Notes 
to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

(Loss) Income from Discontinued Operations

On May 15, 2016, we completed the Separation. Subsequent to the Separation, the operating results of our former Specialty 
Chemicals segment are reported as discontinued operations. Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $544.7 million
for fiscal 2016 and income from discontinued operations was $10.6 million in fiscal 2015. The loss in fiscal 2016 was the result 
of goodwill and intangible impairments, and restructuring and other costs being partially offset by income from operations.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2016, in light of changing market conditions, expected revenue and earnings of the reporting unit, 
lower comparative market valuations for companies in Specialty Chemicals’ peer group and the results of our preliminary “Step 
2” test, we concluded that an impairment of the Specialty Chemicals reporting unit was probable and could be reasonably estimated. 
As a result, we recorded a pre-tax and after-tax non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $478.3 million. In the third quarter of 
fiscal 2016, in conjunction with the Separation, we performed an impairment assessment under the held for sale model and recorded 
a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of $101.1 million for a customer relationships intangible. See “Note 7. Discontinued 
Operations” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Results of Operations — Segment Data

RockTenn was the accounting acquirer in the Combination; therefore, the historical consolidated financial statements of 
RockTenn for periods prior to the Combination are considered to be the historical financial statements of WestRock and thus 
WestRock’s consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2015 reflect RockTenn’s consolidated financial statements for periods 
from October 1, 2014 through June 30, 2015, and WestRock’s thereafter. Our financial results of operations are aligned in three 
reportable segments: Corrugated Packaging, Consumer Packaging and Land and Development. 

Corrugated Packaging Segment

North American Corrugated Packaging Shipments

Corrugated Packaging Shipments are expressed as a tons equivalent, which includes external and intersegment tons shipped 
from our Corrugated Packaging mills plus Corrugated Packaging container shipments converted from BSF to tons. We have 
presented the Corrugated Packaging Shipments in two groups following the Combination: North America and Brazil / India. We 
have separated Brazil/India because we believe investors, potential investors, securities analysts and others find this presentation 
useful when evaluation our operating performance. We have included the impact of the Combination beginning in the fourth 
quarter of fiscal 2015. We have recast the North American Corrugated Container Shipments in the table below prior to April 1, 
2016 to remove the historical impact of the three box plants contributed to the Grupo Gondi joint venture to provide comparability 
to the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2016 and future results.

(1) Net Sales before intersegment eliminations

Net Sales (Aggregate) — Corrugated Packaging Segment

Net sales before intersegment eliminations for the Corrugated Packaging segment increased $539.8 million in fiscal 2017
compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to $321.8 million of higher corrugated selling price/mix, $143.9 million of higher net sales 
of our recycling operations, primarily due to higher recycled fiber prices, $98.2 million of higher corrugated volumes, including 
acquisitions, and $55.9 million of favorable foreign currency impacts. These increases were partially offset by an estimated $45.0 
million decrease due to the impact of several hurricanes in fiscal 2017 and a net $42.2 million of lower corrugated net sales due 
to a shift in sales from converted boxes in the prior year period to sales of containerboard in fiscal 2017 as a result of having 
contributed three box plants to the Grupo Gondi joint venture in April 2016.

Net sales before intersegment eliminations for the Corrugated Packaging segment increased $351.6 million in fiscal 2016 
compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to $565.4 million of incremental net sales from the full year impact of facilities acquired 
in the Combination in fiscal 2016 results, compared to three months in fiscal 2015, the impact of the SP Fiber Acquisition in fiscal 
2016 and $57.8 million of lower recycled fiber sales due to lower selling price/mix. These increases were partially offset by the 
impact of an estimated $178.2 million of lower corrugated selling price/mix and $93.4 million of lower volumes excluding these 
transactions. The lower corrugated selling price/mix was primarily the result of previously published index reductions. Corrugated 
Packaging shipments in North America increased 4.6% in fiscal 2016 compared to the prior year, inclusive of the SP Fiber 
Acquisition.

Segment Income — Corrugated Packaging Segment

Segment income attributable to the Corrugated Packaging segment in fiscal 2017 increased $14.0 million to $753.9 million
compared to segment income of $739.9 million in fiscal 2016. The increase was primarily due to an estimated $285.4 million of 
favorable selling price/mix, $154.4 million of synergy and productivity improvements and $21.0 million of favorable corrugated 
volumes, including acquisitions. These factors were largely offset by an estimated $380.0 million of cost inflation, the impact of 
several hurricanes and legal charges that reduced segment income by an estimated $40.4 million and higher depreciation and 
amortization of $18.3 million. The primary inflation resulted from materials, energy, freight, and wage and other costs. These 
items consisted primarily of $220.9 million of recycled fiber costs, $61.7 million of energy costs, $25.4 million of chemical costs, 
$21.8 million of freight costs and $62.2 million of wage and other costs, which were partially offset by $30.8 million of lower 
virgin fiber costs.

Segment income attributable to the Corrugated Packaging segment in fiscal 2016 decreased $66.8 million to $739.9 million
compared to segment income of $806.7 million in fiscal 2015. The decrease in segment income was primarily a result of lower 
selling price/mix and volume that were partially offset by synergies and productivity improvements, lower energy and commodity 
costs, and lower aggregate freight, shipping and warehousing costs. The estimated impact of lower selling price/mix was $178.2 
million and the estimated impact of lower volume was $37.1 million compared to the prior year. Excluding the Combination and 
the SP Fiber Acquisition, on a volume adjusted basis compared to the prior year, energy costs decreased $73.2 million, commodity 
costs decreased $35.0 million, aggregate freight, shipping and warehousing costs decreased $46.7 million, and depreciation and 
amortization expense increased $7.3 million. Segment income was also reduced by $3.4 million and $2.2 million of expense for 
inventory stepped-up in purchase accounting, net of related LIFO impact in fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. Segment income 
in fiscal 2016 included an $8.7 million gain on the sale of a portion of the land at our Panama City, Florida mill to the port authority, 
which was more than offset by the $10.0 million estimated impact of a major maintenance outage at our Stevenson, Alabama mill. 
Segment income in fiscal 2015 included a reduction of cost of goods sold of $6.7 million related to the recording of additional 
value of spare parts at our containerboard mills acquired in the Smurfit-Stone Acquisition.

Consumer Packaging Segment

Consumer Packaging Shipments

Consumer Packaging Shipments are expressed as a tons equivalent, which includes external and intersegment tons shipped 
from our Consumer Packaging mills plus Consumer Packaging converting shipments converted from BSF to tons. The shipment 
data table excludes merchandising displays and dispensing sales (prior to the closing of the HH&B Sale on April 6, 2017) since 
there is not a common unit of measure, as well as gypsum paperboard liner tons produced by Seven Hills since it is not consolidated. 
We have included the impact of the Combination beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.

Net sales before intersegment eliminations for the Consumer Packaging segment increased $64.4 million in fiscal 2017
compared to fiscal 2016 primarily as a result $575.1 million of net sales from the MPS Acquisition, the Packaging Acquisition 
and the Hannapak Acquisition, which were largely offset by $188.5 million of lower volumes, a $276.8 million decrease in net 
sales related to an absence of net sales from HH&B since April 2017 due to the HH&B Sale, $26.1 million of unfavorable selling 
price/mix and an estimated $20.0 million decrease due to the impact of several hurricanes in fiscal 2017.

Net sales before intersegment eliminations for the Consumer Packaging segment increased $2,648.0 million in fiscal 2016 
compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to $2,748.7 million of incremental net sales from the full year impact of facilities acquired 
in the Combination in fiscal 2016 results, compared to three months in fiscal 2015, and the partial year impact of the Packaging 
Acquisition. Those increased net sales were partially offset by $81.0 million of lower display sales due to softness in customer 
promotional spending, an estimated $8.6 million of higher consumer packaging, excluding display, selling price/mix and $28.3 
million of lower volumes excluding the Combination and the Packaging Acquisition.

Segment Income — Consumer Packaging Segment

Segment income attributable to the Consumer Packaging segment in fiscal 2017 decreased $55.9 million compared to fiscal 
2016, primarily due to an estimated $169.2 million of cost inflation, $50.2 million for the impact of lower volumes, $25.7 million 
impact of lower income from HH&B in fiscal 2017 due to the HH&B Sale as compared to the full year in fiscal 2016, a $20.4 
million increase in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 for the expensing of inventory stepped-up in purchase accounting, primarily 
related to the MPS Acquisition in the current year period and the Packaging Acquisition in the prior year period, an estimated 
$12.2 million related to the impact of several hurricanes in fiscal 2017 and $8.8 million of lower selling price/mix. These factors 
were partially offset by synergy and productivity improvements of an estimated $203.8 million, a $29.4 million contribution from 
the operations acquired in the MPS Acquisition prior to expensing the before mentioned inventory step-up and $15.3 million of 
lower depreciation and amortization expense. The lower depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to a $10.1 
million pre-tax benefit of ceasing recording depreciation and amortization expense in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 in HH&B 
since it was designated as held for sale. The primary inflation resulted from materials, energy, freight, and wage and other costs. 
These items consisted primarily of $42.2 million of recycled fiber costs, $38.6 million of chemical costs, $37.2 million of energy 
costs, $9.2 million of freight costs and $58.5 million of wage and other costs, which were partially offset by $21.5 million of lower 
virgin fiber costs.

Segment income attributable to the Consumer Packaging segment in fiscal 2016 increased $214.7 million compared to fiscal 
2015, primarily reflecting $235.0 million from facilities acquired in the Combination and the Packaging Acquisition, the impact 
of synergy and productivity improvements, and lower energy related costs compared to the prior year partially offset by the impact 
of lower volume and lower selling price/mix. Segment income was reduced by $4.7 million and $62.5 million of expense for 
inventory stepped-up in purchase accounting, net of related LIFO impact in fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. The estimated 
impact of lower volume was $30.9 million and higher selling price/mix was $8.6 million. Excluding the Combination and the 
Packaging Acquisition, on a volume adjusted basis compared to the prior year, commodity costs decreased $6.3 million and energy 
costs decreased $12.3 million.

Net sales for the Land and Development segment in fiscal 2017 were $243.8 million compared to $119.8 million in fiscal 
2016. The increase was a result of the accelerated monetization strategy. We continue to include the remainder of the real estate 

44

holdings in assets held for sale because we have met the held for sale criteria. We expect to complete our monetization program 
in fiscal 2018. Net sales in fiscal 2015 were $45.0 million. 

Segment Income (Loss) — Land and Development Segment

Segment income attributable to the Land and Development segment was $13.8 million in fiscal 2017 compared to $4.6 million
in fiscal 2016 and a loss of $3.4 million in fiscal 2015. The segment’s assets were stepped-up to fair value in fiscal 2015 as a result 
of purchase accounting which resulted in substantially lower margins on the properties sold compared to pre-Combination levels. 
The step-up of our land portfolio in this segment is expected to reduce future profitability on existing projects but should not 
impact future cash flows. The increase in segment income in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to the accelerated monetization strategy. 
The $46.7 million real estate impairment is not included in segment income.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We fund our working capital requirements, capital expenditures, mergers, acquisitions and investments, restructuring and 
integration activities, dividends and stock repurchases from net cash provided by operating activities, borrowings under our credit 
facilities, proceeds from our A/R Sales Agreement, proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment removed from service 
and proceeds received in connection with the issuance of debt and equity securities. Funding for our domestic operations in the 
foreseeable future is expected to come from sources of liquidity within our domestic operations, including cash and cash equivalents, 
and available borrowings under our credit facilities. As such, our foreign cash and cash equivalents are not expected to be a key 
source of liquidity to our domestic operations. Maximum borrowing availability under the credit facilities are governed by certain 
restrictive covenants. We test and report our compliance with these covenants as required and we were in compliance with all of 
our covenants at September 30, 2017. At September 30, 2017, we had $114.6 million of outstanding letters of credit not drawn 
upon. See “Note 11. Debt” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 

Primary Sources of Liquidity

At September 30, 2017, we had approximately $2.9 billion of availability under our committed credit facilities. This liquidity 
may be used to provide for ongoing working capital needs and for other general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, 
dividends and stock repurchases. 

 
•  We have a Credit Facility which we entered into as a 5-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility on July 1, 2015 
for an aggregate committed principal amount of $2.0 billion, of which approximately $1.9 billion has been extended to 
July 1, 2022, with the remainder due on July 1, 2020. At September 30, 2017, we had no amounts outstanding under this 
facility.

•  We have a $700.0 million Receivables Facility. On July 22, 2016, we extended the maturity of this facility to July 22, 
2019. Borrowing availability under this facility is based on the eligible underlying accounts receivable and compliance 
with certain covenants. At September 30, 2017, we had $110.0 million outstanding under this facility.

•  On May 15, 2017, we entered into a $600.0 million European revolving credit facility with Coöperatieve Rabobank U.A., 
New York Branch as the administrative agent for the syndicate of banks. This facility provides for a 364-day unsecured 
Euro and Sterling denominated borrowing of not more than $200.0 million and $400.0 million U.S. dollar equivalent, 
respectively. The facility matures on May 14, 2018. At September 30, 2017, we had $211.6 million outstanding under 
this facility.

•  On December 1, 2015, we entered into a $200.0 million uncommitted and revolving line of credit with Sumitomo Mitsui 
Banking Corporation that matured on December 1, 2016. We renewed the facility on February 10, 2017, and the facility 
now matures on February 12, 2018. At September 30, 2017, we had $106.7 million outstanding under this facility.

•  On March 4, 2016, we entered into a $100.0 million uncommitted and revolving line of credit with Coöperatieve Rabobank 
U.A., New York Branch. The facility matured on March 2, 2017 and was renewed as a Euro dollar facility on the same 
day. The facility is an uncommitted revolving line of credit in the amount of €100.0 million. The facility is available in 
Euros only, and continues until terminated in writing by WestRock or the lender. At September 30, 2017, we had $118.1 
million amounts outstanding under this facility.

See “Note 23. Subsequent Events (Unaudited)” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for recent developments 

regarding liquidity.

Cash  and  cash  equivalents  were  $298.1  million  at  September 30,  2017  and  $340.9  million  at  September 30,  2016. 
Approximately 93% of the cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2017 were held outside of the U.S. At September 30, 2017, 
total debt was $6,554.8 million, $608.7 million of which was current. At September 30, 2016, total debt was $5,789.2 million, 
$292.9 million of which was current. The increase in debt of $765.6 million was primarily related to fiscal 2017 acquisitions net 
of other operational activities and corporate actions.

Net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2017 increased $212.1 million from fiscal 2016 primarily due to a 
$111.6 million net increase in cash flow from working capital changes plus higher after-tax cash proceeds from our Land and 
Development segment’s accelerated monetization strategy. Net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2016 increased 
$484.8 million from fiscal 2015 primarily due to the impact of the Combination and a smaller use for working capital in fiscal 
2016 of $34.8 million as compared to $142.9 million in fiscal 2015. The change in working capital in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015
included a source of cash resulting from the sale of $64.7 million, $99.4 million and $96.2 million, respectively, of accounts 
receivables in connection with the A/R Sales Agreement.

Net cash used for investing activities in fiscal 2017 consisted primarily of $778.6 million of capital expenditures, $1,588.5 
million for the MPS Acquisition, U.S. Corrugated Acquisition, Island Container Acquisition, Hannapak Acquisition and Star Pizza 
Acquisition, partially offset by a $3.5 million receipt of an escrow payment from the Packaging Acquisition and proceeds of 
$1,005.9 million from the HH&B Sale and $52.6 million of proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment. Net cash 
used for investing activities in fiscal 2016 consisted primarily of $796.7 million of capital expenditures, $376.4 million for the 
SP Fiber Acquisition and Packaging Acquisition, $175.0 million for the investment in Grupo Gondi and $36.5 million for the 
purchase of debt owed by GPS in connection with the SP Fiber Acquisition partially offset by $31.2 million of proceeds from the 
sale of property, plant and equipment. Net cash used for investing activities in fiscal 2015 consisted primarily of $585.5 million
of capital expenditures partially offset by $265.7 million for cash received in the Combination and $28.8 million of proceeds from 
the sale of property, plant and equipment. 

 
In fiscal 2017, net cash used for financing activities consisted primarily of cash dividends paid to stockholders of $403.2 
million, net repayments of debt of $145.2 million and purchases of Common Stock of $93.0 million. In fiscal 2016, net cash used 
for financing activities consisted primarily of cash dividends paid to stockholders of $380.7 million, purchases of Common Stock 
of $335.3 million and $105.0 million of cash and trust funding as a result of the Separation, which was partially offset by net 
additions to debt of $617.3 million. See “Note 7. Discontinued Operations” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
for additional information. In fiscal 2015, net cash used for financing activities consisted primarily of $336.7 million used for 
stock repurchases, excluding the $667.8 million repurchased in connection with the Combination, and $214.5 million of cash 
dividends paid to stockholders, partially offset by net additions to debt aggregating $540.1 million. 

Our capital expenditures aggregated $778.6 million in fiscal 2017. With the portfolio changes we have made, we estimate 
our baseline maintenance and return generating capital expenditures will be approximately $800 to $850 million per year. We 
believe we have an opportunity to improve our performance through capital investment. We expect fiscal 2018 capital expenditures 
to be approximately $1.0 billion. In fiscal 2018, we expect to invest in projects (i) to maintain and operate our mills and plants 
safely, reliably and in compliance with regulations, (ii) that support our strategy to improve the competitiveness of our mill and 
converting assets, (iii) to support our $1.0 billion run rate synergy and performance improvement target, before inflation, to be 
realized by June 30, 2018, (iv) to build a new corrugated box plant in the Brazilian state of Sao Paulo to meet growing demand 
from our regional customers in South America to be completed in fiscal 2019, (v) to install a 330” state-of-the-art kraft linerboard 
machine in our Florence, South Carolina mill with production expected to commence in the first half of calendar 2020, (vi) to 
install a coater at our Mahrt coated natural kraft mill to be completed in fiscal 2019, and (vii) to generate attractive returns. 
However, it is possible that our capital expenditure assumptions may change, project completion dates may change, or we may 
decide to invest a different amount depending upon opportunities we identify, changes in market conditions or to comply with 
environmental or other regulation changes. We estimate that we will invest approximately $40 million for capital expenditures 
during fiscal 2018 in connection with matters relating to environmental compliance. We were obligated to purchase approximately 

46

$155 million of fixed assets at September 30, 2017 for various capital projects. See “Note 23. Subsequent Events (Unaudited) 
— Capital Investment in Florence, South Carolina Mill” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. See Item 1A. “Risk 
Factors — Our Capital Expenditures May Not Achieve the Desired Outcomes or May Be Achieved at a Higher Cost than 
Anticipated”.

At September 30, 2017, the U.S. federal, state and foreign net operating losses, alternative minimum tax credits and other 
U.S. federal and state tax credits available to us aggregated approximately $246 million in future potential reductions of U.S. 
federal, state and foreign cash taxes. Based on our current projections, we expect to utilize the remaining U.S. federal net operating 
losses, alternative minimum tax and other U.S. federal credits primarily over the next three years. Foreign and state net operating 
losses and credits will be used over a longer period of time. It is possible that our utilization of these net operating losses and 
credits may change due to changes in taxable income, tax laws or tax rates, capital expenditures or other factors. Subject to changes 
in tax laws, we expect to receive tax benefits in fiscal 2018 and future years from the U.S. manufacturer’s deduction. Including 
the estimated impact of book and tax differences, subject to changes in tax laws, we expect our cash tax rate to move closer to 
our income tax rate in fiscal 2018, 2019 and 2020.

During fiscal 2017 and 2016, we made contributions of $34.5 million and $47.5 million, respectively, to our U.S. and non-
U.S. pension plans. Based on current facts and assumptions, we expect to contribute approximately $39 million to our U.S. and 
non-U.S. pension plans in fiscal 2018, primarily related to our Canadian plans. We have made contributions and expect to continue 
to make contributions in the coming years to our pension plans in order to ensure that our funding levels remain adequate in light 
of projected liabilities and to meet the requirements of the Pension Act and other regulations. The net over funded status of our 
U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans at September 30, 2017 was approximately $78.5 million. Based on current assumptions, including 
future interest rates, we estimate that minimum pension contributions to our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans will be in the range 
of approximately $27 million to $42 million annually in fiscal 2019 through 2022. See “Note 15. Retirement Plans” of the Notes 
to Consolidated Financial Statements. See also Item 1A. “Risk Factors — We May Incur Increased Employee Benefit Costs 
and Certain of Our Pension Plans Will Likely Require Additional Cash Contributions”.

In the normal course of business, we evaluate our potential exposure to MEPPs, including with respect to potential withdrawal 
liabilities. We are considering withdrawing from one or more MEPPs. It is reasonably possible that we may incur significant 
withdrawal liabilities with respect to certain MEPPs in connection with such withdrawal(s). In addition, we may be obligated to 
pay a share of a particular MEPPs accumulated funding deficiency. See “Note 15. Retirement Plans — Multiemployer Plans” 
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. See also Item 1A. “Risk Factors - We May Incur Withdrawal Liability and/
or Increased Funding Requirements in Connection with the MEPPs in Which We Participate”.

In October 2017, our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.43 per share, representing a 7.5% increase from 
the prior $0.40 per share quarterly dividend and an annual dividend of $1.72 per share. During fiscal 2017, we paid an annual 
dividend of $1.60 per share. During fiscal 2016 and 2015, we paid an annual dividend of $1.50 and $1.20 per share, respectively. 

In July 2015, our board of directors authorized a repurchase program of up to 40.0 million shares of our Common Stock, 
representing approximately 15% of our outstanding Common Stock as of July 1, 2015. Shares of our Common Stock may be 
purchased from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions. The timing, manner, price and amount of 
repurchases will be determined by management at its discretion based on factors, including the market price of our Common 
Stock, general economic and market conditions and applicable legal requirements. The repurchase program may be commenced, 
suspended or discontinued at any time. In fiscal 2017, we repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares of our Common Stock 
for an aggregate cost of $93.0 million. In fiscal 2016, we repurchased approximately 8.1 million shares of our Common Stock for 
an  aggregate  cost  of  $335.3  million.  In  the  fourth  quarter  of  fiscal  2015,  subsequent  to  the  authorization,  we  repurchased 
approximately 5.4 million shares of our Common Stock for an aggregate cost of $328.0 million. As of September 30, 2017, we 
had remaining authorization under the repurchase program authorized in July 2015 to purchase approximately 24.7 million shares 
of our Common Stock.

Separately, as part of the Combination, RockTenn repurchased 10.5 million shares of RockTenn common stock for an aggregate 
cost of $667.8 million. Prior to the closing of the Combination and pursuant to the then existing repurchase plan, in the first quarter 
of fiscal 2015, RockTenn repurchased 0.2 million shares of RockTenn common stock for an aggregate cost of $8.7 million. 

We anticipate that we will be able to fund our capital expenditures, interest payments, dividends and stock repurchases, 
pension payments, working capital needs, note repurchases, restructuring and integration activities, repayments of current portion 
of long-term debt and other corporate actions for the foreseeable future from cash generated from operations, borrowings under 
our credit facilities, proceeds from our A/R Sales Agreement, proceeds from the issuance of debt or equity securities or other 
additional long-term debt financing, including new or amended facilities. In addition, we continually review our capital structure 
and conditions in the private and public debt markets in order to optimize our mix of indebtedness. In connection therewith, we 

47

may seek to refinance existing indebtedness to extend maturities, reduce borrowing costs or otherwise improve the terms and 
composition of our indebtedness.

Contractual Obligations

We  summarize  our  enforceable  and  legally  binding  contractual  obligations  at  September 30,  2017,  and  the  effect  these 
obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in the following table. Certain amounts in this 
table are based on management’s estimates and assumptions about these obligations, including their duration, the possibility of 
renewal, anticipated actions by third parties and other factors, including estimated minimum pension plan contributions and 
estimated benefit payments related to postretirement obligations, supplemental retirement plans and deferred compensation plans. 
Because these estimates and assumptions are subjective, the enforceable and legally binding obligations we actually pay in future 
periods may vary from those we have summarized in the table.

(3)  The fair value step-up of $20.6 million is excluded. See “Note 11. Debt” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

for additional information.

(4)  Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that 
specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price 
provision; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without 
penalty.

(5)  We have included in the table future estimated minimum pension plan contributions and estimated benefit payments related 
to postretirement obligations, supplemental retirement plans and deferred compensation plans. Our estimates are based on 
current factors, such as discount rates and expected returns on plan assets. Future contributions are subject to changes in our 
underfunded status based on factors such as investment performance, discount rates, returns on plan assets and changes in 
legislation. It is possible that our assumptions may change, actual market performance may vary or we may decide to 
contribute different amounts.

(6)  We have not included in the table the following items:

•  An item labeled “other long-term liabilities” reflected on our consolidated balance sheet because these other long-

term liabilities do not have a definite pay-out scheme.

•  We have excluded from the line item “Purchase obligations and other” $195.3 million for certain provisions of ASC 
740 “Income Taxes” associated with liabilities for uncertain tax positions due to the uncertainty as to the amount 
and timing of payment, if any. 

48

In addition to the enforceable and legally binding obligations quantified in the table above, we have other obligations for 
goods and services and raw materials entered into in the normal course of business. These contracts, however, are subject to change 
based on our business decisions.

Expenditures for Environmental Compliance

See Item 1. “Business — Governmental Regulation — Environmental and Other Matters” for a discussion of our 

expenditures for environmental compliance.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

We have prepared our accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP, which requires management 
to make estimates that affect the amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities reported. Certain critical accounting matters 
are described in “Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements for additional information. See also Item 7A. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market 
Risk”. These critical accounting matters are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require some 
of management’s most subjective and complex judgments. The accounting for these matters involves the making of estimates 
based on current facts, circumstances and assumptions that, in management’s judgment, could change in a manner that would 
materially affect management’s future estimates with respect to such matters and, accordingly, could cause our future reported 
financial condition and results to differ materially from those that we are currently reporting based on management’s current 
estimates. 

Critical accounting matters discussed in “Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” 
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements include (i) accounts receivable and allowances; (ii) goodwill and long-lived 
assets; (iii) restructuring; (iv) business combinations; (v) fair value of financial instruments and nonfinancial assets and liabilities; 
(vi) accounting for income taxes; and (vii) pension and postretirement benefits.

Accounts Receivable and Allowances

We have an allowance for doubtful accounts, credits, returns and allowances, and cash discounts that serve to reduce the value 
of our gross accounts receivable to the amount we estimate we will ultimately collect. The allowances contain uncertainties because 
the calculation requires management to make assumptions and apply judgment regarding our customers’ credit worthiness and 
the credits, returns and allowances and cash discounts that may be taken by our customers. We perform ongoing evaluations of 
our customers’ financial condition and generally do not require collateral. We adjust credit limits based upon payment history and 
the  particular  customer’s  current  credit  worthiness,  as  determined  by  our  review  of  their  current  financial  information. We 
continuously monitor collections from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our customers’ 
financial condition, our collection experience and any other relevant customer specific information. Our assessment of this and 
other information forms the basis of our allowances. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material 
change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to estimate the allowances. However, while these credit losses have historically 
been within our expectations and the provisions we established, it is possible that our credit loss rates could be higher or lower in 
the future depending on changes in business conditions and changes in our customers’ credit worthiness. At September 30, 2017, 
our accounts receivable, net of allowances of $45.8 million, was $1,886.8 million; a 1% additional loss on accounts receivable 
would change our allowance by $18.9 million and a 5% change in our allowance assumptions would change our allowance by 
$2.3 million.

Goodwill

We review the carrying value of our goodwill annually at the beginning of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more often 
if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed fair value. We determine recoverability by 
comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill applies to the carrying value, including goodwill, 
of that reporting unit using a discounted cash flow model. We also consider the market approach using implied public and private 
multiples. Our discounted cash flow analysis is based on the sum of two components, the present value of our projected cash flows 
and the present value of a terminal value. The cash flow estimates are derived from our current forecast and our long-term forecasts 
prepared for each reporting unit considering historical results and anticipated future performance and capital expenditures, and 
require considerable judgment. The discount rates used to determine the present value of future cash flows were derived from a 
weighted average cost of capital analysis utilizing a beta that is derived from peer companies. In addition, we gave consideration 
in the calculation of the weighted average cost of capital for equity risks including size risk, industry risk and country specific 
risk, as appropriate, for each of our reporting units. As a result of the weighted average cost of capital calculations, our discount 

49

rate used for each reporting unit ranged from 8% to 14%. We use perpetual growth rates in the reporting units ranging from 1.5% 
to 4%. Estimating the fair value of the reporting unit involves uncertainties because it requires management to develop numerous 
assumptions, including assumptions about the future growth and potential volatility in revenues and costs, capital expenditures, 
industry economic factors and future business strategy. The variability of the factors that management uses to perform the goodwill 
impairment test depends on a number of conditions, including uncertainty about future events and cash flows, including anticipated 
changes in revenues and costs and synergies and productivity improvements resulting from the acquisitions, capital expenditures 
and continuous improvement projects. All such factors are interdependent and, therefore, do not change in isolation. Accordingly, 
our accounting estimates may materially change from period to period due to changing market factors. If we had used other 
assumptions and estimates or if different conditions occur in future periods, future operating results could be materially impacted. 
Any significant adverse changes in key assumptions about these businesses and their prospects, such as changes in our strategy 
or products, the loss of key customers, regulatory changes or adverse changes in economic and market conditions may cause a 
change in the estimated fair values of our reporting units and could result in an impairment charge that could be material to our 
financial statements.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, of those reporting units that have goodwill, our Consumer Packaging and Brazil 
Corrugated reporting units had a fair value which exceeded their carrying value by a little more than 10%, due primarily to the 
Combination and the MPS Acquisition and the corresponding fair value accounting. If we had concluded that it was appropriate 
to increase the discount rate we used by 100 basis point to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit that has goodwill, the fair 
value for each of our reporting units would have continued to exceed its carrying value, except for the Consumer Packaging and 
Brazil Corrugated reporting units. The Consumer Packaging and Brazil Corrugated reporting units had $3,586.8 million and $177.3 
million of goodwill at September 30, 2017, respectively. No events have occurred since the latest annual goodwill impairment 
assessment that would necessitate an interim goodwill impairment assessment. We have not made any material changes to our 
impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that 
there will be a material change in future assumptions or estimates we use to calculate impairment losses. However, if actual results 
are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, we may be exposed to impairment losses that could be material.

Accounting for Income Taxes

Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, reflect management’s 
best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within 
the jurisdiction from which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of 
deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent operations. Significant judgments and 
estimates  are  required  in  determining  the  consolidated  income  tax  expense.  We  recognize  interest  and  penalties  related  to 
unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations. A 1% change in our effective tax 
rate would increase or decrease tax expense by approximately $8.6 million for fiscal 2017. A 1% change in our effective tax rate 
used to compute deferred tax liabilities and assets, as recorded on the September 30, 2017 consolidated balance sheet, would 
increase or decrease tax expense by approximately $97.5 million for fiscal 2017.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

The funded status of our qualified and non-qualified U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans increased $159.8 million in fiscal 2017. 
Our U.S. qualified and non-qualified pension plans are over funded $166.0 million and our non-U.S. pension plans are underfunded 
$87.5 million. Our U.S. pension plan obligations were positively impacted in fiscal 2017 by market returns, our pension de-risking 
program and changes in participant demographics. The non-U.S. pension plan obligations were positively impacted in fiscal 2017 
by an 18 basis point increase in the discount rate compared to the prior measurement date. A 25 basis point change in the discount 
rate, compensation level, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets or medical cost trend, factoring in our corridor as 
appropriate, would have had the following effect on fiscal 2017 pension and other postretirement expense (amounts in the table 
in parentheses reflect additional income, in millions):

Item 7A. 

 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to market risk from changes in, among other things, interest rates, foreign currencies and commodity prices. 
We aim to identify and understand these risks and then implement strategies to manage them. When evaluating these strategies, 
we evaluate the fundamentals of each market, our sensitivity to movements in pricing, and underlying accounting and business 
implications. To implement these strategies, we may enter into various hedging transactions. The sensitivity analyses we present 
below do not consider the effect of possible adverse changes in the general economy, nor do they consider additional actions we 
may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes. We may not be successful in managing these risks.

Containerboard and Paperboard Shipments

We are exposed to market risk related to our sales of containerboard and paperboard. We sell a significant portion of our mill 
production and converted products pursuant to contracts that provide that prices are either fixed for specified terms or provide for 
price adjustments based on negotiated terms, including changes in specified index prices. We have the capacity to annually ship 
approximately  9.3  million  tons  in  our  Corrugated  Packaging  segment  and  approximately  4.2  million  tons  in  our  Consumer 
Packaging segment. Although our mill system operating rates may vary from year to year due to changes in market and other 
factors, our simple average mill system operating rates for the last three years averaged 95%. A hypothetical $10 per ton decrease 
in the price of paperboard throughout the year based on our capacity would decrease our sales by approximately $93 million and 
$42 million in our Corrugated Packaging and Consumer Packaging segments, respectively. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors — Our 
Earnings Are Highly Dependent on Volumes”.

Energy 

Energy is one of the most significant costs of our mill operations. The cost of natural gas, coal, oil, electricity and wood by-
products (biomass) at times have fluctuated significantly. In our recycled paperboard mills, we use primarily natural gas and 
electricity, supplemented with coal and fuel oil to generate steam used in the paper making process and, at a few mills, to generate 
electricity used on site. In our virgin fiber mills, we use biomass, natural gas and coal to generate steam used in the pulping and 
paper making processes and to generate some or all of the electricity used on site. We primarily use electricity and natural gas to 
operate our converting facilities. We generally purchase these products from suppliers at market or tariff rates. 

We spent approximately $732 million on all energy sources in fiscal 2017 to operate our facilities. Natural gas accounted for 
approximately two-fifths (approximately 68 million MMBtu) of our total energy purchases in fiscal 2017. A hypothetical 10% 
increase in the price of energy throughout the year would increase our cost of energy by approximately $73 million based on fiscal 
2017 pricing and consumption. 

Recycled Fiber

Recycled fiber is the principal raw material we use in the production of recycled paperboard and a portion of our containerboard. 
We consume approximately 4.9 million tons of recycled fiber per year. Our purchases of old corrugated containers and double-
lined kraft clippings accounted for our largest recycled fiber costs and approximately 85% to 90% of our recycled fiber purchases. 
The remaining 10% to 15% of our recycled fiber purchases consisted of a number of other grades of recycled paper. The mix of 
recycled fiber may vary due to factors such as market demand, availability and pricing. A hypothetical 10% increase in recycled 
fiber prices in our mills for a fiscal year would increase our costs by approximately $96 million. 

Virgin Fiber

Virgin fiber is the principal raw material we use in the production of a portion of our containerboard, bleached paperboard 
and market pulp. A hypothetical 10% increase in virgin fiber prices in our mills for a fiscal year would increase our costs by 
approximately $115 million. 

51

Freight

Inbound and outbound freight is a significant expenditure for us. Factors that influence our freight expense are items such as 
distance between our shipping and delivery locations, distance from customers and suppliers, mode of transportation (rail, truck, 
intermodal and ocean) and freight rates, which are influenced by supply and demand and fuel costs, primarily diesel. A hypothetical 
10% increase for a fiscal year would increase our costs by approximately $128 million, of which approximately one-fifth would 
be the portion related to higher diesel costs based on our estimated 88 million gallons consumed annually. See Item 1A. “Risk 
Factors — We May Face Increased Costs or Inadequate Availability of Raw Materials, Energy and Transportation”.

Interest Rates

We are exposed to changes in interest rates, primarily as a result of our short-term and long-term debt. We may from time to 
time use interest rate swap agreements to manage the interest rate characteristics of a portion of our outstanding debt. Based on 
the amounts and mix of our fixed and floating rate debt at September 30, 2017, if market interest rates increase an average of 100 
basis points, our annual interest expense would increase by approximately $22 million. We determined these amounts by considering 
the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing costs. This analysis does not consider the effects of changes in the 
level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors — Interest Rate Increases 
Could Impact Our Financial Condition”.

Pension Plans

Our pension plans are influenced by trends in the financial markets and the regulatory environment, among other factors. 
Adverse general stock market trends and falling interest rates increase plan costs and liabilities. During fiscal 2017, the effect of 
a 0.25% decrease in the discount rate would have reduced pre-tax income by approximately $11.1 million and a 0.25% increase 
in the discount rate would have increased pre-tax income by $8.2 million. During fiscal 2016, the effect of a 0.25% decrease in 
the discount rate would have reduced pre-tax income by approximately $13.3 million and a 0.25% increase in the discount rate 
would  have  reduced  pre-tax  income  by  $0.9  million.  Similarly,  MEPPs  in  which  we  participate  could  experience  similar 
circumstances  which  could  impact  our  funding  requirements  and  therefore  expenses.  See  “Note  15.  Retirement  Plans  — 
Multiemployer Plans” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. See also Item 1A. “Risk Factors — We May Incur 
Increased Employee Benefit Costs and Certain of Our Pension Plans Will Likely Require Additional Cash Contributions” and 
“Risk Factors - We May Incur Withdrawal Liability and/or Increased Funding Requirements in Connection with the MEPPs 
in Which We Participate.”

Foreign Currency

We predominately operate in U.S. markets, but derived 17.6% of our net sales in fiscal 2017 from outside the U.S. through 
international operations or exports to foreign customers, some of which were transacted in U.S. dollars. In addition, certain of our 
domestic operations have sales to foreign customers. In conducting our foreign operations, we also make inter-company sales and 
receive royalties and dividends denominated in many different currencies. All of this exposes us to the effect of changes in foreign 
currency exchange rates. Flows of foreign currencies into and out of our operations are generally stable and regularly occurring 
and are recorded at fair market value in our financial statements. Our foreign currency management policy permits us to enter into 
foreign currency hedges when these flows exceed a threshold, which is a function of these cash flows and forecasted annual 
operations. 

We issue inter-company loans to and receive foreign cash deposits from our foreign subsidiaries in their local currencies, 
exposing us to the effect of changes in spot exchange rates between loan issue and loan repayment dates and changes in spot 
exchange rates from deposits. From time to time, we may use foreign-exchange hedge contracts with terms of generally less than 
one year to hedge these exposures. Although our derivative and other foreign currency sensitive instruments expose us to market 
risk, fluctuations in the value of these instruments are mitigated by expected offsetting fluctuations in the matched exposures.

During fiscal 2017 and 2016, the effect of a hypothetical 10% change in foreign segment income driven by exchange rates 
would have impacted our segment results by approximately $26 million and $23 million, respectively. See “Note 21. Segment 
Information” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 

During  fiscal  2017  and  2016,  the  effect  of  a  1%  change  in  exchange  rates  would  have  impacted  accumulated  other 
comprehensive income by approximately $34 million and $28 million, respectively. This impact does not consider the effects of 
a stronger or weaker dollar on our ability to compete for export business or the overall economic activity that could exist in such 
an environment. Changes in foreign exchange rates could impact the price and therefore also the demand for our products. See

and Social and Political Change”.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1.  Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Description of Business

Unless the context otherwise requires, “we”, “us”, “our”, “WestRock” and “the Company” refer to the business of WestRock 

Company, its wholly-owned subsidiaries and its partially-owned consolidated subsidiaries. 

WestRock is a multinational provider of paper and packaging solutions for consumer and corrugated packaging markets. We 
partner with our customers to provide differentiated paper and packaging solutions that help them win in the marketplace. Our 
team members support customers around the world from our operating and business locations in North America, South America, 
Europe, Asia and Australia. We also sell real estate primarily in the Charleston, SC region. 

WestRock was formed on March 6, 2015 for the purpose of effecting the Combination and, prior to the Combination, did not 
conduct any activities other than those incidental to its formation and the matters contemplated by the Business Combination 
Agreement. On July 1, 2015, pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, RockTenn and MWV completed a strategic 
combination of their respective businesses and RockTenn and MWV each became wholly-owned subsidiaries of WestRock. 
RockTenn was the accounting acquirer in the Combination. We believe the Combination combined two industry leaders to create 
a leading global provider of consumer and corrugated packaging solutions. See “Note 6. Merger, Acquisitions and Investment” 
for additional information.

On May 15, 2016, WestRock completed the Separation, pursuant to which we disposed of our former Specialty Chemicals 
segment in its entirety and ceased to consolidate its assets, liabilities and results of operations in our consolidated financial 
statements. Accordingly, we have presented the financial position and results of operations of our former Specialty Chemicals 
segment as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. See “Note 
7. Discontinued Operations” for additional information.

On April 6, 2017, we completed the HH&B Sale. We used the proceeds from the HH&B Sale in connection with the MPS 
Acquisition. We recorded a pre-tax gain on sale of HH&B of $192.8 million in fiscal 2017. See “Note 8. Assets Held For Sale” 
for additional information.

On June 6, 2017, we completed the MPS Acquisition. MPS is a global provider of print-based specialty packaging solutions 
and its differentiated product offering includes premium folding cartons, inserts, labels and rigid packaging. MPS is reported in 
our Consumer Packaging segment. See “Note 6. Merger, Acquisitions and Investment” for additional information.

Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include our accounts and the accounts of our partially-owned consolidated subsidiaries. 
Equity investments in which we exercise significant influence but do not control and are not the primary beneficiary are accounted 
for using the equity method. Investments in which we are not able to exercise significant influence over the investee are accounted 
for under the cost method. Our equity and cost method investments are not significant either individually or in the aggregate. We 
have eliminated all significant intercompany accounts and transactions. See “Note 21. Segment Information” for our equity 
method investments.

Reclassifications

In fiscal 2017, we reported assets held for sale separately on our consolidated balance sheet, as well as distributed earnings 
from equity investments on our consolidated statements of cash flows. The presentation of other current assets on our consolidated 
balance sheets and other assets on our consolidated statements of cash flows at and for the year ended September 30, 2016 has 
been changed to conform to the current year presentation. In addition, due to the retrospective adoption of certain provisions of 
ASU 2015-07 “Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share” that eliminated the 
requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value 
(or its equivalent) practical expedient, we have conformed the September 30, 2016 table that summarizes our pension plan assets 
measured at fair value to the current year presentation and correspondingly removed the table that reflected changes in our level 
3 pension plan assets since we had no level 3 assets remaining after the adoption.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Use of Estimates

Preparing consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that 
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated 
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ 
from those estimates, and the differences could be material.

The most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements include estimates 
to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill, intangibles and property, plant and equipment, to determine the useful lives of assets 
that are amortized or depreciated, and to measure income taxes, self-insured obligations, restructuring activities and allocate the 
purchase price of an acquired business to the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. In addition, significant estimates form 
the basis for our reserves with respect to collectibility of accounts receivable, inventory valuations, pension benefits, deferred tax 
asset valuation allowances and certain benefits provided to current and retired employees. Various assumptions and other factors 
underlie the determination of these significant estimates. The process of determining significant estimates is fact specific and takes 
into account factors such as historical experience, current and expected economic conditions, product mix, and in some cases, 
actuarial techniques. We regularly evaluate these significant factors and make adjustments where facts and circumstances dictate.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have 
been rendered, our price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. Delivery is not considered 
to have occurred until the customer takes title and assumes the risks and rewards of ownership. The timing of revenue recognition 
is dependent on the location of title transfer which is normally either on the exit from our plants (i.e., shipping point) or on arrival 
at customers’ plants (i.e., destination point). We do not recognize revenue from transactions where we bill customers, but retain 
custody and title to these products until the date custody and title transfer. We do not have any significant multiple deliverable 
revenue arrangements.

We net, against our gross sales, provisions for discounts, returns, allowances, customer rebates and other adjustments. We 
account for such provisions during the same period in which we record the related revenues. We include in net sales any amounts 
related to shipping and handling that are billed to a customer.

Shipping and Handling Costs

We classify shipping and handling costs as a component of cost of goods sold.

Cash Equivalents

We consider all highly liquid investments that mature three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. 
The carrying amounts we report in the consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents approximate fair market values. 
We place our cash and cash equivalents with large credit worthy banks, which limits the amount of our credit exposure.

Accounts Receivable and Allowances

We perform periodic evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and generally do not require collateral. The weighted 
average of our receivables collection is within 30 to 60 days. We sell certain receivables under our A/R Sales Agreement. We serve 
a diverse customer base primarily in North America, South America, Europe, Asia and Australia, and, therefore, have limited 
exposure from credit loss to any particular customer or industry segment.

We state accounts receivable at the amount owed by the customer, net of an allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts, 
returns and allowances, cash discounts and other adjustments. We do not discount accounts receivable because we generally collect 
accounts receivable over a relatively short time. We account for sales and other taxes that are imposed on and concurrent with 
individual revenue-producing transactions between a customer and us on a net basis which excludes the taxes from our net sales. 
We estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts based on our historical experience, current economic conditions and the credit 
worthiness of our customers. We charge off receivables when they are determined to be no longer collectible. In fiscal 2017, 2016
and 2015 our bad debt expense was not significant.

Inventories

We value substantially all U.S. inventories at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined on the LIFO basis. We value 
all other inventories at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined using methods that approximate cost computed on a FIFO 
basis. These other inventories represent primarily foreign inventories, spare parts inventories and certain inventoried supplies and 
aggregate to approximately 32% and 35% of FIFO cost of all inventory at September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 

Prior to the application of the LIFO method, our U.S. operating divisions use a variety of methods to estimate the FIFO cost 
of their finished goods inventories. Such methods include standard costs, or average costs computed by dividing the actual cost 
of goods manufactured by the tons produced and multiplying this amount by the tons of inventory on hand. Lastly, certain operations 
calculate a ratio, on a plant by plant basis, the numerator of which is the cost of goods sold and the denominator is net sales. This 
ratio is applied to the estimated sales value of the finished goods inventory. Variances and other unusual items are analyzed to 
determine whether it is appropriate to include those items in the value of inventory. Examples of variances and unusual items that 
are considered to be current period charges include, but are not limited to, abnormal production levels, freight, handling costs, 
and wasted materials (spoilage). Cost includes raw materials and supplies, direct labor, indirect labor related to the manufacturing 
process and depreciation and other factory overheads. Our inventoried spare parts are measured at average cost.

Property, Plant and Equipment

We state property, plant and equipment at cost. Cost includes major expenditures for improvements and replacements that 
extend useful lives, increase capacity, increase revenues or reduce costs. During fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, we capitalized interest 
of approximately $7.0 million, $7.6 million and $4.0 million, respectively. For financial reporting purposes, we provide depreciation 
and amortization primarily on a straight-line method generally over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:
Buildings and building improvements. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15-40 years
Machinery and equipment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3-25 years
Transportation equipment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3-8 years

Generally, our machinery and equipment have estimated useful lives between 3 and 25 years; however, select portions of 
machinery and equipment primarily at our mills have estimated useful lives up to 44 years. Greater than 90% of the cost of our 
mill assets have lives of 25 years or less. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the asset life or the lease 
term, generally between 3 and 10 years. 
 

Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets 

We review the carrying value of our goodwill annually at the beginning of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more often 
if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed fair value as set forth in ASC 350, “Intangibles 
— Goodwill and Other.” See “Note 7. Discontinued Operations” for information on the first quarter of fiscal 2016 goodwill 
impairment test and resulting charge. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is an operating segment 
or one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. A component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if 
the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly 
reviews the operating results of that component. However, two or more components of an operating segment are aggregated and 
deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics. The amount of goodwill acquired in a 
business combination that is assigned to one or more reporting units as of the acquisition date is the excess of the purchase price 
of the acquired businesses (or portion thereof) included in the reporting unit, over the fair value assigned to the individual assets 

65

WESTROCK COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

acquired  or  liabilities  assumed.  Goodwill  is  assigned  to  the  reporting  unit(s)  expected  to  benefit  from  the  synergies  of  the 
combination even though other assets or liabilities of the acquired entity may not be assigned to that reporting unit. We determine 
recoverability by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill applies to the carrying value, 
including goodwill, of that reporting unit using a discounted cash flow model.

Prior to the adoption of ASU 2017-04, “Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment”, the goodwill impairment model is a 
two-step process. We have not yet adopted the ASU. An amendment to ASC 350 became effective December 2011 that allows a 
qualitative assessment, prior to step one, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit 
exceeds its carrying amount. We did not attempt a qualitative assessment and moved directly to step one. In step one, we utilize 
the present value of expected net cash flows to determine the estimated fair value of our reporting units. This present value model 
requires management to estimate future net cash flows, the timing of these cash flows, and a discount rate (based on a weighted 
average cost of capital), which represents the time value of money and the inherent risk and uncertainty of the future cash flows. 
Factors that management must estimate when performing this step in the process include, among other items, sales volume, prices, 
inflation, discount rates, exchange rates, tax rates, anticipated synergies and productivity improvements resulting from acquisitions, 
capital expenditures and continuous improvement projects. The assumptions we use to estimate future cash flows are consistent 
with the assumptions that the reporting units use for internal planning purposes, updated to reflect current expectations. If we 
determine that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not 
impaired. If we determine that the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, we would complete step 
two of the impairment analysis. Step two involves determining the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill and comparing 
it to the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value 
of that goodwill, we recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, of those reporting units that have goodwill, our Consumer Packaging and Brazil 
Corrugated reporting units had a fair value which exceeded their carrying value by a little more than 10%, due primarily to the 
Combination and the MPS Acquisition and the corresponding fair value accounting. If we had concluded that it was appropriate 
to increase the discount rate we used by 100 basis point to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit that has goodwill, the fair 
value for each of our reporting units would have continued to exceed its carrying value except for the Consumer Packaging and 
Brazil Corrugated reporting units. No events have occurred since the latest annual goodwill impairment assessment that would 
necessitate an interim goodwill impairment assessment.

 
We follow the provisions included in ASC 360, “Property, Plant and Equipment” in determining whether the carrying value 
of any of our long-lived assets, including amortizing intangibles other than goodwill, is impaired. The ASC 360 test is a three-
step test for assets that are “held and used” as that term is defined by ASC 360. We determine whether indicators of impairment 
are present. We review long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount 
of the long-lived asset might not be recoverable. If we determine that indicators of impairment are present, we determine whether 
the estimated undiscounted cash flows for the potentially impaired assets are less than the carrying value. This requires management 
to estimate future net cash flows through operations over the remaining useful life of the asset and its ultimate disposition. The 
assumptions we use to estimate future cash flows are consistent with the assumptions we use for internal planning purposes, 
updated to reflect current expectations. If our estimated undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, we estimate 
the fair value of the asset and record an impairment charge if the carrying value is greater than the fair value of the asset. We 
estimate fair value using discounted cash flows, observable prices for similar assets, or other valuation techniques. We record 
assets classified as “held for sale” at the lower of their carrying value or estimated fair value less anticipated costs to sell.

 
Included in our long-lived assets are certain identifiable intangible assets. These intangible assets are amortized based on the 
approximate pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed or straight-line if the pattern was not reliably determinable. 
Estimated useful lives range from 1 to 40 years and have a weighted average life of approximately 16.6 years.

Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors, market conditions and operational 
performance. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that assets associated with a particular 
operation are impaired. Evaluating impairment also requires us to estimate future operating results and cash flows, which also 
require judgment by management. Any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition 
and results of operations.

Restructuring

Our restructuring and other costs, net include primarily items such as restructuring portions of our operations, acquisition 
costs, divestiture costs and integration costs. We have restructured portions of our operations from time to time, have current 
restructuring initiatives taking place, and it is possible that we may engage in future restructuring activities. Identifying and 
calculating the cost to exit these operations requires certain assumptions to be made, the most significant of which are anticipated 
future liabilities, including severance costs, leases and other contractual obligations, and the adjustment of property, plant and 
equipment to net realizable value. We believe our estimates are reasonable, considering our knowledge of the industries we operate 
in, previous experience in exiting activities and valuations we may obtain from independent third parties. Although our estimates 
have been reasonably accurate in the past, significant judgment is required, and these estimates and assumptions may change as 
additional information becomes available and facts or circumstances change.

Business Combinations

From time to time, we may enter into business combinations. In accordance with ASC 805, “Business Combinations”, we 
generally recognize the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interests in an acquiree at their 
fair values as of the date of acquisition. We measure goodwill as the excess of consideration transferred, which we also measure 
at fair value, over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The acquisition 
method of accounting requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the fair values of the elements of a 
business combination as of the date of acquisition, including the fair values of identifiable intangible assets, deferred tax asset 
valuation allowances, liabilities including those related to debt, pensions and other postretirement plans, uncertain tax positions, 
contingent consideration and contingencies. This method also requires us to refine these estimates over a measurement period not 
to exceed one year to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, 
if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date. If we are required to adjust provisional 
amounts that we have recorded for the fair values of assets and liabilities in connection with acquisitions, these adjustments could 
have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

Significant estimates and assumptions in estimating the fair value of acquired technology, customer relationships, and other 
identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets. If the subsequent actual 
results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used 
to develop these values, we could record impairment charges. In addition, we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired 
assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense. If our estimates of the economic lives change, 
depreciation or amortization expenses could be increased or decreased, or the acquired asset could be impaired.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments and Nonfinancial Assets and Liabilities

We estimate fair values in accordance with ASC 820 “Fair Value Measurement.” We define fair value as the price that would 
be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or 
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.

Financial instruments not recognized at fair value on a recurring or nonrecurring basis include cash and cash equivalents, 
accounts receivables, certain other current assets, short-term debt, accounts payable, certain other current liabilities and long-term 
debt. With the exception of long-term debt, the carrying amounts of these financial instruments approximate their fair values due 
to their short maturities. The fair values of our long-term debt are estimated using quoted market prices or are based on the 
discounted value of future cash flows. We disclose the fair value of long-term debt in “Note 11. Debt” and our pension and 
postretirement assets and liabilities in “Note 15. Retirement Plans”. We have, or from time to time may have, financial instruments 
recognized at fair value including Supplemental Plans that are nonqualified deferred compensation plans pursuant to which assets 
are invested primarily in mutual funds, interest rate derivatives, commodity derivatives or other similar class of assets or liabilities, 
the fair value of which are not significant. We measure the fair value of our mutual fund investments based on quoted prices in 
active markets, and our derivative contracts, if any, based on discounted cash flows. 

We measure certain nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These assets and 
liabilities include cost and equity method investments when they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired, assets acquired 
and liabilities assumed in a merger or an acquisition or in a nonmonetary exchange, and property, plant and equipment and goodwill 
and other intangible assets that are written down to fair value when they are held for sale or determined to be impaired. Given the 
nature of nonfinancial assets and liabilities, evaluating their fair value from the perspective of a market participant is inherently 

67

WESTROCK COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

complex. Assumptions and estimates about future values can be affected by a variety of internal and external factors. Changes in 
these factors may require us to revise our estimates and could result in future impairment charges for goodwill and acquired 
intangible assets, or retroactively adjust provisional amounts that we have recorded for the fair values of assets and liabilities in 
connection with business combinations. These adjustments could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of 
operations. We discuss fair values in more detail in “Note 12. Fair Value”.

Derivatives

We are exposed to interest rate risk, commodity price risk and foreign currency exchange risk. To manage these risks, from 
time to time and to varying degrees, we may enter into a variety of financial derivative transactions and certain physical commodity 
transactions that are determined to be derivatives. Interest rate swaps may be entered into to manage the interest rate risk associated 
with a portion of our outstanding debt. Interest rate swaps are either designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges of 
forecasted floating interest payments on variable rate debt or fair value hedges of fixed rate debt, or we may elect not to treat them 
as accounting hedges. Swaps or forward contracts on certain commodities may be entered into to manage the price risk associated 
with forecasted purchases or sales of those commodities. In addition, certain commodity financial derivative contracts and physical 
commodity contracts that are determined to be derivatives may not be designated as accounting hedges because either they do not 
meet the criteria for treatment as accounting hedges under ASC 815, “Derivatives and Hedging”, or we elect not to treat them as 
accounting hedges under ASC 815. We may also enter into forward contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign 
currency rates with respect to transactions denominated in currencies such as Canadian dollars, the Euro or Brazilian Real. These 
also can either be designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges or not so designated.

Outstanding financial derivative instruments expose us to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to 
the derivative agreements. Our credit exposure related to these financial instruments is represented by the fair value of contracts 
reported as assets. We manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through minimum credit standards, diversification of 
counterparties and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk. We may enter into financial derivative contracts that may 
contain credit-risk-related contingent features which could result in a counterparty requesting immediate payment or demanding 
immediate and ongoing full overnight collateralization on derivative instruments in net liability positions. 

For financial derivative instruments that are designated as a cash flow hedge for accounting purposes, the effective portion 
of the gain or loss on the financial derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified 
into earnings in the same line item associated with the forecasted transaction, and in the same period or periods during which the 
forecasted transaction affects earnings. Gains and losses on the financial derivative representing either hedge ineffectiveness or 
hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in current earnings.

We have at times entered into interest rate swap agreements that effectively modified our exposure to interest rate risk by 
converting a portion of our interest payments on floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis, thus reducing the impact of interest rate 
changes on future interest expense. These agreements typically involved the receipt of floating rate amounts in exchange for fixed 
interest rate payments over the life of the agreements without an exchange of the underlying principal amount.

At September 30, 2017, there were no interest rate or commodity derivatives outstanding, and the notional amount of foreign 
currency derivatives were $47.8 million. At September 30, 2016, there were no foreign currency, interest rate or commodity 
derivatives outstanding. 

Health Insurance

We are self-insured for the majority of our group health insurance costs. However, we seek to limit our health insurance costs 
by entering into certain stop loss insurance coverage. Due to mergers, acquisitions and other factors, we may have plans that do 
not include stop loss insurance. We calculate our group health insurance reserve on an undiscounted basis based on estimated 
reserve rates. We utilize claims lag data provided by our claims administrators to compute the required estimated reserve rate. We 
calculate our average monthly claims paid using the actual monthly payments during the trailing 12-month period. At that time, 
we also calculate our required reserve using the reserve rates discussed above. While we believe that our assumptions are appropriate, 
significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our group health 
insurance costs.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Workers’ Compensation

We purchase large risk deductible workers’ compensation policies for the majority of our workers’ compensation liabilities 
that are subject to various deductibles to limit our exposure. We calculate our workers’ compensation reserves on an undiscounted 
basis based on estimated actuarially calculated development factors. While we believe that our assumptions are appropriate, 
significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our workers' 
compensation costs.

Income Taxes

We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and 
liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amount and 
the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. 
The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the 
enactment date. All deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as noncurrent in our consolidated balance sheet in accordance 
with ASU 2015-17. We adopted these provisions prospectively on December 31, 2015, and prior periods were not retrospectively 
adjusted.

We record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such 
determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary 
differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, recent financial operations and their associated valuation 
allowances, if any. In the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize or not realize our deferred income tax assets 
in the future in their net recorded amount, we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance, which would reduce or 
increase the provision for income taxes, respectively. 

Certain provisions of ASC 740, “Income Taxes” provide that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized 
when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals 
or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. Income tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold 
at the effective date to be recognized. See “Note 14. Income Taxes.”

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

We account for pension and other postretirement benefits in accordance with ASC 715, “Compensation — Retirement Benefits”. 
Accordingly, we recognize the funded status of our pension plans as assets or liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. The 
funded status is the difference between our projected benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets. The determination of our 
obligation and expense for pension and other postretirement benefits is dependent on our selection of certain assumptions used 
by actuaries in calculating such amounts. We describe these assumptions in “Note 15. Retirement Plans,” which include, among 
others, the discount rate, expected long-term rates of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation levels. As provided 
under ASC 715, we defer actual results that differ from our assumptions, i.e. actuarial gains and losses, and amortize the difference 
over future periods. Therefore, these differences generally affect our recognized expense and funding requirements in future 
periods. Actuarial gains and losses occur when actual experience differs from the estimates used to determine the components of 
net periodic pension cost and when certain assumptions used to determine the fair value of the plan assets or projected benefit 
obligation are updated, such as but not limited to, changes in the discount rate, plan amendments, differences between actual and 
expected returns on plan assets, mortality assumptions and plan remeasurement.

The amount of unrecognized actuarial gains and losses recognized in the current year’s operations is based on amortizing the 
unrecognized gains or losses for each plan that exceed the larger of 10% of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of 
plan assets, also known as “the corridor”. The amount of unrecognized gain or loss that exceeds the corridor is amortized over the 
average future service of the plan participants or the average life expectancy of inactive plan participants for plans where all or 
almost all of the plan participants are inactive. While we believe that our assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in 
our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement benefit 
obligations and our future expense.

Share-Based Compensation

We recognize expense for share-based compensation plans based on the estimated fair value of the related awards in accordance 
with ASC 718, “Compensation — Stock Compensation”. Pursuant to our incentive stock plans, we can grant options and restricted 
stock, SARs and restricted stock units to employees and our non-employee directors. The grants generally vest over a period of 
up to three years depending on the nature of the award, except for non-employee director grants, which typically vest over a period 
of up to one year. Our restricted stock grants to employees generally contain performance or market conditions that must be met 
in conjunction with a service requirement for the shares to vest. We charge compensation under the plan to earnings over each 
increment’s individual restriction period. See “Note 17. Share-Based Compensation” for additional information.
 

Asset Retirement Obligations

The Company accounts for asset retirement obligations in accordance with ASC 410, “Asset Retirement and Environmental 
Obligations”. A liability and an asset are recorded equal to the present value of the estimated costs associated with the retirement 
of long-lived assets where a legal or contractual obligation exists and the liability can be reasonably estimated. The liability is 
accreted over time and the asset is depreciated over the remaining life of the related asset. Upon settlement of the liability, we will 
recognize a gain or loss for any difference between the settlement amount and the liability recorded. Asset retirement obligations 
with indeterminate settlement dates are not recorded until such time that a reasonable estimate may be made. Our asset retirement 
obligations  consist  primarily  of  landfill  closure  and  post-closure  costs  at  certain  of  our  mills. At  September 30,  2017  and 
September 30, 2016, we had recorded liabilities of $70.5 million and $78.9 million, respectively. 

Repair and Maintenance Costs

We expense routine repair and maintenance costs as we incur them. We defer certain expenses we incur during planned major 
maintenance activities and recognize the expenses ratably over the shorter of the estimated interval until the next major maintenance 
activity or the life of the deferred item. This maintenance is generally performed every twelve to twenty-four months and has a 
significant impact on our results of operations in the period performed primarily due to lost production during the maintenance 
period.

Foreign Currency

We translate the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations from their functional currency into U.S. dollars at the rate of 
exchange in effect as of the balance sheet date. We reflect the resulting translation adjustments in equity. We translate the revenues 
and expenses of our foreign operations at a daily average rate prevailing for each month during the fiscal year. We include gains 
or losses from foreign currency transactions, such as those resulting from the settlement of foreign receivables or payables, in the 
consolidated statements of operations. We recorded a gain on foreign currency transactions of $4.3 million and $2.9 million in 
fiscal 2017 and 2015, respectively. We recorded a loss on foreign currency transactions of $6.5 million in fiscal 2016. 

Environmental Remediation Costs

We accrue for losses associated with our environmental remediation obligations when it is probable that we have incurred a 
liability and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We generally recognize accruals for estimated losses from our 
environmental remediation obligations no later than completion of the remedial feasibility study and adjust such accruals as further 
information develops or circumstances change. We recognize recoveries of our environmental remediation costs from other parties 
as assets when we deem their receipt probable. See “Note 19. Commitments and Contingencies.”

New Accounting Standards - Recently Adopted

In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-17, “Interests Held through Related Parties That Are under Common Control”, 
which amends certain provisions of ASC 810, “Consolidation”. The ASU amends the consolidation requirements that apply to a 
single decision maker’s evaluation of interests held through related parties that are under common control when it is determining 
whether it is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. Under the ASU, a reporting entity considers its indirect economic 
interests in a variable interest entity held through related parties that are under common control on a proportionate basis, in a 
manner consistent with its consideration of its indirect economic interests held through related parties that are not under common 
control. These provisions are effective for annual periods, and for interim periods within those annual periods, beginning on or 

70

WESTROCK COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

after December 15, 2016 (October 1, 2017 for us). We adopted these provisions on October 1, 2017, and the adoption of these 
provisions did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09 “Compensation - Stock Compensation: Improvements To Employee Share 
Based Payment Accounting”, which amends certain provisions of ASC 718. The ASU will require all income tax effects of awards 
to be recognized in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled. It also will allow an employer to repurchase more 
of an employee’s shares than it can today for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting and to make a policy 
election to account for forfeitures as they occur. The provisions are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 
(October 1, 2017 for us), including interim periods within those fiscal years. We adopted these provisions on October 1, 2017, 
and the adoption of these provisions did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-07 “Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures: Simplifying the Transition 
to  the  Equity  Method  of Accounting”,  which  amends  certain  provisions  of ASC  323  “Investments-Equity  Method  and  Joint 
Ventures”. The ASU eliminates the requirement that an investor retrospectively apply equity method accounting when an investment 
that it had accounted for by another method initially qualifies for the equity method. The guidance will be applied prospectively 
and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 (October 1, 2017 for us), including interim periods within 
those fiscal years. We adopted these provisions on October 1, 2017, and the adoption of these provisions did not have a material 
effect on our consolidated financial statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-05 “Derivatives and Hedging - Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing 
Hedge Accounting Relationships”, which amends certain provisions of ASC 815 “Derivatives and Hedging”. The ASU clarifies 
that a change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument that has been designated as a hedging instrument under ASC 815 does 
not, in and of itself, require de-designation of the instrument if all other hedge criteria continue to be met. These provisions are 
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 (October 1, 2017 for us), including interim periods within those fiscal 
years, and can be adopted using a prospective or modified retrospective approach. Early adoption is permitted. We adopted these 
provisions on October 1, 2017, and the adoption of these provisions did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial 
statements. 

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11 “Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory”, which amends certain provisions 
of ASC 330 “Inventory”. The ASU requires inventory to be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. These provisions 
do not apply to inventory that is measured using LIFO or the retail inventory method. These provisions apply to all other inventory, 
which includes inventory that is measured using FIFO or average cost. These provisions are effective for fiscal years beginning 
after December 15, 2016 (October 1, 2017 for us), including interim periods within those fiscal years, applied prospectively. Early 
adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. We adopted these provisions on October 1, 
2017, and the adoption of these provisions did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements given that the 
majority of our inventory is measured at LIFO.

New Accounting Standards - Recently Issued

In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, “Derivatives and Hedging: Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging 
Activities”. The amendments in this ASU better align an entity’s risk management activities and financial reporting for hedging 
relationships through changes to both the designation and measurement guidance for qualifying hedging relationships and the 
presentation of hedge results. To meet that objective, the amendments expand and refine hedge accounting for both nonfinancial 
and financial risk components and align the recognition and presentation of the effects of the hedging instrument and the hedged 
item in the financial statements. The amendments in this ASU also make certain targeted improvements to simplify the application 
of hedge accounting guidance and ease the administrative burden of hedge documentation requirements and assessing hedge 
effectiveness. These provisions are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 (October 1, 2020 for us), including 
interim periods within those fiscal years, and should be applied prospectively. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently 
evaluating the impact of this ASU.

In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, “Compensation - Stock Compensation: Scope of Modification Accounting”. 
The amendments in the ASU include guidance on determining which changes to the terms and conditions of share-based payment 
awards require an entity to apply modification accounting under ASC 718, “Compensation - Stock Compensation” and require 
entities to account for the effects of a modification unless all of the following conditions are met: (a) the fair value (or calculated 
value or intrinsic value, if such an alternative measurement method is used) of the modified award is the same as the fair value 
(or value using an alternative measurement method) of the original award immediately before the original award is modified; (b) 

71

WESTROCK COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the vesting conditions of the modified award are the same as the vesting conditions of the original award immediately before the 
original award is modified; and (c) the classification of the modified award as an equity instrument or a liability instrument is the 
same as the classification of the original award immediately before the original award is modified. These provisions are effective 
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 (October 1, 2018 for us), including interim periods within those fiscal years, 
and should be applied prospectively. Early adoption is permitted. We currently do not expect that the adoption of these provisions 
will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 

In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, “Compensation: Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost 
and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost”. The guidance in this update requires that an employer disaggregate the service 
cost component from the other components of net benefit cost. Non-service cost components of net periodic pension cost are 
required to be presented in the income statement separately from the service cost component and outside the subtotal of operating 
income. The amendments in the update also allow only the service cost component to be eligible for capitalization for internally 
developed capital projects. The amendments in this update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 
(October 1, 2018 for us), including interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted. The guidance on the 
presentation of the components of net periodic benefit cost in the income statement will be applied retrospectively. The guidance 
limiting the capitalization of net periodic benefit cost in assets to the service cost component will be applied prospectively. The 
guidance includes a practical expedient that permits us to estimate amounts for comparative periods using the information previously 
disclosed in our pension and other postretirement plan footnote. We are currently evaluating the impact of this ASU. 

In February 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-05, “Other Income: Clarifying the Scope of Asset Derecognition Guidance 
and Accounting for Partial Sales of Nonfinancial Assets”. The ASU provides guidance for recognizing gains and losses from the 
transfer of nonfinancial assets in contracts with noncustomers. Specifically, the ASU clarifies the scope of an “in substance 
nonfinancial  asset”,  clarifies  the  treatment  of  partial  sales  of  nonfinancial  assets  and  clarifies  guidance  on  accounting  for 
contributions of nonfinancial assets to joint ventures and equity method investees. The amendments in this update are effective 
for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (October 1, 2018 for us) including interim reporting periods within those 
annual reporting periods. Early adoption is permitted. The ASU may be applied by either a full or modified retrospective approach. 
We are currently evaluating the impact of this ASU. 

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, “Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment”, which amends the guidance 
in ASC 350, “Intangibles-Goodwill and Other”. The ASU eliminates the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill 
to measure a goodwill impairment charge. Instead, entities will record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting 
unit’s carrying amount over its fair value. The ASU is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed in periods 
beginning after December 15, 2019 (October 1, 2020 for us). Early adoption is permitted for annual and interim goodwill impairment 
testing dates after January 1, 2017. The ASU will be applied prospectively. We currently do not expect that the adoption of these 
provisions will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01, “Clarifying the Definition of a Business”, which amends the guidance in 
ASC 805, “Business Combinations”. The ASU changes the definition of a business to assist entities with evaluating when a set of 
transferred assets and activities is a business. Under the new guidance, an entity first determines whether substantially all of the 
fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets. If this 
threshold is met, the set is not a business. If it is not met, the entity then evaluates whether the set meets the requirements that a 
business include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create 
outputs. The ASU defines an output as “the result of inputs and processes applied to those inputs that provide goods or services 
to customers, investment income (such as dividends or interest), or other revenues.” The ASU is effective for annual reporting 
periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (October 1, 2018 for us), including interim periods within those annual periods, and 
early adoption is permitted. The ASU will be applied prospectively to any transactions occurring within the period of adoption. 
We are currently evaluating the impact of these provisions.

In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, “Restricted Cash”, which amends the guidance in ASC 230, “Statement 
of Cash Flows”. The new ASU clarifies how entities should present restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statement 
of cash flows. The new guidance will require entities to show the changes in the total of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash 
and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. As a result, entities will no longer present transfers between cash 
and cash equivalents and restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. When cash, cash equivalents, 
restricted cash, and restricted cash equivalents are presented in more than one line item on the balance sheet, the new guidance 
requires a reconciliation of the totals in the statement of cash flows to the related captions in the balance sheet. This reconciliation 
can be prepared either on the face of the statement of cash flows or in the notes to the financial statements. These provisions are 

72

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

effective for annual periods, and for interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017 (October 1, 
2018 for us), applied retrospectively for each period presented. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact 
of these provisions. 

In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, “Income Taxes: Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory”, 
which requires companies to recognize the income tax effects of intercompany sales and transfers of assets other than inventory 
(e.g., intangible assets) in the period in which the transfer occurs. Current guidance requires companies to defer the income tax 
effects of intercompany transfers of assets until the asset has been sold to an outside party or otherwise recognized through use. 
The new guidance will require companies to defer the income tax effects only of intercompany transfers of inventory. The ASU 
is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (October 1, 2018 for us), including interim periods 
within those annual periods. The guidance requires companies to apply a modified retrospective approach with a cumulative catch-
up adjustment to opening retained earnings in the period of adoption. Early adoption is permitted. We currently do not expect that 
the adoption of these provisions will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15 “Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments”, which amends 
the guidance in ASC 230, “Statement of Cash Flows”. The ASU clarifies how entities should classify certain cash receipts and 
cash payments on the statement of cash flows for the following transactions: debt prepayment or extinguishment costs, settlement 
of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest 
rate of the borrowing, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of 
insurance claims, proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance, distributions received from equity method 
investees and beneficial interest in securitization transactions. The ASU also clarifies how the predominance principle should be 
applied when cash receipts and cash payments have aspects of more than one class of cash flows. The guidance requires retrospective 
adoption and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 (October 1, 2018 for us), including interim periods 
within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted and an entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in 
the period of adoption. We are currently evaluating the impact of these provisions.

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13 “Financial Instruments - Credit losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on 
Financial Instruments”, which amends certain provisions of ASC 326, “Financial Instruments-Credit Loss”. The ASU changes 
the impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments. For trade and other receivables, held to maturity 
debt securities, loans and other instruments, entities will be required to use a new forward-looking “expected loss” model that 
generally will result in the earlier recognition of allowances for losses. For available for sale debt securities with unrealized losses, 
entities will be required to measure credit losses in a manner similar to what they do today, except that losses will be recognized 
as allowances rather than reductions in the amortized cost of the securities. Additionally, entities will have to disclose significantly 
more information, including information used to track credit quality by year or origination for most financing receivables. The 
ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019 (October 1, 2020 for us), including interim 
periods within those annual periods, and will be applied as a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning 
of the first reporting period for which the guidance is effective. We currently do not expect that the adoption of these provisions 
will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 “Leases”, which is codified in ASC 842 “Leases” and supersedes current 
lease guidance in ASC 840. These provisions require lessees to put a right-of-use asset and lease liability on their balance sheet 
for operating and financing leases that have a term of more than one year. Expense will be recognized in the income statement 
similar to current accounting guidance. For lessors, the ASU modifies the classification criteria and the accounting for sales-type 
and direct financing leases. Entities will need to disclose qualitative and quantitative information about their leases, including 
characteristics and amounts recognized in the financial statements. These provisions are effective for fiscal years beginning after 
December 15, 2018 (October 1, 2019 for us), including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. 
Entities are required to use a modified retrospective approach upon adoption to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of 
the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. We have not completed our assessment. We currently expect 
that the adoption of ASC 842 as of October 1, 2019 will result in recording additional assets and liabilities not previously reflected 
on our consolidated balance sheets, but we do not expect the adoption to have a significant impact on the recognition, measurement, 
or presentation of lease expenses within the consolidated statements of operations or the consolidated statements of cash flows.

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09 which is codified in ASC 606 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” and 
supersedes both the revenue recognition requirement in ASC 605 “Revenue Recognition” and most industry-specific guidance. 
The core principle of ASC 606 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to 
customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or 

73

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

services. To achieve that core principle, an entity should apply the five steps set forth in ASC 606. An entity must also disclose 
sufficient information to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue 
and cash flows arising from contracts with customers, including qualitative and quantitative information about contracts with 
customers, significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract. 
In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Deferral of the Effective Date,” which 
deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. Therefore, these provisions are effective for annual reporting periods 
beginning after December 15, 2017 (October 1, 2018 for us), including interim periods within that annual period, and can be 
applied using a full retrospective or modified retrospective approach. The FASB has clarified this guidance in various updates 
(ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10, ASU 2016-12, ASU 2016-20 and ASU 2017-05) since May 2014, all of which have the same 
effective date as the original guidance. We are evaluating the impact of these provisions. We will adopt the revenue standard as 
of October 1, 2018 and currently expect to use the modified retrospective approach. We manufacture certain products that have 
no alternative use to us (since such products are made to specific customer orders), and we believe for certain customers we have 
a legally enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date on these manufactured products including a reasonable 
profit. For those manufactured products that meet these two criteria, we will recognize revenue “over time” upon the adoption of 
ASC 606. This could result in (a) revenue recognition prior to the date of shipment or title transfer for these products and (b) an 
increase in unbilled receivables balances and a reduction in finished goods inventory balances on our balance sheet from historic 
and current levels. We are continuing to evaluate the impact of the provisions of the new revenue standard on the Company's 
financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

Note 2.  Earnings per Share

Restricted stock awards we grant to non-employee directors are considered participating securities as they receive non-
forfeitable rights to dividends at the same rate as our Common Stock. As participating securities, we include these instruments in 
the earnings allocation in computing earnings per share under the two-class method described in ASC 260 “Earnings per Share.”

(1)  Net of income attributable to noncontrolling interests of discontinued operations of $4.3 million and $1.4 million for the fiscal 

years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

Weighted average shares include 0.2 million and 0.3 million of reserved, but unissued shares at September 30, 2017 and 2016. 
These reserved shares will be distributed as claims are liquidated or resolved in accordance with the resolution of Smurfit-Stone 
bankruptcy claims.

Options and restricted stock in the amount of 0.7 million, 1.6 million and 0.4 million common shares in fiscal 2017, 2016
and 2015, respectively, were not included in computing diluted earnings per share because the effect would have been antidilutive. 
The dilutive impact of the remaining awards outstanding in each year were included in the effect of dilutive securities.

It is impracticable to segregate the LIFO reserve between raw materials, finished goods and work in process. In fiscal 2017, 
we had no LIFO layer liquidations. In fiscal 2016 and 2015, we reduced inventory quantities in some of our LIFO pools. These 
reductions result in liquidations of LIFO inventory quantities generally carried at lower costs prevailing in prior years as compared 
with the cost of the purchases in the respective fiscal years, the effect of which typically decreases cost of goods sold. The impact 
of the liquidations in fiscal 2016 and 2015 was not significant.

Note 6.  Merger, Acquisitions and Investment

Hannapak Acquisition

On August 1, 2017, we completed the Hannapak Acquisition in a stock purchase. Hanna Group is one of Australia’s leading 
providers of folding cartons to a variety of markets, including beverage, food, confectionery, and healthcare. We expect this 
acquisition will build on our established and growing packaging business in the region. The purchase consideration for the Hannapak 
Acquisition was $59.4 million, net of cash received of $0.6 million and an unreceived working capital settlement of $2.4 million. 
We have included the financial results of the acquired assets since the date of the acquisition in our Consumer Packaging segment. 

The preliminary allocation of consideration primarily included $14.5 million of customer relationship intangible assets, $20.1 
million of goodwill, $13.9 million of property, plant and equipment and $7.1 million of liabilities. We are amortizing the customer 
relationship intangibles over 13 years based on a straight-line basis because the amortization pattern was not reliably determinable.

The fair value assigned to goodwill is primarily attributable to buyer-specific synergies expected to arise after the acquisition (e.g., 
enhanced reach of the combined organization and other synergies), and the assembled work force. The goodwill and intangibles 
are not amortizable for income tax purposes. We are in the process of reviewing the estimated fair values of all assets acquired 
and liabilities assumed, including, among other things, obtaining final valuations of certain tangible and intangible assets as well 
as the fair value of certain contracts and the determination of certain tax balances; thus, the allocation of the purchase price is 
preliminary and subject to revision.

Island Container Acquisition

On July 17, 2017, we completed the Island Container Acquisition in an asset purchase. The assets acquired include a corrugator 
and  corrugated  converting  operations  located  in Wheatley  Heights,  New York,  and  certain  related  fulfillment  assets  located 
in Saddle Brook, New Jersey. We expect this acquisition will enable us to integrate more than 80,000 tons of containerboard 
annually into our Corrugated Packaging segment. The purchase consideration for the Island Container Acquisition was $84.7 
million, including an estimated unpaid working capital settlement of $1.2 million. We have included the financial results of the 
acquired assets since the date of the acquisition in our Corrugated Packaging segment. 

The preliminary allocation of consideration primarily included $43.0 million of customer relationship intangible assets, $27.2 
million of goodwill, $5.4 million of property, plant and equipment and $1.2 million of liabilities. We are amortizing the customer 
relationship intangibles over 8.5 years based on a straight-line basis because the amortization pattern was not reliably determinable. 
The fair value assigned to goodwill is primarily attributable to buyer-specific synergies expected to arise after the acquisition (e.g., 
enhanced reach of the combined organization and other synergies), and the assembled work force. The goodwill and intangibles 
are amortizable for income tax purposes. We are in the process of reviewing the estimated fair values of all assets acquired and 
liabilities assumed, including, among other things, obtaining final third-party valuations of certain tangible and intangible assets 
as well as the fair value of certain contracts and the determination of certain tax balances; thus, the allocation of the purchase price 
is preliminary and subject to revision.

MPS Acquisition

On June 6, 2017, we completed the MPS Acquisition in a stock purchase. MPS is a global provider of print-based specialty 
packaging solutions and its differentiated product offering includes premium folding cartons, inserts, labels and rigid packaging. 
We acquired the outstanding shares of MPS for $18.00 per share in cash and the assumption of debt. We believe this acquisition 
increases annual paperboard consumption by approximately 225,000 tons, of which we expect 35% to 45% to be supplied by us.

In connection with the MPS Acquisition, we paid cash of $1,351.1 million, net of cash received of $47.5 million. The purchase 
consideration included the assumption of $929.1 million of debt and $1.9 million related to MPS equity awards that were replaced 
with WestRock equity awards with identical terms for the pre-acquisition service. The amount related to post-acquisition service 
is being expensed over the remaining service period of the awards. See “Note 17. Share-Based Compensation” for additional 
information on the converted awards. We have included the financial results of MPS since the date of the acquisition in our 
Consumer Packaging segment.

 
The  preliminary  allocation  of  consideration  primarily  included  $1,017.6  million  of  intangible  assets,  $887.7  million  of 
goodwill, $486.3 million of property, plant and equipment and $1,554.7 million of liabilities and noncontrolling interests, including 
debt and deferred income taxes. The fair value assigned to goodwill is primarily attributable to buyer-specific synergies expected 
to arise after the acquisition (e.g., enhanced reach of the combined organization and other synergies), the assembled work force, 
as well as due to establishing deferred taxes for the difference between book and tax basis of the assets and liabilities acquired. 
The goodwill and intangibles are not amortizable for income tax purposes. We are in the process of reviewing the estimated fair 
values of all assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including, among other things, obtaining final third-party valuations of certain 
tangible and intangible assets as well as the fair value of certain contracts and the determination of certain tax balances; thus, the 
allocation of the purchase price is preliminary and subject to revision.

None of the intangibles has significant residual value. We are amortizing the customer relationship intangibles over estimated 
useful lives ranging from 13 to 16 years based on a straight-line basis because the amortization pattern was not reliably determinable.

U.S. Corrugated Acquisition

On June 9, 2017, we completed the U.S. Corrugated Acquisition in a stock purchase. We acquired five corrugated converting 
facilities in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Louisiana that provide a comprehensive suite of products and services to customers in a variety 
of end markets, including food & beverage, pharmaceuticals and consumer electronics. We believe the acquisition will enable us 
to increase the vertical integration of our Corrugated Packaging segment by approximately 105,000 tons of containerboard annually 
through the acquired facilities and another 50,000 tons under a long-term supply contract with another company owned by the 
seller.

The purchase consideration was $193.7 million, net of cash received of $1.4 million and an unreceived working capital 
settlement of $3.4 million. The consideration included the issuance of 2.4 million shares of Common Stock valued at $136.1 
million. We have included the financial results of the acquired assets since the date of the acquisition in our Corrugated Packaging 
segment. 

The preliminary allocation of consideration primarily included $77.8 million of customer relationship intangible assets, $108.2 
million of goodwill, $30.0 million of property, plant and equipment and $53.2 million of liabilities, including deferred income 
taxes. We are amortizing the customer relationship intangibles over 7.5 years based on a straight-line basis because the amortization 
pattern was not reliably determinable. The fair value assigned to goodwill is primarily attributable to buyer-specific synergies 
expected to arise after the acquisition (e.g., enhanced reach of the combined organization and other synergies), and the assembled 
work force, as well as due to establishing deferred taxes for the difference between book and tax basis of the assets and liabilities 
acquired. The goodwill and intangibles are not amortizable for income tax purposes. We are in the process of reviewing the estimated 
fair values of all assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including, among other things, obtaining final third-party valuations of 
certain tangible and intangible assets as well as the fair value of certain contracts and the determination of certain tax balances; 
thus, the allocation of the purchase price is preliminary and subject to revision.

Star Pizza Acquisition

On March 13, 2017, we completed the Star Pizza Acquisition. The transaction provides us with a leadership position in the 
fast growing small-run pizza box market and increases our vertical integration. The purchase price was $34.6 million, net of a $0.7 
million working capital settlement. We have included the financial results of the acquired assets since the date of the acquisition 
in our Corrugated Packaging segment.

The  preliminary  purchase  price  allocation  for  the  acquisition  primarily  included  $24.8  million  of  customer  relationship 
intangible assets and $2.2 million of goodwill. We are amortizing the customer relationship intangibles over 10 years based on a 
straight-line basis because the amortization pattern was not reliably determinable. The fair value assigned to goodwill is primarily 
attributable to buyer-specific synergies expected to arise after the acquisition (e.g., enhanced reach of the combined organization 
and other synergies), and the assembled work force. We expect the goodwill and intangibles to be amortizable for income tax 
purposes. We are in the process of reviewing the estimated fair values of all assets acquired and liabilities assumed; thus, the 
allocation of the purchase price is preliminary and subject to revision.

Grupo Gondi Investment

On April 1, 2016, we completed the formation of a joint venture with Grupo Gondi in Mexico. We contributed $175.0 million 
in cash and the stock of an entity that owns three corrugated packaging facilities in Mexico in return for a 25.0% equity participation 
in the joint venture together with future put and call rights. The investment was valued at approximately $0.3 billion. The joint 
venture operates paper machines, corrugated packaging and high graphic folding carton facilities across various production sites. 
The majority equity holders manage the joint venture and we provide technical and commercial resources and supply certain 
paperboard to the joint venture. We believe the joint venture will help grow our presence in the attractive Mexican market. As a 
result of the transaction, we recorded a pre-tax non-cash gain of $12.1 million included in “Interest income and other income 
(expense), net” on our Consolidated Statements of Operations in fiscal 2016. The transaction includes future put and call rights 
with respect to the respective parties’ ownership interest in the joint venture. We have included the financial results of the joint 
venture since the date of the formation in our Corrugated Packaging segment, and are accounting for the investment under the 
equity method. In the third quarter of fiscal 2017, the joint venture entity had a stock redemption from a minority partner. As a 
result, our equity participation in the joint venture increased to approximately 27.0%. The transaction continues to include future 
put and call rights with respect to the respective parties’ ownership interest in the joint venture. See “Note 23. Subsequent Events 
(Unaudited) — Grupo Gondi Investment” for recent developments.

Packaging Acquisition 

On January 19, 2016, we completed the Packaging Acquisition. The entities acquired provide value-added folding carton and 
litho-laminated display packaging solutions. The purchase price was $94.1 million, net of cash received of $1.7 million, a working 
capital settlement and a $3.5 million escrow receipt in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The transaction is subject to an election 
under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code that increases the U.S. tax basis in the acquired U.S. entities. We believe the transaction has 
provided us with attractive and complementary customers, markets and facilities. We have included the financial results of the 
acquired entities since the date of the acquisition in our Consumer Packaging segment. 

The purchase price allocation for the acquisition primarily included $55.0 million of property, plant and equipment, $10.5 
million of customer relationship intangible assets, $9.3 million of goodwill and $25.8 million of liabilities, including $1.3 million 
of debt. We are amortizing the customer relationship intangibles over estimated useful lives ranging from 9 to 15 years based on 
a straight-line basis because the amortization pattern was not reliably determinable. The fair value assigned to goodwill is primarily 
attributable to buyer-specific synergies expected to arise after the acquisition (e.g., enhanced reach of the combined organization 
and other synergies), and the assembled work force. The goodwill and intangibles of the U.S. entities are amortizable for income 
tax purposes. 

SP Fiber

On October 1, 2015, completed the SP Fiber Acquisition in a stock purchase. The transaction included the acquisition of mills 
located in Dublin, GA and Newberg, OR, which produce lightweight recycled containerboard and kraft and bag paper. The Newberg 
mill also produced newsprint. As part of the transaction, we also acquired SP Fiber's 48% interest in GPS. GPS is a joint venture 
providing steam to the Dublin mill and electricity to Georgia Power. The purchase price was $278.8 million, net of cash received 
of $9.2 million and a working capital settlement. In addition, we paid $36.5 million for debt owed by GPS and thereby own the 
majority of the debt issued by GPS.

The Dublin mill has helped balance the fiber mix of our mill system, including our ability to serve the increasing demand for 
lighter weight containerboard, and the addition of kraft and bag paper has diversified our product offering. Subsequent to the 
transaction, we announced the permanent closure of the Newberg mill due to the decline in market conditions of the newsprint 
business and our need to balance supply and demand in our containerboard system. We determined GPS should be consolidated 
as a variable interest entity under ASC 810 “Consolidation”. Our evaluation concluded that WestRock is the primary beneficiary 
of GPS as WestRock has both the power and benefits as defined by ASC 810. We have included the financial results of SP Fiber 
and GPS since the date of the acquisition in our Corrugated Packaging segment. 

The purchase price allocation for the acquisition primarily included $324.8 million of property, plant and equipment, $13.5 
million of customer relationship intangible assets, $57.3 million of goodwill, and $150.3 million of liabilities and noncontrolling 
interests, including $13.7 million of debt primarily owed by GPS to third parties. We are amortizing the customer relationship 
intangibles over 20 years based on a straight-line basis because the amortization pattern was not reliably determinable. The fair

value assigned to goodwill is primarily attributable to buyer-specific synergies expected to arise after the acquisition (e.g., enhanced 
reach of the combined organization and other synergies), the assembled work force of SP Fiber as well as due to establishing 
deferred taxes for the difference between the book to tax basis of the assets and liabilities acquired. The goodwill and intangibles 
are not amortizable for income tax purposes.

The Combination

On July 1, 2015, pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, RockTenn and MWV completed a strategic combination 
of their respective businesses. Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, RockTenn and MWV each became wholly-owned 
subsidiaries of WestRock. RockTenn was the accounting acquirer. We believe the Combination combined two industry leaders to 
create a leading global provider of consumer and corrugated packaging solutions. 

The consideration for the Combination was $8,286.7 million. In connection with the Combination, RockTenn shareholders 
received in the aggregate approximately 130.4 million shares of Common Stock and approximately $667.8 million in cash. At the 
effective time of the Combination, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of MWV issued and outstanding 
immediately prior to the effective time of the Combination was converted into the right to receive 0.78 shares of Common Stock. 
In the aggregate, MWV stockholders received approximately 131.2 million shares of our Common Stock (which includes shares 
issued  under  certain  MWV  equity  awards  that  vested  as  a  result  of  the  Combination). Included  in  the  consideration  was 
approximately $210.9 million related to outstanding MWV equity awards that were replaced with WestRock equity awards with 
identical terms for pre-Combination service. The amount related to post-Combination service is being expensed over the remaining 
service period of the awards.

(1)  The measurement period adjustments recorded in fiscal 2016 did not have a significant impact on our consolidated 
statements of operations for fiscal 2016 or 2015. In addition, these adjustments did not have a significant impact on 
our consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2015. Therefore, we have recorded the cumulative impact in fiscal 
2016 and have not retrospectively adjusted the comparative 2015 financial information presented herein.

(2)  The measurement period adjustments were due primarily to refinements to third party appraisals and carrying amounts 
of certain assets and liabilities as well as adjustments to certain tax accounts based on, among other things, adjustments 
to deferred tax liabilities, including any appraisal adjustments, analysis of the tax basis of acquired assets and liabilities, 
other tax adjustments and the classification of supplier financing arrangements. The net impact of the measurement 
period adjustments resulted in a net increase to goodwill.

(3)  The net assets acquired include the Specialty Chemicals business, which was separated from WestRock on May 15, 

2016. See “Note 7. Discontinued Operations” for additional information.

The fair value assigned to goodwill is primarily attributable to buyer-specific synergies expected to arise after the acquisition 
(e.g., enhanced geographic reach of the combined organization, increased vertical integration and other synergistic opportunities), 
the assembled work force of MWV as well as due to establishing deferred tax liabilities for the assets and liabilities acquired. The 
goodwill  and  intangibles  resulting  from  the  acquisition  will  not  be  amortizable  for  tax  purposes.  See  “Note  21.  Segment 
Information” for the allocation of goodwill.

None of the intangibles has significant residual value. The intangibles are expected to be amortized over estimated useful 
lives ranging from 1 to 20 years based on the approximate pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed or straight-line 
if the pattern was not reliably determinable.

The allocation of the consideration for the Combination also includes, among other things, $38.5 million of liabilities for 
unfavorable contracts which will be amortized over 1 to 9 years. In connection with purchase accounting, we increased the carrying 
value of the debt assumed by $364.5 million, including $18.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 to increase the carrying 
value of the debt assumed to fair value. The fair value adjustment will be amortized over the life of the instruments, ranging from 
1 to 32 years.

The following unaudited pro forma information reflects our consolidated results of operations as if the Combination had taken

Fiscal 2015 revenues associated with the MWV operations received in the Combination since the closing date were $1,067.1 
million. Disclosure of earnings associated with these operations since the closing date for fiscal 2015 is not practicable as it is not 
being operated as a standalone business.

The unaudited pro forma financial information presented in the table above has been adjusted to give effect to adjustments 
that are (1) directly related to the business combination; (2) factually supportable; and (3) expected to have a continuing impact. 
These adjustments include, but are not limited to, the application of our accounting policies; elimination of related party transactions; 
depreciation and amortization related to fair value adjustments to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets including 
contracts assumed; and interest expense on acquisition related debt.

Unaudited pro forma earnings for fiscal 2015 were adjusted to exclude $126.7 million of acquisition related costs which 
primarily consist of advisory, legal, accounting, valuation, other professional or consulting fees and change in control related 
acceleration of share-based compensation, $71.6 million for the expensing of inventory stepped-up in purchase accounting, net of 
related LIFO impact and $2.6 million of loss on extinguishment of debt. Included in earnings for fiscal 2015 are $75.5 million of 
integration related costs related to the Combination which primarily consist of severance and other employee costs and professional 
services. In fiscal 2017, we recategorized our integration costs to exclude severance and other employee costs. These costs have 
now been presented as restructuring costs. We recategorized $48.2 million related to fiscal 2015. See “Note 9. Restructuring and 
Other Costs, Net”.

Note 7.  Discontinued Operations

On May 15, 2016, WestRock completed the Separation. We distributed 100% of the outstanding common stock, par value 
$0.01 per share, of Ingevity, then a wholly-owned subsidiary of WestRock, to WestRock’s stockholders of record as of the close 
of business on May 4, 2016, with such stockholders receiving one share of Ingevity common stock for every six shares of Common 
Stock held as of such record date. Since the Separation, we have not beneficially owned any shares of Ingevity common stock and 
Ingevity has been an independent public company trading under the symbol “NGVT” on the NYSE. We disposed of the former 
Specialty Chemicals segment in its entirety and ceased to consolidate its assets, liabilities and results of operations. Accordingly, 
we have presented the financial position and results of operations of our former Specialty Chemicals segment as discontinued 
operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.

In connection with the Separation, we and Ingevity entered into a separation and distribution agreement as well as various 
other agreements that provide a framework for the relationships between the parties going forward, including among others a tax 
matters agreement, a lease and ground service agreement with respect to our Covington, Virginia facility, an intellectual property 
agreement, a crude tall oil and black liquor soap skimming supply agreement, a trust agreement, an employee matters agreement 
and a transition service agreement. These agreements provided for the allocation between us and Ingevity of assets, employees, 
liabilities and obligations attributable to periods prior to, at and after the Separation and govern certain relationships between us 
and Ingevity after the Separation. 

Prior to the Separation, Ingevity, then a wholly-owned subsidiary of WestRock, borrowed $500.0 million in contemplation of 
the Separation and distributed the majority of these funds to WestRock, which used the funds to pay down debt. In addition, Ingevity 
assumed an $80.0 million, 7.67% capital lease obligation due January 15, 2027 owed to the City of Wickliffe, KY. In contemplation 
of the Separation, Ingevity also funded a trust in the amount of $68.9 million to secure the balloon principal payment of the capital 
lease upon the lease’s maturity. We remain a co-obligor on the capital lease obligation; therefore, the capital lease assumed by 
Ingevity remains recorded in our consolidated financial statements in long-term debt. At the time of the Separation, we recorded 
a $108.2 million long-term asset for the estimated fair value of the future principal and interest payments on the capital lease 
obligation assumed by Ingevity. The value of the long-term asset and the long-term debt under the lease will reduce over the life 
of the lease using the effective interest method. The $500.0 million of debt and the $68.9 million in the trust were assumed by 
Ingevity, and removed from our consolidated financial statements as part of our discontinued operations reporting.

compensation expenses. Fiscal 2015 restructuring and other costs, net are primarily associated with costs incurred to support the 
Separation and consist primarily of advisory, legal, accounting and other professional fees.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2016, as part of our evaluation of whether events or changes in circumstances had occurred that 
would indicate whether it was more likely than not that the goodwill of our then-owned Specialty Chemicals reporting unit was 
impaired, we considered factors such as, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, and 
financial performance, including the planned revenue and earnings of the reporting unit. We concluded that an impairment indicator 
had occurred related to the goodwill of the Specialty Chemicals reporting unit and that the indicator was driven by market factors 
subsequent to the Combination.

Accordingly, we performed a “Step 1” goodwill impairment test where we updated the discounted cash flow analysis used to 
determine the reporting unit’s initial fair value on July 1, 2015. We also compared those results to the valuations performed by our 
investment bankers in connection with the planned separation of our Specialty Chemicals business. Based on the results of the 
impairment test and analysis, we concluded that the fair value of the Specialty Chemicals reporting unit was less than its carrying 
amount and began a “Step 2” goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss, if any. As part of the analysis, 
we determined that the carrying value of the property, plant and equipment and intangibles, all of which have finite lives, on a 
“held and used” basis did not exceed the estimated undiscounted future cash flows.

In light of changing market conditions, expected revenue and earnings of the reporting unit, lower comparative market 
valuations for companies in Specialty Chemicals’ peer group and our preliminary “Step 2” test, we concluded that an impairment 
of the Specialty Chemicals reporting unit was probable and could be reasonably estimated. As a result, we recorded a pre-tax and 
after-tax non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $478.3 million. This amount is included in the line item “Loss from discontinued 
operations” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. No tax benefit was recorded for the goodwill impairment.

Until the completion of the Separation, GAAP required us to assess impairment of the Specialty Chemicals’ long-lived assets 
using the “held and used” model which was based on undiscounted future cash flows. Under this model, if the expected cash flows 
over the life of the primary asset of the reporting unit were in excess of the carrying amount, then there would be no impairment. 
At the date of the Separation, we assessed Specialty Chemical’s assets for potential impairment using the “held for sale” model. 
This model compares the fair value of the disposal unit to its carrying value and if the fair value less cost to sell is lower, then an 
impairment loss would be recorded. At the date of the Separation, we evaluated the Specialty Chemical’s intangibles, which 
consisted predominantly of customer list intangibles, for impairment. Our analysis at May 15, 2016, using the income approach 
(multi-period excess earnings method), indicated that there was a $101.1 million pre-tax non-cash impairment of our Specialty 
Chemicals customer relationships intangible. The impairment loss was recorded on the Separation and is included as a component 
of discontinued operations.

The following table presents the significant non-cash items and capital expenditures for Specialty Chemicals’ that are included 

in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (in millions):

Note 8.  Assets Held For Sale

During the second quarter of fiscal 2017, we committed to a plan to sell HH&B. On January 23, 2017, we announced we had 
entered into an agreement with certain subsidiaries of Silgan under which Silgan would purchase HH&B for approximately $1.025 
billion in cash plus the assumption of approximately $25 million in foreign pension liabilities. Accordingly, in the second quarter 
of fiscal 2017, all of the assets and liabilities of HH&B were reported as assets and liabilities held for sale. We discontinued 
recording depreciation and amortization while the assets were held for sale. On April 6, 2017, we announced that we had completed 

87

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the HH&B Sale. We used the proceeds from the HH&B Sale in connection with the MPS Acquisition. We recorded a pre-tax gain 
on sale of HH&B of $192.8 million in fiscal 2017.

 
Due to the accelerated monetization strategy, our Land and Development portfolio has met the held for sale criteria and is 
reflected as assets held for sale. Assets held for sale at September 30, 2017 of $173.6 million include $150.4 million of Land and 
Development portfolio assets, with the remainder primarily related to closed facilities. As of September 30, 2016, the $52.3 million
of assets held for sale were primarily related to assets under contract in our Land and Development segment.

Note 9.  Restructuring and Other Costs, Net

Summary of Restructuring and Other Initiatives

We recorded pre-tax restructuring and other costs, net, of $196.7 million, $366.4 million and $140.8 million for fiscal 2017, 
2016 and 2015, respectively. Of these costs, $86.6 million, $200.2 million and $13.4 million were non-cash for fiscal 2017, 2016
and 2015, respectively. These amounts, which are outlined below, are not comparable since the timing and scope of the individual 
actions associated with each restructuring, acquisition, divestiture or integration can vary. The restructuring and other costs, net, 
exclude the Specialty Chemicals costs which are included in discontinued operations. We present our restructuring and other costs, 
net in more detail below and those charged to discontinued operations in “Note 7. Discontinued Operations”.

The following table summarizes our Restructuring and other costs, net for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 (in millions):

Restructuring

Our restructuring charges are primarily associated with plant closures and employee costs due to merger and acquisition-
related workforce reductions. When we close a facility, if necessary, we recognize an impairment charge primarily to reduce the 
carrying value of equipment or other property to their estimated fair value less cost to sell, and record charges for severance and 
other employee-related costs. Any subsequent change in fair value less cost to sell prior to disposition is recognized as identified; 
however, no gain is recognized in excess of the cumulative loss previously recorded. At the time of each announced closure, we 
generally expect to record future period costs for equipment relocation, facility carrying costs, costs to terminate a lease or contract 
before the end of its term and employee-related costs.

Although specific circumstances vary, our strategy has generally been to consolidate our sales and operations into large well-
equipped plants that operate at high utilization rates and take advantage of available capacity created by operational excellence 
initiatives and/or further optimize our system following mergers and acquisitions or a changing business environment. Therefore, 
we have transferred a substantial portion of each closed plant’s assets and production to our other plants. We believe these actions 
have allowed us to more effectively manage our business. In our Land and Development segment, the restructuring charges primarily 
relate to severance and other employee costs associated with the accelerated monetization strategy and wind down of operations.

While restructuring costs are not charged to our segments and, therefore, do not reduce segment income, we highlight the 
segment to which the charges relate. The following table presents a summary of restructuring charges related to active restructuring 
initiatives that we incurred during the last three fiscal years, the cumulative recorded amount since we started the initiative, and 
our estimate of the total we expect to incur (in millions):

Other Costs

Our other costs consist of acquisition, divestiture and integration costs. We incur costs when we acquire or divest businesses. 
Acquisition costs include costs associated with transactions, whether consummated or not, such as advisory, legal, accounting, 
valuation and other professional or consulting fees, as well as potential litigation costs associated with those activities. Divestiture 
costs consist primarily of similar professional fees. The divestiture costs in fiscal 2017 are primarily associated with costs incurred 
during the HH&B Sale process. Post-acquisition, we incur integration costs that reflect work being performed to facilitate merger 
and  acquisition  integration,  such  as  work  associated  with  information  systems  and  other  projects,  and  primarily  consist  of 
professional services. We consider acquisition, divestiture and integration costs to be Corporate costs regardless of the segment 
or segments involved in the transaction.

The following table presents our acquisition, divestiture and integration costs that we incurred during the last three fiscal years 

(in millions):

 Debt 

In connection with the Combination, the public bonds issued by WestRock RKT Company and WestRock MWV, LLC are 
guaranteed by WestRock and have cross-guarantees between the two companies. The IDBs associated with the capital lease 
obligations of WestRock MWV, LLC are guaranteed by WestRock. The public bonds are unsecured, unsubordinated obligations 
that rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured, unsubordinated obligations. The bonds are 
effectively subordinated to any of our existing and future secured debt to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt. 
At September 30, 2017, our Credit Facility, Farm Credit Facility and public bonds were unsecured.

A portion of the debt classified as long-term, principally our Credit Facility and Receivables Facility, may be paid down earlier 
than scheduled at our discretion without penalty. Certain restrictive covenants govern our maximum availability under our credit 
facilities. We test and report our compliance with these covenants as required and were in compliance with all of our covenants 
at September 30, 2017. The carrying value of our debt includes the fair value step-up of debt acquired in mergers and acquisitions. 
At September 30, 2017, the unamortized fair market value step-up was $281.8 million, which will be amortized over a weighted 
average remaining life of 12.7 years. The weighted average interest rate also includes the fair value step up. Excluding the step-
up, the weighted average interest rate on total debt was 4.1%. At September 30, 2017, we had $114.6 million of outstanding letters 
of credit not drawn upon. At September 30, 2017, we had approximately $2.9 billion of availability under our committed credit 
facilities and approximately $0.1 billion available under our uncommitted credit facilities. This liquidity, may be used to provide 
for ongoing working capital needs and for other general corporate purposes including acquisitions, dividends and stock repurchases. 
The estimated fair value of our debt was approximately $6.8 billion and $6.0 billion as of September 30, 2017 and September 30, 
2016, respectively. The fair value of our long-term debt is primarily either based on quoted prices for those or similar instruments 
or approximate the carrying amount as the variable interest rates reprice frequently at observable current market rates and are 
categorized as level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. During fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 amortization of debt issuance costs 
charged to interest expense were $4.5 million, $4.6 million and $9.3 million, respectively.

Public Bonds 

On August 24, 2017, we issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.0% Senior Notes due September 15, 2024 
and $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.375% Senior Notes due September 15, 2027 in an unregistered offering 
pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act at a discount of approximately $1.4 million and $0.2 million, 
respectively, and recorded debt issuance costs of $4.2 million and $4.3 million, respectively, which are being amortized over the 
respective terms of the notes. Giving effect to the amortization of the original issue discount and the debt issuance costs, the 
effective interest rates of the notes are 3.18% and 3.48%, respectively. The proceeds from the issuance of the notes was used to 
pre-pay $575.0 million of amortization payments through the maturity of our term loan and $415.0 million then outstanding on 
the Receivables Facility. At September 30, 2017 and September 30, 2016, the face value of our public bond obligations outstanding 
were $3.8 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively. 

Term Loan Facilities and Revolving Credit Facility

In connection with the Combination, on July 1, 2015, we entered into the Credit Agreement, which provided for a 5-year 
senior unsecured term loan in an aggregate principal amount of $2.3 billion and a 5-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility 
in an aggregate committed principal amount of $2.0 billion (together the “Credit Facility”). On July 1, 2015, we drew $1.2 billion
of the $2.3 billion unsecured term loan and $1.1 billion was available to be drawn on a delayed draw basis not later than April 1, 
2016 in up to two separate draws. Certain proceeds of the Credit Facility were used to repay certain indebtedness of our subsidiaries 
at the time of the Combination, including the then existing RockTenn credit facility, and to pay fees and expenses incurred in 
connection with the Combination. The Credit Facility is unsecured and is guaranteed by WestRock’s wholly-owned subsidiaries 
WestRock RKT Company and WestRock MWV, LLC. On March 24, 2016, we drew $600.0 million of the then available $1.1 
billion delayed draw term loan facility for general corporate purposes and the balance of the delayed draw term loan facility was 
terminated. On June 22, 2016, we pre-paid $200.0 million of the term loan amortization payments due through the second quarter 
of fiscal 2018. On August 24, 2017, in connection with the issuance of public bonds, we pre-paid $575.0 million of the term loan 
amortization payments due through the maturity of the term loan. The carrying value of this term loan facility at September 30, 
2017 and September 30, 2016 was $1,023.5 million and $1,596.7 million, respectively.

On July 1, 2016, we executed an option to extend the term of the 5-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility for one 
year beyond the original term. On June 30, 2017, we executed an option to extend the term of the facility for a second additional 
year. Approximately $1.9 billion of the original $2.0 billion aggregate committed principal amount has been extended to July 1, 
2022, and the remainder will continue to mature on July 1, 2020. Up to $150 million under the revolving credit facility may be 
used for the issuance of letters of credit. In addition, up to $400 million of the revolving credit facility may be used to fund 
borrowings in non-U.S. dollar currencies including Canadian dollars, Euro and Pound Sterling. Additionally, we may request up 
to $200 million of the revolving credit facility to be allocated to a Mexican peso revolving credit facility. At September 30, 2017
and September 30, 2016, we had no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility.

At our option, loans issued under the Credit Facility will bear interest at either LIBOR or an alternate base rate, in each case 
plus an applicable interest rate margin. Loans will initially bear interest at LIBOR plus 1.125% per annum, in the case of LIBOR 
borrowings, or at the alternate base rate plus 0.125% per annum, in the alternative, and thereafter the interest rate will fluctuate 
between LIBOR plus 1.00% per annum and LIBOR plus 1.50% per annum (or between the alternate base rate plus 0.00% per 
annum and the alternate base rate plus 0.50% per annum), based upon our corporate credit ratings or the leverage ratio (as defined 
in the Credit Agreement) (whichever yields a lower applicable interest rate margin) at such time. In addition, we will be required 
to pay fees that will fluctuate between 0.125% per annum to 0.25% per annum on the unused amount of the revolving credit facility, 
based upon our corporate credit ratings or the leverage ratio (whichever yields a lower fee) at such time. Loans under the Credit 
Facility may be prepaid at any time without premium.

The Credit Agreement contains usual and customary representations and warranties, and usual and customary affirmative and 
negative covenants, including: financial covenants (including maintenance of a maximum consolidated debt to capitalization ratio 
and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement) and limitations on liens, additional 
indebtedness and asset sales and mergers. The Credit Agreement also contains usual and customary events of default, including: 
non-payment of principal, interest, fees and other amounts; material breach of a representation or warranty; default on other material 
debt;  bankruptcy  or  insolvency;  incurrence  of  certain  material  ERISA  liabilities;  material  judgments;  impairment  of  loan 
documentation; change of control; and material breach of obligations under securitization programs.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

On July 1, 2015, we entered into the Farm Loan Credit Agreement that provides for a 7-year senior unsecured term loan in 
an aggregate principal amount of $600.0 million. The Farm Credit Facility is guaranteed by WestRock, RockTenn and MWV. The 
carrying value of this facility at September 30, 2017 and September 30, 2016 was $599.2 million and $599.0 million, respectively.

On December 1, 2015, we entered into a $200.0 million uncommitted and revolving line of credit with Sumitomo Mitsui 
Banking Corporation that matured on December 1, 2016. We renewed the facility on February 10, 2017, and it now matures on 
February 12, 2018. The carrying value of this facility at September 30, 2017 was $106.7 million. At September 30, 2016, we had 
no amounts outstanding. 

 On February 11, 2016, we entered into a $100.0 million uncommitted and revolving line of credit with the Bank of Tokyo-
Mitsubishi UFJ, LTD. The facility matured on February 9, 2017, and was not renewed. At September 30, 2016, we had no amounts 
outstanding under this facility. 

On March 4, 2016, we entered into a $100.0 million uncommitted and revolving line of credit with Cooperatieve Rabobank 
U.A., New York Branch. The facility matured on March 2, 2017 and was renewed as a Euro dollar facility on the same day. The 
facility is an uncommitted revolving line of credit in the amount of €100.0 million. The facility will be available in Euros only, 
and continues until terminated in writing by WestRock or the lender. The carrying value of this facility at September 30, 2017 was 
$118.1 million. At September 30, 2016, we had no amounts outstanding. 

On May 15, 2017, we entered into a $600.0 million European revolving credit facility with Coöperatieve Rabobank U.A., 
New York Branch as the administrative agent for the syndicate of banks. This facility provides for a 364-day unsecured Euro and 
Sterling denominated borrowing of not more than $200.0 million and $400.0 million U.S. dollar equivalent, respectively. The 
facility matures on May 14, 2018. The carrying value of this facility at September 30, 2017 was $211.6 million.

Receivables-Backed Financing Facility

We have a $700.0 million Receivables Facility. On July 22, 2016, we extended the maturity date to July 22, 2019. The credit 
spread for the used portion of the facility is 0.85%. The Receivables Facility includes certain restrictions on what constitutes 
eligible receivables under the facility and allows for the exclusion of eligible receivables of specific obligors each calendar year 
subject to the following restrictions: (i) the aggregate of excluded receivables may not exceed 7.5% of eligible receivables under 
the Receivables Facility, and (ii) the excluded receivables of each obligor may not exceed 2.5% of the aggregate outstanding 
balance. The borrowing rate, which consists of a blend of the market rate for asset-backed commercial paper and the one month 
LIBOR rate plus a utilization fee, was 2.2% and 1.4% as of September 30, 2017 and September 30, 2016, respectively. The 
commitment fee was 0.25% and 0.25% as of September 30, 2017 and September 30, 2016, respectively.

Borrowing availability under this facility is based on the eligible underlying accounts receivable and compliance with certain 
covenants. The agreement governing the Receivables Facility contains restrictions, including, among others, on the creation of 
certain liens on the underlying collateral. We test and report our compliance with these covenants monthly; we were in compliance 
with all of these covenants at September 30, 2017. At September 30, 2017 and September 30, 2016, maximum available borrowings, 
excluding amounts outstanding under the Receivables Facility, were $577.6 million and $584.3 million, respectively. The carrying 
amount of accounts receivable collateralizing the maximum available borrowings at September 30, 2017 was approximately $848.3 
million. We have continuing involvement with the underlying receivables as we provide credit and collections services pursuant 
to  the  Receivables  Facility  agreement.  The  carrying  value  of  this  facility  at  September 30,  2017  was  $110.0  million. At 
September 30, 2016, we had no amounts outstanding.

Capital Lease and Other Indebtedness

The range of due dates on our capital lease obligations are primarily in fiscal 2027 to 2035. Our international debt is primarily

 Fair Value

Assets and Liabilities Measured or Disclosed at Fair Value

We estimate fair values in accordance with ASC 820 “Fair Value Measurement”. ASC 820 provides a framework for measuring 
fair value and expands disclosures required about fair value measurements. Specifically, ASC 820 sets forth a definition of fair 
value and a hierarchy prioritizing the inputs to valuation techniques. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received 
from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an 
orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Additionally, ASC 820 defines levels within the hierarchy 
based on the availability of quoted prices for identical items in active markets, similar items in active or inactive markets and 
valuation techniques using observable and unobservable inputs. We incorporate credit valuation adjustments to reflect both our 
own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty’s nonperformance risk in our fair value measurements.

We disclose the fair value of our long-term debt in “Note 11. Debt” and the fair value of our pension and postretirement assets 
and liabilities in “Note 15. Retirement Plans”. We have, or from time to time may have, various assets or liabilities whose fair 
values are not significant, such as supplemental retirement savings plans that are nonqualified deferred compensation plans pursuant 
to which assets are invested primarily in mutual funds, interest rate derivatives, commodity derivatives or other similar classes of 
assets or liabilities.

Accounts Receivable Sales Agreement

In fiscal 2014, we entered into an agreement, which has been amended periodically, to sell to a third party financial institution 
all of the short-term receivables generated from certain customer trade accounts, on a revolving basis, until the agreement is 
terminated by either party. On June 27, 2016, the A/R Sales Agreement was amended to increase the maximum outstanding balance 
of receivables available to be sold to $400.0 million. On September 29, 2017, the A/R Sales Agreement was amended to increase 
the maximum outstanding balance of receivables available to be sold to $490.0 million, and we added new customer trade accounts 
as well as increased the limits for other customers. Transfers under this agreement meet the requirements to be accounted for as

sales in accordance with guidance in ASC 860, “Transfers and Servicing”. These customers are not included in the Receivables 
Facility.

Cash proceeds related to the receivables sold are included in cash from operating activities in the consolidated statement of 
cash flows in the accounts receivable line item. The loss on sale is not material as it is currently less than 1% per annum of the 
receivables sold, currently approximately $8 million per fiscal year, and is recorded in interest income and other income (expense), 
net. Although the sales are made without recourse, we maintain continuing involvement with the sold receivables as we provide 
collections services related to the transferred assets. The associated servicing liability is not material given the high quality of the 
customers underlying the receivables and the anticipated short collection period. 

Financial Instruments not Recognized at Fair Value

Financial instruments not recognized at fair value on a recurring or nonrecurring basis include cash and cash equivalents, 
accounts receivable, certain other current assets, short-term debt, accounts payable, certain other current liabilities, and long-term 
debt. With the exception of long-term debt, the carrying amounts of these financial instruments approximate their fair values due 
to their short maturities. See “Note 11. Debt” for the fair value of our long-term debt.

Fair Value of Nonfinancial Assets and Nonfinancial Liabilities

We measure certain nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These assets and 
liabilities include cost and equity method investments when they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired, assets acquired 
and liabilities assumed in an acquisition or in a nonmonetary exchange, and property, plant and equipment and intangible assets 
that are written down to fair value when they are held for sale or determined to be impaired. During fiscal 2017 and 2016, we did 
not have any significant nonfinancial assets or nonfinancial liabilities that were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in 
periods subsequent to initial recognition other than the $46.7 million real estate impairment recorded in fiscal 2017 in connection 
with the accelerated monetization strategy in our Land and Development segment, a $17.6 million impairment of a customer 
relationship intangible in fiscal 2017 related to an exited product line, the goodwill impairment of our former Specialty Chemicals 
reporting unit in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 and the intangible impairment in the former Specialty Chemicals segment in the 
third  quarter  of  fiscal  2016  following  the  Separation. We  discuss  the  former  Specialty  Chemicals  impairments  in  “Note  7. 
Discontinued Operations”.

(1)  The long-term deferred tax asset is presented in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

At September 30, 2017 and September 30, 2016, we had gross federal net operating losses of approximately $61.2 million

and $85.3 million, respectively. These loss carryforwards generally expire between fiscal 2030 and 2037. 

At September 30, 2017 and September 30, 2016, we had alternative minimum tax credits of $132.2 million and $185.1 million, 
respectively. Under  current  tax  law,  the  alternative  minimum  tax  credit  carryforwards  do  not  expire.  We  had  research  and 
development tax credits and general business credits of $3.2 million and $0.5 million, respectively, at September 30, 2017. 

At September 30, 2017 and September 30, 2016, we had gross state and local net operating losses, of approximately $1,885 
million and $1,899 million, respectively. These loss carryforwards generally expire between fiscal 2018 and 2037. The tax effected 
values of these net operating losses are $70.6 million and $82.3 million at September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, exclusive 
of valuation allowances of $15.9 million and $14.2 million at September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

At September 30, 2017 and September 30, 2016, gross net operating losses for foreign reporting purposes of approximately 
$673.7 million and $448.7 million, respectively, were available for carryforward. A majority of these loss carryforwards generally 
expire between fiscal 2018 and 2037, while a portion have an indefinite carryforward. The tax effected values of these net operating 
losses are $182.6 million and $119.3 million at September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, exclusive of valuation allowances of 
$149.6 million and $92.5 million at September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 

At September 30, 2017 and 2016, we had state tax credit carryforwards of $54.4 million and $56.1 million, respectively. These 
state tax credit carryforwards generally expire within 5 to 10 years; however, certain state credits can be carried forward indefinitely. 
Valuation allowances of $47.3 million and $51.2 million at September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, have been provided on 
these assets. These valuation allowances have been recorded due to uncertainty regarding our ability to generate sufficient taxable 
income in the appropriate taxing jurisdiction.

2015 (in millions):

Consistent with prior years, we consider a portion of our earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries as subject to repatriation 
and we provide for taxes accordingly. However, we consider the unremitted earnings and all other outside differences from all 
other foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested. Accordingly, we have not provided for any taxes that would be due.

As of September 30, 2017, we estimate our outside basis difference in foreign subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely 
reinvested to be approximately $2.3 billion. The components of the outside basis difference are comprised of purchase accounting 
adjustments, undistributed earnings, and equity components. We have not provided for any taxes that would be due upon the 
reversal of the outside basis differences. However, in the event of a distribution in the form of dividends or dispositions of the 
subsidiaries, we may be subject to incremental U.S. income taxes, subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits, and withholding 
taxes or income taxes payable to the foreign jurisdictions. As of September 30, 2017, the determination of the deferred tax liability 
is not practicable.

(2)  Reductions due to settlement in fiscal 2017 relate to the settlement of federal and state audit examinations with taxing

As of September 30, 2017 and 2016, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was approximately $148.9 million and 
$166.8 million, respectively, exclusive of interest and penalties. Of these balances, as of September 30, 2017 and 2016, if we were 
to prevail on all unrecognized tax benefits recorded, approximately $138.0 million and $138.6 million, respectively, would benefit 
the effective tax rate. We regularly evaluate, assess and adjust the related liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances, 
which could cause the effective tax rate to fluctuate from period to period.

We recognize estimated interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense in the consolidated 
statements of operations. As of September 30, 2017, we had liabilities of $81.7 million related to estimated interest and penalties 
for unrecognized tax benefits. As of September 30, 2016, we had liabilities of $60.2 million, net of indirect benefits, related to 
estimated interest and penalties for unrecognized tax benefits. Our results of operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 
2017 include expense of $5.4 million related to estimated interest and penalties with respect to the liability for unrecognized tax 
benefits. Our results of operations for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 include expense of $7.4 million and 
$2.9 million, respectively, net of indirect benefits, related to estimated interest and penalties with respect to the liability for 
unrecognized tax benefits. As of September 30, 2017, it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will decrease 
by up to $29.6 million in the next twelve months due to expiration of various statues of limitations and settlement of issues.

We file federal, state and local income tax returns in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, we are 
no longer subject to U.S. federal and state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to fiscal 2014 and 
fiscal 2007, respectively. We are no longer subject to non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to fiscal 
2010, except for Brazil for which we are not subject to tax examinations for years prior to 2004. While we believe our tax positions 
are appropriate, they are subject to audit or other modifications and there can be no assurance that any modifications will not 
materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

Note 15. 

 Retirement Plans 

We have defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans for certain U.S. and non-U.S. employees. Certain 
plans were frozen for salaried and non-union hourly employees at various times in the past, although some employees meeting 
certain criteria are still accruing benefits. In addition, under several labor contracts, we make payments, based on hours worked, 
into MEPP trusts established for the benefit of certain collective bargaining employees in facilities both inside and outside the 
U.S. We also have supplemental executive retirement plans and other non-qualified defined benefit pension plans that provide 
unfunded supplemental retirement benefits to certain of our current and former executives. The supplemental executive retirement 
plans provide for incremental pension benefits in excess of those offered in the Plan. The other postretirement benefit plans provide 
certain health care and life insurance benefits for certain salaried and hourly employees who meet specified age and service 
requirements as defined by the plans.

In connection with the Combination, the Rock-Tenn Company Consolidated Pension Plan and MWV U.S. qualified defined 
benefit pension plans assigned the role of plan sponsor to WestRock. On July 2, 2015, WestRock merged the MWV U.S. qualified 
defined benefit pension plans into the Rock-Tenn Company Consolidated Pension Plan, and renamed the merged plan the WestRock 
Company Consolidated Pension Plan. Upon the merger, the terms and provisions of the legacy MWV plans were incorporated 
into the merged plan.

Additionally, on July 30, 2015, WestRock approved changes to freeze the Plan for the remaining U.S. salaried and non-union 
hourly employees, subject to certain grandfathering. Affected employees accrued a benefit through December 31, 2015, except 
for employees who receive a benefit under the legacy MWV U.S. qualified defined benefit pension portions of the Plan and who 
met the criteria for grandfathering. Those employees who met a minimum age of 50 and an aggregate age and service of 75 years 
or more as of December 31, 2015, are grandfathered and continue to accrue a benefit until December 31, 2020 or their termination 
date, if earlier. The WestRock retirement program for U.S. salaried and non-union hourly employees in place of the Plan is a 
defined contribution benefit plan.

The benefits under our defined benefit pension plans are based on either compensation or a combination of years of service 
and negotiated benefit levels, depending upon the plan. We allocate our pension assets to several investment management firms 
across a variety of investment styles. Our defined benefit Investment Committee meets at least four times a year with our investment

advisors to review each management firm’s performance and monitors its compliance with its stated goals, our investment policy 
and applicable regulatory requirements in the U.S., Canada, and other jurisdictions. 

Investment returns vary. We believe that, by investing in a variety of asset classes and utilizing multiple investment management 
firms, we can create a portfolio that yields adequate returns with reduced volatility. Our qualified U.S. plans employ a liability 
matching strategy augmented with Treasury futures to generally fully hedge against interest rate risk. After we consulted with our 
actuary and investment advisors, we adopted the target allocations in the table that follows for our pension plans to produce the 
desired  performance. These  target  allocations  are  guidelines,  not  limitations,  and  occasionally  plan  fiduciaries  will  approve 
allocations above or below target ranges or modify the allocations.

We manage our retirement plans in accordance with the provisions of ERISA as well as applicable legislation in Canada and 
other  foreign  countries.  Our  investment  policy  objectives  include  maximizing  long-term  returns  at  acceptable  risk  levels, 
diversifying among asset classes, as applicable, and among investment managers, as well as establishing certain risk parameters 
within asset classes. We have allocated our investments within the equity and fixed income asset classes to sub-asset classes 
designed to meet these objectives. In addition, our other investments support multi-strategy objectives. 

In developing our weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets, we consulted with our investment advisors and 
evaluated criteria based on historical returns by asset class and long-term return expectations by asset class. We use a September 
30 measurement date. We expect to contribute approximately $39 million to our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans in fiscal 2018, 
primarily related to our Canadian plans. However, it is possible that our assumptions or legislation may change, actual market 
performance may vary or we may decide to contribute a different amount. Therefore, the amount we contribute may vary materially. 
The expense for MEPPs for collective bargaining employees generally equals the contributions for these plans. 

The weighted average assumptions used to measure the benefit plan obligations at September 30, were:

We determine the discount rate with the assistance of actuaries. At September 30, 2017, the discount rate for the U.S. pension 
plans was determined based on the yield on a theoretical portfolio of high-grade corporate bonds, and the discount rate for the 
non-U.S. plans was determined based on a yield curve developed by our actuary. The theoretical portfolio of high-grade corporate 
bonds used to select the September 30, 2017 discount rate for the U.S. pension plans includes bonds generally rated Aa- or better 
with at least $100 million outstanding par value and bonds that are non-callable (unless the bonds possess a “make whole” feature).  
The theoretical portfolio of bonds has cash flows that generally match our expected benefit payments in future years. 

Our assumption regarding the future rate of compensation increases is reviewed periodically and is based on both our internal 

planning projections and recent history of actual compensation increases. 

We typically review our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets periodically through an asset allocation study with 
either our actuary or investment advisor. In fiscal 2018, our expected rate of return used to determine net periodic benefit cost is 
6.50% for our U.S. plans and 4.98% for our non-U.S. plans. Our expected rates of return in fiscal 2018 are based on an analysis 
of our long-term expected rate of return and our current asset allocation.

During the second quarter of fiscal 2017, our year-to-date lump sum payments to certain beneficiaries of the Plan, together 
with several one-time severance benefit payments out of the Plan, triggered pension settlement accounting and a remeasurement 
of the Plan as of February 28, 2017. As a result of settlement accounting, we recognized as a current period expense a pro-rata 
portion of the unamortized net actuarial loss, after remeasurement, and recorded a $28.7 million non-cash charge to our earnings 
in the second quarter of 2017. The lump sum payments were to certain eligible former employees who were not currently receiving 
a monthly benefit. Eligible former employees whose present value of future pension benefits exceeded a certain minimum threshold 
had the option to either voluntarily accept lump sum payments or to not accept the offer and continue to be entitled to their monthly 
benefit upon retirement. Lump sum and one-time severance benefits payments of $203.7 million were made out of existing assets 
of the Plan in the first half of fiscal 2017. The discount rate used in the plan remeasurement was 4.49%, an increase from 4.04% 
for the Plan at September 30, 2016. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets was unchanged. As a result of the February 
28, 2017 remeasurement, the funded status of the Plan increased by $73.2 million as compared to September 30, 2016. The increase 
in the funded status was primarily due to a reduction in the plan obligations due to the increase in the discount rate. In the second 
half of fiscal 2017, we made $27.1 million in lump sum payments to certain beneficiaries of the Plan, resulting in total fiscal 2017 
lump sum payments of $230.8 million and a total fiscal 2017 non-cash charge to our earnings of $32.6 million.

On September 21, 2016, we used plan assets to settle $2.5 billion in pension obligations of the Plan by purchasing group 
annuity contracts from Prudential. This transaction transferred payment responsibility to Prudential for retirement benefits owed 
to approximately 35,000 U.S. retirees and their beneficiaries. As a result of the transaction, we recorded a non-cash charge of 
$370.7 million pre-tax. The settlement reduced our overall U.S. pension obligations and assets by approximately 40%. The monthly 
retirement benefit payment amounts currently received by retirees and their beneficiaries did not change as a result of this transaction. 
Those Plan participants not included in the transaction remain in the Plan, and responsibility for payment of the retirement benefits 
remains with us.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we partially settled obligations of one of our qualified defined benefit pension plans 
through lump sum payments to certain eligible former employees who were not currently receiving a monthly benefit. Eligible 
former employees whose present value of future pension benefits exceeded a certain minimum threshold had the option to either 
voluntarily accept lump sum payments or to not accept the offer and continue to be entitled to their monthly benefit upon retirement. 
Former employees with an aggregate pension benefit obligation of $163.7 million accepted the offer. Lump sum payments of 
$135.1 million were made out of existing plan assets. The settlement resulted in a gain of $28.6 million that was more than offset 
by the loss on remeasurement of the pension benefit obligation of approximately $32.5 million due primarily to the impact of a 
lower discount rate and mortality table changes. As a result, we recorded a net $3.9 million loss to other comprehensive income. 
The settlement also resulted in a $20.0 million pre-tax non-cash charge to earnings, which is included in the line item “Pension 
lump sum settlement and retiree medical curtailment, net” on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The impact of the 
settlement is included in the net periodic pension cost table below. As a result of the remeasurement, the pension benefit obligation 
increased $22.1 million due to changes in coverage for certain employees covered by the USW master agreement as discussed 
below, with an offset recorded to the unrecognized prior service cost component of other comprehensive income. 

In the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we entered into a master agreement with the USW that applied to substantially all of our 
legacy RockTenn facilities where employees that they represent are employed. The agreement has a six year term and covers a 
number of specific items such as wages, medical coverage and certain other benefit programs. Individual facilities will continue

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Although the U.S. pension plans were in a net over funded position at September 30, 2017, certain U.S. plans have benefit 
obligations  in  excess  of  plan  assets. These  plans  have  aggregate  projected  benefit  obligations  of  $204.6  million,  aggregate 
accumulated benefit obligations of $201.9 million, and aggregate fair value of plan assets of $30.2 million at September 30, 2017.

The  accumulated  benefit  obligation  of  U.S.  and  non-U.S.  pension  plans  was  $5,390.7  million  and  $5,112.0  million  at 

September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

In fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, for our U.S. pension and postretirement plans, we considered the mortality tables from the 
Society of Actuaries and evaluated our mortality experience to establish mortality assumptions. Based on our experience and in 
consultation with our actuaries, we utilized the base RP-2014 mortality tables with a gender and job classification specific increase, 
and applied an improvement scale with generational improvements that is generally based on Social Security Administration 
analysis and assumptions. The increases for fiscal 2017 are 9% for white collar males, 12% for blue collar males, 11% for white 
collar females, and 9% for blue collar females. The increases for fiscal 2016 were 6% for white collar males, 10% for blue collar 
males, 12% for white collar females, and 19% for blue collar females. The increases for fiscal 2015 were 6% for all males, 13% 
for white collar females, and 19% for blue collar females. In fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 our Canadian pension and postretirement 
plans utilized the 2014 Private Sector Canadian Pensioners Mortality Table adjusted to reflect industry and our mortality experience 
and applied Canadian Pensioner’s Mortality Improvement Scale B with generational improvements.

Postretirement Plans

The postretirement benefit plans provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for certain salaried and hourly employees 
who meet specified age and service requirements as defined by the plans. During the first quarter of fiscal 2015, changes in retiree 
medical coverage for certain employees covered by the USW master agreement resulted in the recognition of an estimated $8.1 
million pre-tax non-cash curtailment gain included in the line item “Pension lump sum settlement and retiree medical curtailment, 
net” on our Consolidated Statements of Operations, which was subsequently adjusted in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 to $8.5 
million. The aggregate postretirement benefit obligation decreased $0.6 million as a result of the curtailment.

The weighted average assumptions used to measure the benefit plan obligations at September 30 were:

Multiemployer Plans

We participate in several MEPPs that provide retirement benefits to certain union employees in accordance with various CBAs. 
The risks of participating in MEPPs are different from the risks of participating in single-employer pension plans. These risks 
include:

• 
• 

• 

assets contributed to a MEPP by one employer are used to provide benefits to employees of all participating employers,
if a participating employer withdraws from a MEPP, the unfunded obligations of the MEPP allocable to such withdrawing 
employer may be borne by the remaining participating employers and
if we withdraw from a MEPP, we may be required to pay that plan an amount based on our allocable share of the unfunded 
vested benefits of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability, as well as a share of the MEPP’s accumulated funding 
deficiency.

Our contributions to a particular MEPP are established by the applicable CBAs; however, our required contributions may 
increase based on the funded status of a MEPP and legal requirements, such as those set forth in the Pension Act, which requires 
substantially underfunded MEPPs to implement a FIP or a RP to improve their funded status. Factors that could impact the funded 
status of a MEPP include, without limitation, investment performance, changes in participant demographics, decline in the number 
of contributing employers, changes in actuarial assumptions and the utilization of extended amortization provisions. We believe 
that certain of the MEPPs in which we participate, including the PIUMPF, have material unfunded vested benefits. The Pension 
Act established three categories, or “zones”, for the funded status of plans. Among other factors, plans in the green zone are at 
least 80% funded and are designated as healthy, plans in the yellow zone are greater than 65% but less than 80% funded and are 
designated as endangered and plans in the red zone are generally less than 65% funded and are designated as critical or critical 
and declining. Each plan’s actuary must certify the plan status annually. Several of the MEPPs in which we participate, including 
PIUMPF, have been certified in the red zone for critical and declining. Our share of the contributions in PIUMPF have exceeded 
5% of total plan contributions in recent plan years.

A FIP or RP requires a particular MEPP to adopt measures to correct its underfunded status. These measures may include, 
but are not limited to, an increase in our contribution rate from that provided in the applicable CBA, a reallocation of the contributions 
already being made by participating employers for various benefits to individuals participating in the MEPP, and/or a reduction 

112

WESTROCK COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

in the benefits to be paid to future and/or current retirees. In addition, the Pension Act requires that a 5% surcharge be levied on 
employer contributions for the first year commencing shortly after the date the employer receives notice that the MEPP is certified 
in the red zone and a 10% surcharge on each succeeding year until a CBA is in place with terms and conditions consistent with 
the RP. On January 1, 2016, the surcharge we pay for PIUMPF increased from 10% to 15%. 

In the normal course of business, we evaluate our potential exposure to MEPPs, including with respect to potential withdrawal 
liabilities. We are considering withdrawing from one or more MEPPs. It is reasonably possible that we may incur significant 
withdrawal liabilities with respect to certain MEPPs in connection with such withdrawal(s). Our withdrawal liability for any 
particular MEPP would depend on the nature and timing of any triggering event and the extent of that MEPP’s funding of vested 
benefits. In addition, we may be obligated to pay a share of a particular MEPPs accumulated funding deficiency as determined 
under the Pension Act. Due to uncertainty regarding future factors that could trigger a withdrawal liability, as well as the absence 
of specific information regarding matters such as a MEPP's current financial situation, we are unable to determine with certainty 
the amount and timing of any future withdrawal liability and/or liability associated with any accumulated funding deficiency, 
changes in future funding obligations or the impact of increased contributions, including those that could be triggered by a mass 
withdrawal of other employers from a MEPP. However, based on available information, including the MEPPs’ latest available 
actuarial valuation reports and annual funding notices, we believe our withdrawal liability would be approximately $140 million 
to $200 million if we were to withdraw from all of the MEPPs in which we participate prior to the end of calendar 2017. The 
foregoing estimate assumes payment of the liabilities over 20 years discounted at 5% and excludes the potential impact of future 
mass withdrawals.

The impact of future withdrawal liabilities, future funding obligations or increased contributions may be material to our results 
of  operations,  cash  flows  and  financial  condition  and  the  trading  price  of  our  Common  Stock. At  September 30,  2017  and 
September 30, 2016, we had withdrawal liabilities recorded of $60.1 million and $49.0 million, respectively. The increase in fiscal 
2017 was primarily due to the MPS Acquisition. In addition to the contributions presented in the table below, for fiscal years 2017, 
2016 and 2015 we accrued $1.9 million, $2.1 million and $0.7 million, respectively, related to withdrawal liabilities.

Approximately 43% of our employees are covered by CBAs or similar agreements, of which approximately 24% of those 
covered by CBAs or similar agreements are covered by CBAs that have expired and another 11% of those covered by CBAs are 
covered by CBAs or similar agreements that expire within one year. Approximately 14% of our CBAs in the U.S. and Canada 
participate in the PIUMPF.

(1)  Contributions represent the amounts contributed to the plan during the fiscal year. 
(2)  Our contributions for fiscal 2016 and 2015 exceeded 5% of total plan contributions. Although the plan data for fiscal 2017 is 

not yet available, we would expect to continue to exceed 5% of total plan contributions.

(3)  Two additional MEPPs in which we participate have been certified in the red zone for critical and declining.

Defined Contribution Plans

We have 401(k) and other defined contribution plans that cover certain of our U.S., Canadian and other non-U.S. salaried 
union and nonunion hourly employees, generally subject to an initial waiting period. The 401(k) and other defined contribution 
plans permit participants to make contributions by salary reduction pursuant to Section 401(k) of the Code or the taxing authority 
in the jurisdiction in which they operate. Due primarily to acquisitions, CBAs and other non-U.S. defined contribution programs, 
we have plans with varied terms. At September 30, 2017, our contributions may be up to 7.5% for U.S. salaried and non-union

hourly employees, consisting of a match of up to 5% and an automatic employer contribution of 2.5%. Certain other employees 
who receive accruals under a defined benefit pension plan, certain employees covered by CBAs and non-U.S. defined contribution 
programs receive generally up to a 3.0% to 4.0% contribution to their 401(k) plan or defined contribution plan. During fiscal 2017, 
2016 and 2015, we recorded expense of $104.1 million, $86.5 million and $36.6 million, respectively, related to the 401(k) plans 
and other defined contribution plans, including the automatic employer contribution. The increased expense in fiscal 2016 related 
to plan changes following the Combination.

Supplemental Retirement Plans

We have Supplemental Plans that are nonqualified deferred compensation plans. We intend to provide participants with an 
opportunity to supplement their retirement income through deferral of current compensation. Amounts deferred and payable under 
the Supplemental Plans are our unsecured obligations and rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness 
outstanding. Participants’ accounts are credited with investment gains and losses under the Supplemental Plans in accordance with 
the participant’s investment election or elections (or default election or elections) as in effect from time to time. At September 30, 
2017, the Supplemental Plans had assets totaling $168.9 million that are recorded at market value, and liabilities of $176.2 million. 
The investment alternatives available under the Supplemental Plans are generally similar to investment alternatives available under 
401(k) plans. The amount of expense we recorded for the current fiscal year and the preceding two fiscal years was not significant.

Note 16.  Stockholders’ Equity

Capitalization

Our capital stock consists solely of Common Stock. Holders of our Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share. Our 
amended and restated certificate of incorporation also authorizes preferred stock, of which no shares have been issued. The terms 
and provisions of such shares will be determined by our board of directors upon any issuance of such shares in accordance with 
our certificate of incorporation.

Stock Repurchase Plan

In July 2015, our board of directors authorized a repurchase program of up to 40.0 million shares of our Common Stock, 
representing approximately 15% of our outstanding Common Stock as of July 1, 2015. The shares of our Common Stock may be 
repurchased over an indefinite period of time at the discretion of management. In fiscal 2017, we repurchased approximately 1.8 
million shares of our Common Stock for an aggregate cost of $93.0 million. In fiscal 2016, we repurchased approximately 8.1 
million shares of our Common Stock for an aggregate cost of $335.3 million. Subsequent to the authorization, in the fourth quarter 
of fiscal 2015, we repurchased approximately 5.4 million shares of our Common Stock for an aggregate cost of $328.0 million. 
Separately, as part of the Combination, RockTenn repurchased 10.5 million shares of RockTenn Common Stock for an aggregate 
cost of $667.8 million. Prior to the closing of the Combination and pursuant to the then existing RockTenn repurchase plan, in the 
first quarter of fiscal 2015, RockTenn repurchased 0.2 million shares of RockTenn Common Stock for an aggregate cost of $8.7 
million. As of September 30, 2017, we had remaining authorization under the repurchase program authorized in July 2015 to 
purchase approximately 24.7 million shares of our Common Stock.

Note 17.  Share-Based Compensation

Share-based Compensation Plans

At our Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on February 2, 2016, our stockholders approved the 2016 Incentive Stock Plan 
and the ESPP Plan. The 2016 Incentive Stock Plan allows for the granting of options, restricted stock, SARs and restricted stock 
units to certain key employees and directors for the issuance of up to 9.6 million shares of Common Stock. Adjusted for the 
Separation as discussed below, at September 30, 2017, approximately 6.9 million shares remained available for future grants. If 
all currently outstanding restricted stock awards granted with a performance condition recorded at target achieve the maximum 
award, shares available for future grant would be reduced by approximately 2.0 million additional shares. The ESPP provides for 
the purchase of shares by all of our eligible employees at a 15% discount and allowed for the purchase of a total of up to 2.5 million
shares of Common Stock. As of September 30, 2017, adjusted for the Separation, approximately 2.6 million shares of Common 
Stock remained available for purchase under the ESPP.

WESTROCK COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In connection with the Combination, WestRock assumed all RockTenn and MWV equity incentive plans. We issue nonqualified 
stock options and restricted stock to certain key employees and our directors pursuant to our RockTenn 2004 Incentive Stock Plan, 
as amended, and our MWV 2005 Performance Incentive Plan, as amended. 

The RockTenn 2004 Incentive Stock Plan allows for the granting of options, restricted stock, SARs and restricted stock units 
to certain key employees and directors for the issuance of approximately 15.8 million shares of Common Stock. At the time of 
the Combination, all outstanding RockTenn awards were converted to WestRock awards with no conversion factor. Adjusted for 
the Separation as discussed below, at September 30, 2017, approximately 3.1 million shares remained available for the future grant 
of awards. If all currently outstanding restricted stock awards subject to performance criteria recorded at target achieve the maximum 
award, shares available for future grant would be reduced by approximately 0.4 million additional shares. However, we have 
determined that we will not make any new grants of awards pursuant to the RockTenn 2004 Incentive Stock Plan.

In connection with the Combination, we assumed the MWV 2005 Performance Incentive Plan. The MWV shares available 
for issuance, stock options, SARs and unvested restricted stock units outstanding at the time of the Combination under the MWV 
2005 Performance Incentive Plan were converted into WestRock options, SARs and restricted stock units, as applicable, with 
respect to shares of our Common Stock using the conversion factor as described in the Business Combination Agreement. The 
number of shares available under this plan upon conversion was approximately 12.8 million shares. Adjusted for the Separation 
as discussed below, at September 30, 2017, approximately 8.9 million shares remained available for future grants. If all currently 
outstanding restricted stock awards granted with a performance condition recorded at target achieve the maximum award, shares 
available for future grant would be reduced by approximately 0.1 million additional shares. However, we have determined that 
we will not make any new grants of awards pursuant to the MWV 2005 Performance Incentive Plan.

In connection with the Smurfit-Stone Acquisition, we assumed the Smurfit-Stone equity incentive plan, which was renamed 
the Rock-Tenn Company (SSCC) Equity Incentive Plan. The shares available for issuance, stock options and unvested restricted 
stock units outstanding at the time of the Smurfit-Stone Acquisition, under the Smurfit-Stone plan were converted into shares of 
RockTenn Common Stock, options and restricted stock units, as applicable, using the conversion factor as described in the merger 
agreement. The number of shares available under this plan upon conversion was approximately 7.9 million shares. Adjusted for 
the Separation as discussed below, at September 30, 2017, approximately 5.9 million shares remained available for future grants 
exclusively to legacy Smurfit-Stone employees who have continued employment with WestRock; however, we have determined 
that we will not make any new grants of awards pursuant to the Rock-Tenn Company (SSCC) Equity Incentive Plan. 

As part of the Separation, equity-based incentive awards were generally adjusted to maintain the intrinsic value of awards 
immediately prior to the Separation. The number of unvested restricted stock awards and unexercised stock options and SARs at 
the time of the Separation were increased by an exchange factor of approximately 1.12. In addition, the exercise price of unexercised 
stock options and SARs at the time of the Separation was converted to decrease the exercise price by an exchange factor of 
approximately 1.12. 

Our results of operations for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015 include share-based compensation 
expense of $60.9 million, $75.7 million and $49.2 million, respectively, including $2.9 million included in the gain on sale of 
HH&B. Share-based compensation expense in fiscal 2017 was reduced by $5.4 million for the rescission of shares granted to our 
CEO that were inadvertently granted in excess of plan limits in fiscal 2014 and 2015. The total income tax benefit in the results 
of operations in connection with share-based compensation was $22.5 million, $29.2 million and $19.0 million, for the fiscal years 
ended September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

ASC 718 requires that the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost are reported as a financing 
cash flow. Excess tax benefits of approximately $6.7 million, $0.3 million and $23.0 million were included in cash used for 
financing activities in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Cash received from share-based payment arrangements for the 
fiscal years ended September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $59.2 million, $33.9 million and $27.2 million, respectively.

Equity Awards Issued in Connection with the MPS Acquisition

In connection with the MPS Acquisition, we replaced certain outstanding awards of restricted stock units granted under the 
MPS long-term incentive plan with WestRock restricted stock units. No additional shares will be granted under the MPS plan. 
The MPS equity awards were replaced with identical terms utilizing an approximately 0.33 conversion factor as described in the 
merger agreement. As part of the MPS Acquisition, we granted 119,373 awards of restricted stock units, which contain service 
conditions and were valued at $54.24 per share. The acquisition consideration included approximately $1.9 million related to 

115

WESTROCK COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

outstanding MPS equity awards related to service prior to the effective date of the merger – the balance related to service after the 
effective date will be expensed over the remaining service period of the awards. 

Equity Awards Issued in Connection with the Combination

Included in the fiscal 2015 merger consideration was approximately $210.9 million related to outstanding MWV equity awards 
that were replaced with WestRock equity awards with identical terms for pre-Combination service utilizing a 0.78 conversion 
factor. The amount related to post-Combination service will be expensed over the remaining service period of the awards. The 
primary components of the employee awards are discussed below.

Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights

Stock options granted under our plans generally have an exercise price equal to the closing market price on the date of the 
grant, generally vest in three years, in either one tranche or in approximately one-third increments, and have 10-year contractual 
terms. However, a portion of our grants are subject to earlier expense recognition due to retirement eligibility rules. Presently, 
other than circumstances such as death, disability and retirement, grants will include a provision requiring both a change of control 
and termination of employment to accelerate vesting.

At the date of grant, we estimate the fair value of stock options granted using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. We use 
historical data to estimate option exercises and employee terminations in determining the expected term in years for stock options. 
Expected volatility is calculated based on the historical volatility of our stock, or a combination of the historical volatility of both 
RockTenn and MWV grants. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury securities in effect at the date of the grant of the 
stock options. The dividend yield is estimated based on our historic annual dividend payments and current expectations for the 
future.

We applied the following weighted average assumptions to estimate the fair value of stock option grants made in the following 

periods, including the grants issued in connection with the Combination in fiscal 2015:

We did not grant any stock options in fiscal 2017. The expected term and the expected volatility in fiscal 2015 are lower than 
fiscal 2016 primarily as a result of the characteristics of the shares issued in connection with the Combination and our expectations 
for expected term and expected volatility following the Combination.

The weighted average grant date fair value for options granted during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015
was  $8.06  and  $28.78  per  share,  respectively.  The  aggregate  intrinsic  value  of  options  exercised  during  the  years  ended 
September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $54.3 million, $14.5 million and $25.1 million, respectively.

As of September 30, 2017, there was $2.4 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock options; 
that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average remaining vesting period of 1.1 years. We amortize these costs on 
a straight-line basis over the explicit service period. 

As part of the Combination, we issued SARs to replace outstanding MWV SARs. The SARs were valued using the Black-
Scholes option pricing model. We measure compensation expense related to the SAR awards at the end of each period. We do not 
expect to issue additional SARs.

Restricted Stock 

Restricted stock is typically granted annually to non-employee directors and certain of our employees. Our non-employee 
director awards generally vest over a period of up to one year and are treated as issued and carry dividend and voting rights until 
they vest. The vesting provisions for our employee awards may vary from grant to grant; however, vesting generally is contingent 
upon meeting various service and/or performance or market goals including, but not limited to, achievement of various financial 
targets including Cash Flow Per Share, Cash Flow to Equity Ratio and relative Total Shareholder Return (each as defined in the 
award documents). Subject to the level of performance attained, the target award for some of the grants may increase up to 200%
of target or decrease to zero depending upon the terms of the individual grant. The employee grants generally vest in three years. 
Presently, other than circumstances such as death, disability and retirement, the grants generally include a provision requiring both 
a change of control and termination of employment to accelerate vesting. For certain employee grants, the grantee is entitled to 
receive dividend equivalent units, but will generally forfeit the restricted award and the dividend equivalents if the employee 
separates from us during the vesting period or if the predetermined goals are not accomplished.

(1)  Target awards granted with a performance condition, net of subsequent forfeitures, may be increased up to 200% of the target 
or decreased to zero, subject to the level of performance attained. The awards are reflected in the table at the target award 
amount of 100%. Based on current facts and assumptions we are forecasting the performance of the grants to be attained at 
levels that would result in the issuance of approximately 1.4 million additional shares. However, it is possible that the 
performance attained may vary.

There was approximately $83.5 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to all unvested restricted shares as of 

September 30, 2017 that will be recognized over a weighted average remaining vesting period of 1.6 years.

The following table represents a summary of restricted stock shares granted in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 with terms defined 
in the applicable grant letters. The shares are not deemed to be issued and carry voting rights until the relevant conditions defined

(1)  Non-employee director grants generally vest over a period of up to one year and are deemed issued on the grant date and have 

voting and dividend rights. 

(2)  Shares granted in the table above include shares subsequently issued for the level of performance attained in excess of target.  
Shares issued in fiscal 2017 for the fiscal 2014 Cash Flow to Equity Ratio were at 176.6% of target. Shares issued in fiscal 
2016 for the fiscal 2013 Cash Flow to Equity Ratio were at 200% of target. Shares issued in fiscal 2015 for the fiscal 2012 
Cash Flow to Equity Ratio were at 200% of target. Shares issued in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 also include shares accelerated 
for terminated employees primarily as a result of the Combination, which were achieved at between 146.5% and 200% of 
target.

(3)  These employee grants vest over approximately three years and have adjustable ranges from 0-200% of target subject to the 
level of performance attained in the respective award agreement. The employee grants with a relative Total Shareholder Return 
condition were valued using a Monte Carlo simulation, the terms of which are outlined below. 

(4)  Shares granted in fiscal 2015 were reduced by 50,326 shares at target related to the rescission of shares granted to our CEO 

that were inadvertently granted in excess of plan limits.

(5)  These shares vest over approximately three to four years.

(6)  As a result of the Combination, certain target awards granted to employees in fiscal 2015 were prorated with the employee 
receiving approximately 16.6% of the target award in accordance with the terms in the award document prior to the application 
of  the  performance  adjustment.  The  performance  period  applicable  to  each  award  ended  upon  consummation  of  the 
Combination, and the performance goals were determined in accordance with the applicable grant letter to be attained at 
146.5% of target.

(7)  The performance period applicable to each award ended upon consummation of the Combination, and the performance goals 

were determined in accordance with the applicable grant letter to be attained at between 100% and 168% of target.

(8)  These shares vest over approximately one to three years.

The employee grants with a relative Total Shareholder Return market condition were valued using a Monte Carlo simulation 
at $64.41 per share. The significant assumptions used in valuing these grants included: an expected term of 2.9 years, an expected 
volatility of 30.6% and a risk-free interest rate of 1.4%. We amortize these costs on a straight-line basis over the explicit service 
period. 

Expense is recognized on restricted stock grants on a straight-line basis over the explicit service period or for performance 
based grants over the explicit service period when we estimate that it is probable the performance conditions will be satisfied. 
Expense recognized on grants with a performance condition that affects how many shares are ultimately awarded is based on the 
number of shares expected to be awarded. 

The following table represents a summary of restricted stock vested in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 (in millions, except shares):

The shares vested in 2017 reflect the vesting of the fiscal 2014 grant, with a cash flow to equity ratio performance condition 
that vested at 176.6% of target, certain shares assumed upon the Combination with a performance and/or service condition, as 
well as other awards accelerated in connection with the Combination for certain former employees. The shares vested in 2016 
reflect the vesting of the fiscal 2013 grant, with a cash flow to equity ratio performance condition that vested at maximum, certain 
shares  assumed  upon  the  Combination  with  a  performance  and/or  service  condition,  as  well  as  other  awards  accelerated  in 
connection with the Combination for certain former employees. The shares vested in fiscal 2015 primarily reflect the vesting of 
the fiscal 2012 grant, with a cash flow to equity ratio performance condition that vested at maximum, as well as other awards 
accelerated in connection with the Combination for certain former employees.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

Under the ESPP, shares of Common Stock are reserved for purchase by our qualifying employees. The ESPP allowed for the 
purchase of a total of approximately 2.5 million shares of Common Stock. During fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, including shares 
purchased under the then existing RockTenn Employee Stock Purchase Plan, employees purchased approximately 0.2 million, 
0.1 million and 0.1 million shares, respectively, under the ESPP. We recognized $1.3 million, $0.4 million and $0.5 million of 
expense for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, related to the 15% discount on the purchase price allowed to employees. As 
of September 30, 2017, adjusted for the Separation, approximately 2.6 million shares of Common Stock remained available for 
purchase under the ESPP.

Note 18.  Related Party Transactions

We sell products to affiliated companies. Net sales to the affiliated companies for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2017,

Environmental and Other Matters

Environmental compliance requirements are a significant factor affecting our business. We employ manufacturing processes 
that result in various discharges, emissions and wastes. These processes are subject to numerous federal, state, local and international 
environmental laws and regulations, as well as the requirements of environmental permits and similar authorizations issued by 
various governmental authorities.

On January 31, 2013, the EPA published Boiler MACT. Boiler MACT required compliance by January 31, 2016 or by January 
31, 2017 for those mills for which we obtained a prior compliance extension. All work required for our boilers to comply with the 
rule has been completed. On July 29, 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued a ruling on the 
consolidated cases challenging Boiler MACT. The court vacated key portions of the rule, including emission limits for certain 
subcategories of solid fuel boilers, and remanded other issues to the EPA for further rulemaking. At this time, we cannot predict 
with certainty how this decision will impact our existing Boiler MACT strategies or whether we will incur additional costs to 
comply with any revised Boiler MACT standards.

In addition to Boiler MACT, we are subject to a number of other federal, state, local and international environmental rules 
that may impact our business, including the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, fine 
particulate matter and ozone for facilities in the U.S. 

We are involved in various administrative proceedings relating to environmental matters that arise in the normal course of 
business, and may be involved in future matters. Although the ultimate outcome of such matters cannot be predicted with certainty 
and we cannot at this time estimate any reasonably possible losses based on available information, we do not believe that the 
currently expected outcome of any environmental proceedings and claims that are pending or threatened against us will have a 
material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. 

CERCLA and Other Remediation Costs

We face potential liability under federal, state, local and international laws as a result of releases, or threatened releases, of 
hazardous substances into the environment from various sites owned and operated by third parties at which Company-generated 
wastes have allegedly been deposited. Generators of hazardous substances sent to off-site disposal locations at which environmental 
problems exist, as well as the owners of those sites and certain other classes of persons, are liable for response costs for the 
investigation and remediation of such sites under CERCLA and analogous laws. While joint and several liability is authorized 
under CERCLA, liability is typically shared with other PRPs, and costs are commonly allocated according to relative amounts of 
waste deposited and other factors.

In addition, certain of our current or former locations are being investigated or remediated under various environmental laws, 
including CERCLA, and regulations. Based on information known to us and assumptions, we do not believe that the costs of these 
projects will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. However, the discovery 
of contamination or the imposition of additional obligations at these or other sites in the future could result in additional costs.

On January 26, 2009, Smurfit-Stone and certain of its subsidiaries filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the 
U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Smurfit-Stone’s Canadian subsidiaries also filed to reorganize in Canada. We believe that matters relating 
to previously identified third party PRP sites and certain facilities formerly owned or operated by Smurfit-Stone have been or will 
be satisfied claims in the Smurfit-Stone bankruptcy proceedings. However, we may face additional liability for cleanup activity 
at sites that are not subject to the bankruptcy discharge, but are not currently identified. Some of these liabilities may be satisfied 
from existing bankruptcy reserves. 

We believe that we can assert claims for indemnification pursuant to existing rights we have under purchase and other 
agreements in connection with certain of our existing remediation sites. In addition, we believe that we have insurance coverage, 
subject to applicable deductibles/retentions, policy limits and other conditions, for certain environmental matters. However, there 
can be no assurance that we will be successful with respect to any claim regarding these insurance or indemnification rights, or 
that, if we are successful, any amounts paid pursuant to the insurance or indemnification rights will be sufficient to cover all our 
costs and expenses. We also cannot predict with certainty whether we will be required to perform remediation projects at other 
locations, and it is possible that our remediation requirements and costs could increase materially in the future and exceed current 
reserves. In addition, we cannot currently assess with certainty the impact that future changes in cleanup standards or federal, state 

120

WESTROCK COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

or other environmental laws, regulations or enforcement practices will have on our results of operations, financial condition or 
cash flows.

As of September 30, 2017, we had $15.0 million reserved for environmental liabilities on an undiscounted basis, of which 
$9.6 million is included in other long-term liabilities and $5.4 million in other current liabilities, including amounts accrued in 
connection with environmental obligations relating to the manufacturing facilities that we have closed. We believe the liability 
for these matters was adequately reserved at September 30, 2017.

Climate Change

Certain jurisdictions in which we have manufacturing facilities or other investments have taken actions to address climate 
change. The EPA has issued the Clean Air Act permitting regulations applicable to certain facilities that emit GHG. The EPA also 
has promulgated a rule requiring certain industrial facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of carbon dioxide equivalent per 
year  to  file  an  annual  report  of  their  emissions. While  we  have  facilities  subject  to  existing  GHG  permitting  and  reporting 
requirements, the impact of these requirements has not been material to date.

Additionally, the EPA has been working on a set of interrelated rulemakings aimed at cutting carbon emissions from power 
plants. On August 3, 2015, the EPA issued the Clean Power Plan. On the same day, the EPA issued a second rule setting standards 
of performance for new, modified and reconstructed electric utility generating units. While these rules do not apply directly to the 
power generation facilities at our mills, they have the potential to increase the cost of purchased electricity for our manufacturing 
operations and change the treatment of certain types of biomass that are currently considered carbon neutral. On February 9, 2016, 
the U.S. Supreme Court issued a stay halting implementation of the Clean Power Plan until the pending legal challenges to the 
rule are resolved. As directed by Executive Order, on April 4, 2017, the EPA issued a proposed rule announcing its intention to 
review the Clean Power Plan, and, if appropriate, initiate proceedings to suspend, revise or rescind it. A number of states subject 
to the Clean Power Plan have stopped working on their implementation strategies in response to the litigation and Executive Order; 
however, certain states where we operate manufacturing facilities have indicated their intention to continue their carbon reduction 
efforts. On October 16, 2017, the EPA issued a proposal rule that would repeal the Clean Power Plan. Due to ongoing litigation 
and other uncertainties regarding the Clean Power Plan, its impact on us cannot be quantified with certainty at this time. 

In addition to national efforts to regulate climate change, some U.S. states in which we have manufacturing operations are 
also taking measures to reduce GHG emissions, such as requiring GHG emissions reporting or developing regional cap-and trade 
programs. California has enacted a cap-and-trade program that took effect in 2012, and includes enforceable compliance obligations 
that  began  on  January  1,  2013.  In  July  2017,  California  extended  the  cap-and-trade  program  to  2030. We  do  not  have  any 
manufacturing facilities that are subject to the cap-and-trade requirements in California; however, we are continuing to monitor 
the implementation of this program as well as proposed mandatory GHG reduction efforts in other states. Also, the Washington 
Department of Ecology has issued a final rule, known as the Clean Air Rule, which limits GHGs from facilities that have average 
annual carbon dioxide equivalent emissions equal to or exceeding 100,000 metric tons/year and proposes to begin GHG emissions 
reduction requirements for some regulated entities in 2017. Energy intensive and trade exposed facilities and transportation fuel 
importers, including our Tacoma, WA mill, are subject to regulation under this program. In September 2016, various groups filed 
lawsuits against the Washington Department of Ecology challenging the Clean Air Rule. We are carefully monitoring this litigation 
to assess its potential impact on our Tacoma operations. On May 16, 2017, the Governor of Virginia issued Executive Directive 
11, directing the Secretary of Natural Resources to convene a work group to study and recommend methods to reduce carbon 
dioxide emissions from electric power facilities and grow the clean energy economy within existing state authority. We have been 
selected by the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality to participate in this work group.

The Paris Agreement established a framework for reducing global GHG emissions. By signing the Paris Agreement, the U.S. 
made a non-binding commitment to reduce economy-wide GHG emissions by 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by 2025. Other 
countries in which we conduct business, including China, European Union member states and India, have set similar GHG reduction 
targets. The Paris Agreement became effective on November 4, 2016. Although a party to the agreement may not provide the 
required one-year notice of withdrawal until three years after the effective date, in June 2017, President Trump announced that 
the U.S. intended to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. The governors of New York, California and Washington subsequently 
announced their intent to form a “climate alliance” to coordinate a state response to climate change. At this time, it is not possible 
to determine how the Paris Agreement, or any potential U.S. commitments in lieu of those under the agreement, may impact U.S. 
industrial facilities, including our domestic operations. 

121

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Several of our international facilities are located in countries that have already adopted GHG emissions trading schemes. For 
example, Quebec has become a member of the Western Climate Initiative, which is a collaboration among California and certain 
Canadian provinces that have joined together to create a cap-and-trade program to reduce GHG emissions. In 2009, Quebec adopted 
a target of reducing GHG emissions by 20% below 1990 levels by 2020 and 37.5% from 1990 levels by 2030. In 2011, Quebec 
issued a final regulation establishing a regional cap-and-trade program that required reductions in GHG emissions from covered 
emitters as of January 1, 2013. Our mill in Quebec is subject to these cap-and-trade requirements, although the direct impact of 
this regulation has not been material to date. Compliance with this program and other similar programs may require future 
expenditures to meet required GHG emission reduction requirements in future years. 

The regulation of climate change continues to develop in the areas of the world where we conduct business. We have systems 
in place for tracking the GHG emissions from our energy-intensive facilities, and we carefully monitor developments in climate 
change laws, regulations and policies to assess the potential impact of such developments on our results of operations, financial 
condition, cash flows and disclosure obligations.

Litigation

The complaint in the Antitrust Litigation seeks treble damages and costs, including attorney’s fees. In March 2015, the court 
granted the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification. On January 9, 2017, the defendants filed individual and joint Motions for 
Summary Judgment in the District Court. On August 3, 2017, the District Court granted our Motion for Summary Judgment with 
respect to all claims against us.  The plaintiffs have filed a notice of appeal.

As with numerous other large industrial companies, we have been named a defendant in asbestos-related personal injury 
litigation. Typically, these suits also name many other corporate defendants. To date, the costs resulting from the litigation, including 
settlement costs, have not been significant. As of September 30, 2017, there were approximately 725 lawsuits. We believe that we 
have substantial insurance coverage, subject to applicable deductibles and policy limits, with respect to asbestos claims. We have 
valid defenses to these asbestos-related personal injury claims and intend to continue to defend them vigorously. Should the volume 
of litigation grow substantially, it is possible that we could incur significant costs resolving these cases. We do not expect the 
resolution of pending litigation and proceedings to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or 
liquidity. In any given period or periods, however, it is possible such proceedings or matters could have a material adverse effect 
on our results of operations. 

We are a defendant in a number of other lawsuits and claims arising out of the conduct of our business. While the ultimate 
results of such suits or other proceedings against us cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the resolution of these other 
matters will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, consolidated financial condition or cash flows.

Guarantees

We make certain guarantees in the course of conducting our operations, for compliance with certain laws and regulations, or 
in connection with certain business dispositions. The guarantees include items such as funding of net losses in proportion to our 
ownership share of certain joint ventures, debt guarantees related to certain unconsolidated entities acquired in acquisitions, 
indemnifications of lessors in certain facilities and equipment operating leases for items such as additional taxes being assessed 
due to a change in tax law, and, certain other agreements. We estimate the exposure for these matters could be approximately $50 
million. As of September 30, 2017, we have recorded $11.9 million for the estimated fair value of these guarantees. We are unable 
to estimate our maximum exposure under operating leases because it is dependent on potential changes in the tax law, however, 
we believe our exposure related to guarantees would not have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition 
or cash flows.

Note 20. 

 Special Purpose Entities 

Pursuant to a sale of certain large-tract forestlands in 2007, a special purpose entity MWV Timber Notes Holding, LLC 
received, and WestRock assumed upon the Combination, an installment note receivable in the amount of $398.0 million. The 
Timber Note does not require any principal payments until its maturity in October 2027 and bears interest at a rate approximating 
LIBOR. In addition, the Timber Note is supported by a bank-issued irrevocable letter of credit obtained by the buyer of the 
forestlands. The Timber Note is not subject to prepayment in whole or in part prior to maturity. The bank’s credit rating as of 
November 2017 was investment grade.

122

WESTROCK COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Using the Timber Note as collateral, MWV TN received $338.3 million in proceeds under a secured financing agreement with 
a bank. Under the terms of the agreement, the liability from this transaction is non-recourse to the Company and is payable from 
the Timber Note proceeds upon its maturity in October 2027. As a result, the Timber Note is not available to satisfy any obligations 
of WestRock. MWV TN can elect to prepay at any time the liability in whole or in part, however, given that the Timber Note is 
not prepayable, MWV TN expects to only repay the liability at maturity from the Timber Note proceeds.

The Timber Note and the secured financing liability were fair valued on the opening balance sheet in connection with the 
Combination. As of September 30, 2017, the Timber Note was $363.0 million and is included within restricted assets held by 
special purpose entities on the consolidated balance sheet and the secured financing liability was $321.7 million and is included 
within non-recourse liabilities held by special purpose entities on the consolidated balance sheet.

Pursuant to the sale of MWV’s remaining U.S. forestlands, which occurred on December 6, 2013, another special purpose 
entity MWV Timber Notes Holding Company II, LLC received, and WestRock assumed upon the Combination, an installment 
note receivable in the amount of $860.0 million. The Installment Note does not require any principal payments until its maturity 
in December 2023 and bears interest at a fixed rate of 5.207%. However, at any time during a 180-day period following receipt 
by the borrower of notice from us that we intend to withhold our consent to any amendment or waiver of this Installment Note 
that was requested by the borrower and approved by any eligible assignees, the borrower may prepay the Installment Note in whole 
but not in part for cash at 100% of the principal, plus accrued but unpaid interest, breakage, or other similar amount if any. As of 
September 30, 2017, no event had occurred that would allow for the prepayment of the Installment Note. We monitor the credit 
quality of the borrower and receive quarterly compliance certificates. The borrower’s credit rating as of November 2017 was 
investment grade.

Using the Installment Note as collateral, MWV TN II received $774.0 million in proceeds under a secured financing agreement 
with a bank. Under the terms of the agreement, the liability from this transaction is non-recourse to WestRock and is payable from 
the Installment Note proceeds upon its maturity in December 2023. As a result, the Installment Note is not available to satisfy any 
obligations of WestRock. MWV TN II can elect to prepay, at any time, the liability in whole or in part, with sufficient notice, but 
would avail itself of this provision only in the event the Installment Note was prepaid in whole or in part. The secured financing 
agreement however requires a mandatory repayment, up to the amount of cash received, if the Installment Note is prepaid in whole 
or in part.

The Installment Note and the secured financing liability were fair valued on the opening balance sheet in connection with the 
Combination. As of September 30, 2017, the Installment Note was $924.4 million and is included within restricted assets held by 
special purpose entities on the consolidated balance sheet and the secured financing liability was $840.2 million and is included 
within non-recourse liabilities held by special purpose entities on the consolidated balance sheet.

The increase in the Corrugated Packaging segment’s investment in unconsolidated entities in fiscal 2016 was primarily related 
to the Grupo Gondi investment. The Corporate investment in unconsolidated entities in fiscal 2016 primarily represented an entity 
that had losses that were guaranteed equally by the partners; this subsidiary has since been sold. The investment in Grupo Gondi 
that is included in the Corrugated Packaging segment’s investment in unconsolidated entities in fiscal 2017 and 2016 exceeds our 
proportionate  share  of  the  underlying  equity  in  net  assets  by  approximately  $76.2  million  and  $65.3  million,  respectively. 
Approximately $59.2 million and $56.2 million remains amortizable to expense in equity in income of unconsolidated entities 
over the estimated life of the underlying assets ranging from 10 to 15 years beginning with our investment in fiscal 2016. In fiscal

We computed the interim earnings per common and common equivalent share amounts as if each quarter was a discrete period.  
As a result, the sum of the basic and diluted earnings per share by quarter will not necessarily total the annual basic and diluted 
earnings per share.

Consolidated net income in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 financial results by quarter (unaudited) table was increased due to 
a $23.8 million tax benefit related to the reduction of a state deferred tax liability as a result of an internal U.S. legal entity 
restructuring that will simplify future operating activities within the U.S. Basic and diluted earnings per share attributable to 
common stockholders were each increased by approximately $0.09 per share.

WESTROCK COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Consolidated net income in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 financial results by quarter (unaudited) table was decreased due 
to a non-cash charge of $28.7 million recorded on the line item “Pension lump sum settlement” on our Consolidated Statements 
of Operations related to our year to date lump sum payments to certain beneficiaries of the Plan, together with several one-time 
severance benefit payments out of the Plan, triggered pension settlement accounting. For additional information see “Note 15. 
Retirement  Plans”. Additionally,  consolidated  net  income  in  the  second  quarter  of  fiscal  2017  financial  results  by  quarter 
(unaudited) table was decreased due to a non-cash charge of $42.7 million, or $36.3 million net of $6.4 million of noncontrolling 
interest, recorded on the line item “Land and development impairment” on our Consolidated Statements of Operations due to the 
accelerated monetization strategy in our Land and Development segment. The impairment was recorded to write-down the carrying 
value on projects where the projected sales proceeds were less than the carrying value. Basic and diluted earnings per share 
attributable to common stockholders were each decreased by approximately $0.16 per share for these items. 

Consolidated net income in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 financial results by quarter (unaudited) table was increased due 
to a pre-tax gain on sale of HH&B of $190.6 million. Basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations and basic 
and diluted earnings per share attributable to common stockholders were each increased by approximately $0.76 and $0.75 per 
share, respectively. See “Note 8. Assets Held For Sale” for additional information.

 
(Loss) income from discontinued operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 financial results by quarter (unaudited) table 
includes a pre-tax non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $478.3 million as a result of our evaluation of whether events or 
changes in circumstances had occurred that would indicate whether it was more likely than not that the goodwill of our then-
owned Specialty Chemicals reporting unit was impaired. No tax benefit was recorded for the goodwill impairment. See “Note 7. 
Discontinued Operations” for additional information. Basic and diluted earnings per share attributable to common stockholders 
were decreased by approximately $1.86 and $1.83 per share, respectively.

(Loss) income from discontinued operations in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 financial results by quarter (unaudited) table 
includes a $101.1 million pre-tax non-cash impairment of our Specialty Chemicals customer relationships intangible that was 
evaluated at the time of the Separation. Basic and diluted earnings per share attributable to common stockholders were each 
decreased by approximately $0.27 per share. See “Note 7. Discontinued Operations” for additional information.

Income from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 financial results by quarter (unaudited) table was 
decreased due to a non-cash charge of $370.7 million recorded on the line item “Pension risk transfer expense” on our Consolidated 
Statements of Operations as we settled $2.5 billion in pension obligations of the Plan. Basic and diluted earnings per share from 
continuing operations and basic and diluted earnings per share attributable to common stockholders were each decreased by 
approximately $0.91 per share. See “Note 15. Retirement Plans” for additional information. 

Note 23.  Subsequent Events (Unaudited) 

Grupo Gondi Investment

On October 20, 2017, we increased our ownership interest in the Grupo Gondi joint venture to approximately 32.3% through 
a $108 million capital contribution, which followed a redemption of a minority partner in April 2017. The capital contribution will 
be used to support the joint venture’s capital expansion plans, including related to a greenfield containerboard mill and several 
converting plants. Each partner continues to hold future put and call rights with respect to its respective ownership interest in the 
joint venture.

Commercial Paper Program

On October 31, 2017, we established an unsecured commercial paper program, pursuant to which we may issue short-term, 
unsecured commercial paper notes in an aggregate principal amount at any time not to exceed $1.0 billion. Amounts available 
under the program may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed from time to time. The net proceeds of issuances of the notes under 
the program are expected to be used for general corporate purposes.

Capital Investment in Florence, South Carolina Mill

On November 16, 2017, we announced our intention to invest approximately $410 million over two years in connection with 
installing a 330” kraft linerboard machine and related infrastructure that will replace three older, narrow-width paper machines at 

129

WESTROCK COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

our kraft linerboard mill located in Florence, South Carolina. In addition, we expect to invest approximately $60 million over the 
next five years to support the new machine and other projects. We expect the new machine to become operational in the first half 
of calendar 2020 and to produce 710,000 tons of kraft linerboard annually.

New Revolving Credit Facility

On October 31, 2017, we entered into a credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative 
agent, providing for a 364-day senior unsecured revolving credit facility in an aggregate committed principal amount of $450.0 
million. The proceeds of the credit facility may be used for working capital and for other general corporate purposes. The credit 
facility is unsecured and is guaranteed by WestRock RKT Company and WestRock MWV, LLC. At our option, loans issued under 
the credit facility will bear interest at either LIBOR or an alternate base rate, in each case plus an applicable interest rate margin. 

Other Activity

On October 31, 2017, we borrowed $485.0 million under our Receivables Facility and prepaid $485.0 million outstanding 
under our term loan. There are no further amortization payments due under the term loan facility until its maturity. See “Note 11. 
Debt” for additional information about these facilities.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of
WestRock Company

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of WestRock Company as of September 30, 2017 and 2016, and 
the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), equity and cash flows for each of the three years 
in the period ended September 30, 2017. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our 
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). 
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements 
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures 
in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by 
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable 
basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position 
of WestRock Company at September 30, 2017 and 2016, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each 
of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2017, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We  also  have  audited,  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United 
States), WestRock Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2017, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 
framework) and our report dated November 17, 2017, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of 
WestRock Company

We have audited WestRock Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2017, based on criteria 
established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway 
Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). WestRock Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective 
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting 
included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is 
to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). 
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control 
over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control 
over  financial  reporting,  assessing  the  risk  that  a  material  weakness  exists,  testing  and  evaluating  the  design  and  operating 
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in 
the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability 
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain 
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets 
of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial 
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are 
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable 
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that 
could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because  of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements. Also, 
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because 
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
As indicated in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management’s 
assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls 
of the Company’s operations related to the MPS Acquisition, the U.S. Corrugated Acquisition, the Island Container Acquisition, 
the  Hannapak Acquisition  and  the  Star  Pizza Acquisition,  which  are  included  in  the  fiscal  year  2017  consolidated  financial 
statements of WestRock Company and constituted $3.6 billion of total assets as of September 30, 2017 and $0.6 billion of revenues 
for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of WestRock also did not include an evaluation of 
the internal control over financial reporting of the Company’s operations related to the MPS Acquisition, the U.S. Corrugated

consolidated balance sheets of WestRock Company as of September 30, 2017 and 2016, and the related consolidated statements 
of operations, comprehensive income (loss), equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30,

MANAGEMENT’S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

WESTROCK COMPANY

Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements

The management of WestRock Company is responsible for the preparation and integrity of the consolidated financial statements 
appearing in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. The financial statements were prepared in conformity with GAAP appropriate in 
the circumstances and, accordingly, include certain amounts based on our best judgments and estimates. Financial information in 
this Annual Report on Form 10-K is consistent with that in the financial statements.

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management of our company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting 
as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to 
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the consolidated financial 
statements. Our internal control over financial reporting is supported by a program of internal audits and appropriate reviews by 
management, written policies and guidelines, careful selection and training of qualified personnel and a written code of conduct 
adopted by our board of directors that is applicable to all officers and employees of our Company and subsidiaries, as well as a 
code of conduct that is applicable to all of our directors.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and even 
when determined to be effective, can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and 
presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become 
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2017. In making 
this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 
(COSO) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013 framework). The scope of our efforts to comply with Section 404 of 
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act with respect to fiscal 2017 included all of our operations other than those we acquired in fiscal 2017 
related to the MPS Acquisition, the U.S. Corrugated Acquisition, the Island Container Acquisition, the Hannapak Acquisition and 
the Star Pizza Acquisition. In accordance with the SEC’s published guidance, because we acquired these operations during the 
fiscal year, we excluded these operations from our efforts to comply with Section 404 Rules with respect to fiscal 2017. Total 
assets as of September 30, 2017 and total revenues for the year ending September 30, 2017 for the MPS Acquisition, the U.S. 
Corrugated Acquisition, the Island Container Acquisition, the Hannapak Acquisition and the Star Pizza Acquisition were $3.6 
billion and $0.6 billion, respectively. SEC rules require that we complete our assessment of the internal control over financial 
reporting of the acquisitions within one year after the date of the acquisitions. Based on our assessment, management believes 
that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2017.

Our independent auditors, Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, are appointed by the Audit 
Committee of our board of directors. Ernst & Young LLP has audited and reported on the consolidated financial statements of 
WestRock Company, and has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The 
report of the independent registered public accounting firm is contained in this Annual Report.

Audit Committee Responsibility

The Audit Committee of our board of directors, composed solely of directors who are independent in accordance with the 
requirements  of  the  NYSE  listing  standards,  the  Exchange Act  and  our  Corporate  Governance  Guidelines,  meets  with  the 
independent auditors, management and internal auditors periodically to discuss internal control over financial reporting and auditing 
and financial reporting matters. The Audit Committee reviews with the independent auditors the scope and results of the audit 
effort.  The Audit  Committee  also  meets  periodically  with  the  independent  auditors  and  the  chief  internal  auditor  without 
management present to ensure that the independent auditors and the chief internal auditor have free access to the Audit Committee. 
Our Audit Committee’s Report will be contained in our definitive proxy statement issued in connection with our 2018 annual 
meeting of stockholders and is incorporated herein by reference.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL 
DISCLOSURE

There were no changes in or disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure.

Item 9A. 

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We maintain disclosure controls and other procedures that are designed with the objective of ensuring the following:

• 

• 

that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act are recorded, 
processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms; and

that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and 
communicated to our management, including our CEO and our CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding 
required disclosure.

We have performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures 
as of September 30, 2017, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO.  
Based on that evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of 
September 30, 2017, to provide reasonable assurance that we record, process, summarize and report the information we must 
disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms.

In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, 
no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, as 
ours are designed to do. Management also noted that the design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain 
assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and that there can be no assurance that any such design will succeed in achieving 
its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. Management necessarily was required to apply its 
judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The report called for by Item 308(a) of Regulation S-K is incorporated herein by reference to Management’s Annual Report 

on Internal Control over Financial Reporting of WestRock Company, included in Part II, Item 8 of this report.

The attestation report called for by Item 308(b) of Regulation S-K is incorporated herein by reference to the Report of 
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, included in Part II, Item 8 of this 
report.

Management has evaluated, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, changes in our internal controls over financial 
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2017. In connection with 
that evaluation, we have determined that there was no change in internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter 
that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

CEO and CFO Certifications

Our CEO and CFO have filed with the SEC the certifications required by Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as Exhibits 
31.1 and 31.2, respectively, to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, on February 17, 2017, our CEO certified to the 
NYSE that he was not aware of any violation by the Company of the NYSE corporate governance listing standards as in effect 
on February 17, 2017. The foregoing certification was unqualified.

Appendix A

Non-GAAP Measures and Reconciliations

We have included in the 2017 Annual Report financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as 
an alternative for, our GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial measures we present may differ from similarly captioned measures 
presented by other companies.

Below, we define the non-GAAP financial measures we use, discuss the reasons that we believe this information is useful to 
management and may be useful to investors and provide reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly 
comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. 

Adjusted Segment EBITDA

WestRock uses “Adjusted Segment EBITDA”, along with other factors, to evaluate our segment performance against our 
peers. Management believes this measure is also useful to investors to evaluate WestRock’s performance relative to its peers. Set 
forth below is a reconciliation of Adjusted Segment EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, Segment income 
(in millions):

Adjusted Free Cash Flow

WestRock uses the non-GAAP financial measure “Adjusted Free Cash Flow”. Management believes this non-GAAP financial 
measure  provides  WestRock’s  board  of  directors,  investors,  potential  investors,  securities  analysts  and  others  with  useful 
information to evaluate its performance relative to other periods because it excludes certain cash restructuring and other costs, 
net of tax that management believes are not indicative of the ongoing operating results of the business. WestRock believes that 
the most directly comparable GAAP measure is “Net cash provided by operating activities”. Set forth below is a reconciliation 
of “Adjusted Free Cash Flow” to Net cash provided by operating activities (in millions):

Net cash provided by operating activities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $

Adjusted Operating Cash Flow

WestRock uses the non-GAAP financial measure “Adjusted Operating Cash Flow”. Management believes this non-GAAP 
financial measure provides WestRock’s board of directors, investors, potential investors, securities analysts and others with 
useful information to evaluate its performance relative to other periods because it excludes certain cash restructuring and other 

A- 1

costs, net of tax that management believes are not indicative of the ongoing operating results of the business. While somewhat 
similar to Adjusted Free Cash Flow, WestRock believes Adjusted Operating Cash Flow provides greater comparability across 
years when capital expenditures are changing as it excludes an adjustment for capital expenditures. WestRock believes that the 
most directly comparable GAAP measure is “Net cash provided by operating activities”. Set forth below is a reconciliation of 
“Adjusted Operating Cash Flow” to Net cash provided by operating activities (in millions):

Net cash provided by operating activities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $

Forward-looking Guidance

See “Forward-Looking Information” in our annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of our use of forward-looking 

statements.  

In addition to forward looking statements related to fiscal 2018 that were included in our annual report on Form 10-K (e.g., 
that we expect net sales to increase by 10% to $16.3 billion, our adjusted operating cash flow to increase by 15% to $2.3 billion 
and our adjusted segment EBITDA to increase by 20% to $2.8 billion), this 2017 Annual Report includes additional forward-
looking statements that were not included in our annual report on Form 10-K (e.g., that we expect to generate more than $5 billion 
of capital through 2022 to invest back into our business to improve our margins, build scale and grow our portfolio of differentiated 
paper and packaging solutions and that we have the opportunity to increase adjusted segment EBITDA to more than $4 billion in 
fiscal 2022). In addition to the risks that are outlined in our annual report on Form 10-K that could impact our future performance 
and cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements, key assumptions related to 
forward looking statements presented in this 2017 Annual Report include, but are not limited to, stable pricing, normal inflation 
offset by ongoing productivity and incremental returns from high-return projects and acquisitions.

This 2017 Annual Report includes forward looking guidance related to non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted 
operating cash flow and adjusted segment EBITDA. We are not providing forward-looking guidance related to U.S. GAAP financial 
measures or reconciliations of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure 
because of the inherent difficulty in predicting the occurrence, the financial impact and the periods in which potential non-GAAP 
adjustments may be recognized (e.g., acquisition and integration-related expenses, restructuring expenses, asset impairments, 
litigation settlements, changes to contingent consideration and certain other gains or losses). For the same reason, we are unable 
to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and 
could have a material impact on U.S. GAAP reported results for the guidance period.
