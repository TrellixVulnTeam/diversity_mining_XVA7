To Our Shareholders

“ In a year of unprecedented 
weather, and in a period impacted 
by historically low interest rates 
and pricing below loss cost inflation, 
Travelers delivered more than 
$2 billion in profit and a 9% core 
return on equity.”

In a year of unprecedented weather, and in a period impacted by historically low interest 
rates and pricing below loss cost inﬂ ation, Travelers delivered more than $2 billion in 
proﬁ t and a 9% core return on equity.1 These results are a testament to the earnings 
power of our franchise, built on our rock-solid foundation of underwriting, claims 
handling and investment expertise.

Our success in 2017 was enabled by our formidable competitive advantages and the 
investments we have made in them over many years. That is a good reminder that 
the investments we are making today will ensure that our competitive advantages remain 
relevant and differentiating tomorrow. 

And as much as we are focused on tomorrow, we understand that if we do not continue 
to perform in the present, we will never have the opportunity to transform for the future. 
That is why my call to action to our 30,000 employees has been: perform and transform. 
In this letter, I will share with you how we are thinking about both of these imperatives.

But ﬁ rst, a review of last year’s results.

2017 results

In a year of challenging circumstances, we generated core 
income of $2.04 billion, or $7.28 per diluted share, and 
core return on equity of 9.0% — a meaningful spread 
over the 10-year Treasury and above our cost of equity. 
We also grew book value per share by 5%, after returning 
nearly $2.25 billion of excess capital to our shareholders 
and making strategic investments in our business. 

Particularly in light of a severe catastrophe season, we 
were pleased with our underwriting proﬁ t as evidenced 
by our consolidated combined ratio of 97.9%. We have 
deep underwriting talent, and we have been methodical 
in incorporating lessons learned over the years from 
events like Hurricane Katrina and Storm Sandy into our 
catastrophe underwriting. Those lessons are reﬂ ected 
in our:

•  Disciplined approach to terms and conditions, 

which makes outcomes more predictable;

•  Risk control initiatives, which make a difference in 

risk mitigation, selection and pricing; and

•  Proprietary catastrophe peril underwriting at the 
address level, which provides an edge with important 
and reliable information.

Our catastrophe underwriting results also reﬂ ect 
years of strategic investments in our unique claims 
handling model, as well as the dedication and 
compassion of our claim professionals. Hurricane 
Irma, the most intense hurricane to make landfall 
on the continental United States in more than a 
decade, came immediately on the heels of Hurricane 
Harvey, one of the most destructive ﬂ ood events in 
U.S. history. Without breaking stride, we handled 
tens of thousands of claims. State-of-the-art logistics 
capabilities and a highly sophisticated cross-training 
strategy positioned us to handle virtually 100% of our 
customers’ claims from these storms with our own 
claim professionals. As a result, we responded quickly 
to our customers’ needs, closing more than 90% of 
our property claims following Hurricanes Harvey and 
Irma within 30 days of the events. Our claims handling 
capability is a competitive advantage that results 
in a better outcome for our customers and a more 
efficient outcome for us.

our business segments. Our commercial businesses once 
again performed well, with strong underlying combined 
ratios of 94.9% in Business Insurance and 83.2% in Bond 
& Specialty Insurance. In Personal Insurance, we achieved 
an underlying combined ratio of 91.5%, notwithstanding 
the impact of proﬁ tability challenges in our Auto business 
arising from the increase in bodily injury losses we 
identiﬁ ed at the end of 2016. 

Importantly, our proﬁ tability also beneﬁ ted from an 
80 basis point improvement year-over-year in our 
expense ratio, as we grew the top line, made important 
investments in ongoing and new strategic initiatives, and 
delivered on our objective of improving productivity and 
efficiency through technology and workﬂ ow.

“We responded quickly 
to our customers’ needs, 
closing more than 90% of 
our property claims following 
Hurricanes Harvey and Irma 
within 30 days of the events.”

The execution of our marketplace strategies was also 
excellent in 2017. We generated record net written 
premiums of $26.2 billion, up 5% from 2016, with each 
of our business segments contributing to the growth.

In Business Insurance, net written premiums were up 
3% over the prior year. Domestic renewal premium 
change2 increased throughout 2017, reaching 4% in 
the fourth quarter, its highest level in three years. We 
achieved this price improvement while maintaining 
retention at a historically high level and adding almost 
$2 billion of new business. Our production results 
beneﬁ ted from technology, tools and process initiatives 
that we have been rolling out for several years, as 
we discussed at our Investor Day last fall. Our results 
also demonstrate that franchise value matters to our 
customers and distribution partners.

We also delivered an underlying combined ratio of 92.6% 
with excellent underlying underwriting results in each of 

Our marketplace execution in Bond & Specialty 
Insurance was similarly successful. We grew net

written premiums by 4%, driven by growth in both our 
domestic Surety and Management Liability businesses. 
In our domestic Management Liability business, we 
improved renewal premium change by more than 
3%, while maintaining retention at a historic high 
throughout the year and growing new business.

In Personal Insurance, net written premiums were up 
9%. We achieved our dual objectives of continued 
growth in our industry-leading Homeowners business, 
where policies in force were up more than 5%, and 
improved pricing and proﬁ tability in our Auto business. 
We are also pleased to have introduced our newest 
Homeowners product, Quantum Home 2.0SM.

During 2017, we realigned our international businesses 
so that instead of managing them on a geographic 
basis, we manage them as part of the three segments 
through which we currently report our results. By 
removing geographic barriers, we can better leverage 
our considerable U.S. domestic capabilities and 
expertise; more effectively seek opportunities for 
growth; improve our ability to attract world-class 
talent in each of our geographies; and acquire, develop 
and test important new capabilities.

As for our investment results, our high-quality investment 
portfolio generated net investment income of $2.4 billion 
pre-tax ($1.9 billion after-tax) in 2017. We are disciplined 
underwriters on both sides of our balance sheet, and 
we manage our investment portfolio to support our 

insurance operations — not the other way around. Our 
asset allocation and commitment to achieving appropriate 
risk-adjusted returns have served us remarkably well over 
many years. This strategy has resulted in net investment 
income that has been a reliable contributor year in and 
year out to the high level and low volatility of our industry-
leading returns.

Consistent and successful 
long-term ﬁ nancial strategy 
delivers shareholder value 
At Travelers, our simple and unwavering mission for 
creating shareholder value is to:
•  Deliver superior returns on equity by leveraging our 

competitive advantages;

•  Generate earnings and capital substantially in excess of 

our growth needs; and

•  Thoughtfully rightsize capital and grow book value per 

share over time.

Our 2017 return on equity of 8.7% and core return on 
equity of 9.0% stand in stark contrast to the average 
return on equity for the domestic property and casualty 
industry, which was approximately 3.6% in 2017 according 
to estimates from the Insurance Information Institute. As 
shown in the accompanying chart, our return on equity 
has meaningfully outperformed the average return on 
equity for the industry in each of the past 10 years.

Importantly, over this 10-year time period, our 
return on equity has also been less volatile than that 
of others in the property and casualty industry. The 
level and consistency of our return on equity over 
time reﬂ ect the value of our competitive advantages 
and demonstrate the discipline with which we run 
our business. 

Our ﬁ nancial success and balance sheet strength have 
enabled us to grow dividends per share at an average 
annual rate of 10% and increase our book value per 
share by 107%, in each case over the last 10 years — 
and that is on top of returning more than $40 billion of 
excess capital to our shareholders since we began our 
share repurchase program in 2006. 

Our stock also continued to perform well in 2017, 
with a total return to shareholders, including share 
appreciation and dividends, of approximately 13%. 
Over the past decade, our total return to shareholders 
of over 220% outperformed the Dow 30, the S&P 500 
and the S&P Financials.

Looking ahead: Perform
Our long-term ﬁ nancial strategy has been successful 
and will continue to serve as the road map for our 

perform imperative and the measure of our ﬁ nancial 
success. Looking ahead, I would like to share a few 
thoughts on three topics related to our performance 
that I am asked about frequently: our marketplace 
strategy, our capital management strategy and our 
acquisition strategy.

Our marketplace strategy is straightforward: we 
seek to retain our best business, improve the 
proﬁ tability of the business that is not meeting our 
return objectives and create opportunities to write 
attractive new business. This strategy will result in 
different priorities from time to time depending on 
marketplace dynamics. Since late 2016, for example, 
a principal objective of our domestic Business 
Insurance business has been to seek pricing gains to 
improve the outlook for proﬁ tability. The success 
we have achieved in meeting this objective has been 
due in large part to our franchise value. Put simply, 
we have the products, services and capabilities that 
our customers want to buy and that our agent and 
broker partners want to sell. Importantly, we have 
also developed superior data and analytic capabilities 
over decades that put essential information at the 
ﬁ ngertips of our frontline underwriters and product 
managers, allowing them to make disciplined, 
return-oriented underwriting decisions consistent 

4 

TR AV ELERS 2017 ANNUAL REPORT

with our marketplace strategy. We have a culture of 
balancing the science and art of risk-based decision 
making based on data and analytics; it is a competitive 
advantage and one we believe is very hard to replicate.

“ We have the products, 
services and capabilities 
that our customers want to 
buy and that our agent and 
broker partners want to sell.”

In the second half of 2017, we achieved accelerating 
pricing gains. Severe hurricanes and wildﬁ res were no 
doubt one factor inﬂ uencing the pricing environment. 
Big events impact pricing when a material amount of 
industry surplus is eroded and/or when the events 
change the market’s view of risk. It is not hard to make 
the case that in 2017 we experienced both. 

However, a second — and I believe more signiﬁ cant — 
factor impacting the pricing environment is that 
industry returns have been declining generally for a 
number of years due to historically low interest rates 
and loss cost inﬂ ation outpacing pricing gains. 

The pricing gains we achieved in 2017 were a 
good start. Also, U.S. corporate tax reform, rising 
reinvestment rates for our ﬁ xed income portfolio and 
the prospect of higher levels of economic growth are 
winds at our back in terms of proﬁ tability. 

However, our work to improve the outlook for 
returns is not complete. We price our products with a 
return objective in mind. The price increases we have 
achieved, a lower U.S. corporate tax rate and higher 
levels of net investment income are just three factors 
impacting our marketplace strategy. Others include 
the adequacy of expiring prices, loss cost inﬂ ation, 
expenses, capital requirements, the impact of claims 
initiatives and our cost of capital. 

For Travelers, tax reform and higher levels of 
net investment income will help shrink, but not 
completely close, the gap between where our 
returns are trending and where we would like them 
to be trending. Accordingly, we will continue to 
seek to improve the outlook for returns. We will do 
so in close coordination with our agent and broker 
partners by selectively and thoughtfully seeking 
price increases. We believe our customers are best 
served by a predictable and stable market, and, as a 
consequence, we favor gradual and manageable price 
increases to avoid disruption. As always, we will also 
actively continue to manage all of the other levers of 
proﬁ tability available to us.

I would also like to comment on how corporate tax 
reform will impact our capital management and 
acquisition strategies. 

We are not changing our capital management 
strategy. Our ﬁ rst objective for the capital we 
generate is to reinvest it in our business to create 
shareholder value. We will continue to retain capital 
to support growth that meets our disciplined 
standards. We also have an ambitious innovation 
agenda. We are making strategic investments in 
everything from talent to technology, and with the 
beneﬁ t of tax reform, we are accelerating some of 
these investments. Beyond that, to the extent we 
continue to generate excess capital, we will manage 
it the same way we have for more than a decade — 
we will return it to shareholders through dividends 
and share repurchases. In other words, as a result 
of tax reform, we expect to have higher earnings 
and therefore more capital to evaluate through that 
framework, but the framework will not change. 

With regard to acquisitions, tax reform has leveled 
the playing ﬁ eld, making us a more competitive buyer 
relative to non-U.S. companies that previously had 
the beneﬁ t of signiﬁ cant structural tax advantages. 
Having said that, our lens for assessing transactions 
and our propensity to do them remain the same. We 
will continue to look for opportunities that improve 
our long-term return proﬁ le, lower our volatility or 
create shareholder value by providing us with other 
important strategic beneﬁ ts.

Our Competitive Advantages

Our competitive advantages serve as a foundation for what has set us apart: deep expertise 
in understanding risk and the products and services our customers need to manage risk.

Talent and Tenure 
Our 500 most senior leaders have an average 
tenure at Travelers of nearly 20 years. It is an 
extraordinarily talented and committed leadership 
team, and because of that we have a culture of 
excellence that is committed to long-term success. 
We are also only as good as our ability to continue 
to attract and retain leading and emerging talent 
both from within our industry and from disciplines 
like artiﬁ cial intelligence and behavioral analytics 
that are fundamental to our future. You cannot 
underestimate the importance of talent and 
culture in a business where success and failure are 
determined by balancing risk and reward.

Data and Analytics 
Data and analytics have long been core components 
of our business. From the development and delivery 
of our products and services, to risk selection, 
underwriting and pricing, to the ways we interact 
with our customers and distribution partners, 
data inﬂ uences the decisions we make and drives 
innovation throughout the organization. We have 
more than 1,200 people working in analytics, 
including hundreds of actuaries, data scientists and 
statisticians. We are accelerating the transformation 
of data into actionable insights through the use 
of existing and emerging technologies, including 
artiﬁ cial intelligence tools and techniques. 

Product Breadth and Specialization 
We engage broadly across the seven major lines of 
insurance, and we are the only commercial insurer 
with a top-ﬁ ve position in ﬁ ve of the seven.* Our 
portfolio is balanced across these lines of business 
and further diversiﬁ ed by geography, customer 
size and our deep underwriting specialization. 

Additionally, our Personal Insurance business has 
excellent positioning in the independent agency 
channel and has a balanced mix of Personal Auto, 
Homeowners and Specialty business. 

Distribution Relationships
Domestically, given the franchise value we bring, 
we are the carrier of choice among independent 
agencies and brokers. We have active relationships 
with more than 100,000 producers working at more 
than 10,000 ﬁ rms. These producers have a deep 
understanding of customer needs, and they provide 
insights that are a valuable part of our underwriting 
and risk selection process. 

Risk Mitigation and Improvement 
Our expertise in risk control is delivered through 
more than 700 risk control professionals, most of 
whom are engineers and industry specialists. We 
complete more than 60,000 risk surveys annually, 
which contributes to a unique risk assessment 
database we have assembled over the past decade. 
We leverage this resource not just for risk mitigation 
but also for risk selection and pricing. 

Claim Services 
Our more than 10,000 dedicated claim professionals 
are trained to deliver high-quality service and handle 
claims efficiently and with compassion. Our claim 
team includes more than 800 highly tenured experts 
on high-severity claims; more than 650 nurses who 
make a difference for injured employees and their 
employers; and more than 650 staff counsel who 
produce a better outcome for our customers and 
for us. Our ﬂ exible model gives us the capacity 
to handle multiple and simultaneous catastrophe 
events with our own employees.

Looking ahead: Transform
Our competitive advantages set us apart; they are 
foundational to the success of our long-term ﬁ nancial 
strategy. Nonetheless, we understand clearly that the 
world is changing, and changing quickly.

Broadly speaking, we see four signiﬁ cant forces of 
change impacting our industry:
•  Consumers’ expectations are changing and being 
shaped by their experiences in other industries. 

•  Rapid progress in technology is enabling us to 

reimagine just about every aspect of our business. 

•  The opportunities presented by data and analytics 

are becoming even more consequential.

•  Traditional distribution is consolidating and 

alternative models are developing.

We are focused intently on these forces of change. 
While our long-term ﬁ nancial strategy is not changing, 
the competitive advantages that have fueled our 
success over the last decade will not necessarily be 
the same as those we will need to continue to lead for 
the next decade. That is the focus of our innovation 
agenda: making sure that our competitive advantages 
are as relevant and differentiating tomorrow as 
they are today. That is what transformation means 
for Travelers. 

Ultimately, the vision for our innovation agenda is to 
be the undeniable choice for the customer and an 
indispensable partner for our agents and brokers. To 
that end, we have three key organizational priorities: 
•  Extend our advantage in risk expertise. We 
are investing in intelligent automation, data and 
analytics, and predictive modeling, to name a few.

•  Provide great experiences for our customers, 

agents and brokers. We are investing in 
technologies, capabilities and talent to become 
faster, easier, nimbler, more digital, more mobile 
and more personalized. 

•  Optimize productivity and efficiency. We are 
investing in technology and workflow. Enhanced 
operating leverage provides us with the flexibility 
to let the savings fall to the bottom line, reinvest 
the savings and/or compete on price without 
compromising our return objectives.

A key theme running through our investments is that 
they are designed in large part to enable us to optimize 
the top line at attractive returns. Importantly, these 
are not just ideas in the form of blueprints sitting on a 
drawing board. We have been investing in these priorities 
for several years, while delivering industry-leading returns 
and an improving expense ratio. During 2017, we began 
to see beneﬁ ts from these investments in the form of 
a higher top line as well as general and administrative 
expenses that have been about ﬂ at for the past few years. 

“ The vision for our 
innovation agenda is to 
be the undeniable choice 
for the customer and an 
indispensable partner for our 
agents and brokers.”

We are undertaking this work from a position of 
strength. We have the resources and expertise to be 
successful, and we beneﬁ t from a lack of distraction. 
Moreover, our business is complex, and the value of 
deep domain expertise in understanding risk and the 
products and services our customers need to manage 
that risk cannot be underestimated as the starting 
point for innovation. We believe the winners in our 
industry will be those who can innovate successfully on 
top of a foundation of excellence.

Since I began communicating our perform and 
transform imperative, our employees — our greatest 
asset — have become its biggest champions. I am 
inspired by their dedication, the wisdom of their 
experience and their innovative spirit and ideas. 

We recognize that to deliver on our promise to 
customers and produce industry-leading returns over 
time, we need to maintain our talent advantage. We 
do so with competitive compensation programs that 
are designed to attract, motivate and retain the best 
people; development programs that foster personal 
and professional growth; and a focus on diversity and 
inclusion as a business imperative.

Sustaining Our Communities

We believe in being a good corporate citizen and actively contributing to the vitality and 
resilience of the communities we serve. From our wide-ranging civic and charitable endeavors 
to our commitment to the environment and sustainable practices, we are dedicated to fostering 
strong, thriving communities.

Education
•  Travelers EDGE (Empowering Dreams for 

Graduation and Employment), our signature 
education initiative, aims to increase access 
to education for underrepresented students 
and prepare them for careers in the ﬁ nancial 
services industry. 

•  Since its inception in 2007, 73% of participants 

have obtained or are pursuing bachelor’s degrees. 

Environment and Sustainability
•  All Travelers-owned campuses are ENERGY 

STAR® certiﬁ ed. 

•  We partner with Habitat for Humanity® and the 
Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety 
to construct affordable, fortiﬁed homes in 
coastal areas. 

•  Travelers has sponsored a comprehensive Coastal 

Wind Zone Plan to address the sustainability of 
coastal insurance since 2009.

Travelers Institute®
•  We strengthen our communities by participating 

in the public policy dialogue through the 
Travelers Institute.

•  For example, “Every Second Matters” — our 

nationwide distracted driving awareness initiative 
launched in 2017 — addresses the growing threat 
to life, safety and property.

Social Responsibility
•  From charitable giving and employee volunteer 

activities to signature philanthropic programs like 
the Travelers Championship, we are dedicated 
to supporting the communities in which we live 
and work.

•  The 2017 Travelers Championship generated 
$1.7 million for more than 165 charities. Since 
Travelers became the title sponsor in 2007, the 
Travelers Championship has distributed more than 
$14.7 million to more than 750 charities.

In partnership with KaBOOM!, hundreds of Travelers employees and 
independent agents helped build six playgrounds across the United States 
throughout the year.

•  Our employees also volunteered in their 

communities — logging more than 
143,000 hours in 2017.

Sustaining our communities 
We do not just cover our communities with our 
insurance policies, we cover them with our commitment 
to their success. Our corporate and employee giving 
are key elements in the sustainability of our success. We 
are supporting the places where we live and work, and 
we do so in part because they do so much to support 
us. We also see our work in our communities as an 
expression of our values. It motivates and energizes our 
30,000 employees. 

In 2017, Travelers and the Travelers Foundation 
provided more than $22 million of support to worthy 
causes, bringing our corporate giving over the last 10 
years to more than $200 million. On top of that, our 
employees logged over 143,000 volunteer hours during 
the year — the most ever — and our employee giving 
campaign generated $5.4 million for local communities. 

While Travelers employees volunteer for, and give to, 
hundreds of different organizations that are meaningful 
to them, our corporate philanthropy is focused on 
three main objectives: academic and career success; 
thriving neighborhoods; and culturally enriched 
communities. We proﬁ le some of these initiatives on 
the opposite page.

All of these efforts support our belief that we cannot 
have a strong business if our communities are not 
strong and the people who call those communities 
home do not have economic opportunity and pathways 
to success.

Our enduring promise 
At the end of a year, it is tempting to tally everything 
up — every policy written, every risk assessed, every 
claim closed — in terms of dollars and cents earned. 
While that is important, it misses an essential point about 
our business and our company.

I have said many times that our expertise in risk enables 
us to deliver the dollars and cents. That is the core of 
who we are. But at the heart of who we are is a promise. 
A promise to take care of our customers. In the end, that 
is what we sell. We work hard to make sure our agent and 
broker partners are proud to sell that promise and our 
customers are happy that they bought it. 

The power of the core and the heart, and the 
inextricable link between them, were on full display 
this year. In crisis after crisis, we followed right behind 
the ﬁ rst responders who heroically saved lives, and 
we restored hope and rebuilt livelihoods. Through the 
expertise, sheer grit and determination of committed 
Travelers employees, our work resulted in many 
thousands of homes rebuilt, businesses reopened and 
cars back on the road. Customers of ours in Texas and 
Florida were able to celebrate the holiday season in 
their own dining rooms and living rooms because they 
bought a Travelers insurance policy.

Our promise extends beyond taking care of our 
customers. It also means taking care of our communities 
and each other, our Travelers colleagues, because 
building a successful and sustainable business depends 
on all three. 

It is the core and heart together — taking care of all 
our stakeholders — that enable us to deliver on our 
mission of creating shareholder value. And it is only 
by delivering on that mission that we will be able to 
continue to invest in maintaining a healthy core and to 
make good on our promise. It is a virtuous cycle, and 
all the elements were on full display in 2017. 

As we look back on a year in which Travelers rose to 
the occasion and look ahead to the opportunities 
and challenges on the horizon, I am enormously 
grateful for the counsel and commitment of our Board 
of Directors, the dedication and passion of every 
Travelers employee, the partnership and insight of our 
agents and brokers, the customers we are privileged to 
serve and the support of our shareholders. 

Sincerely,

PART I

Item 1. BUSINESS

The Travelers Companies, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the Company) is a

holding company principally engaged, through its subsidiaries, in providing a wide range of commercial
and personal property and casualty insurance products and services to businesses, government units,
associations and individuals. The Company is incorporated as a general business corporation under the
laws of the State of Minnesota and is one of the oldest insurance organizations in the United States,
dating back to 1853. The principal executive offices of the Company are located at 485 Lexington
Avenue, New York, New York 10017, and its telephone number is (917) 778-6000. The Company also
maintains executive offices in Hartford, Connecticut, and St. Paul, Minnesota. The term ‘‘TRV’’ in this
document refers to The Travelers Companies, Inc., the parent holding company excluding subsidiaries.

For a summary of the Company’s revenues, core income and total assets by reportable business

segments, see note 2 of notes to the consolidated financial statements.

PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE OPERATIONS

The property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive in the areas of price, service,

product offerings, agent relationships and methods of distribution. Distribution methods include the use
of independent agents, exclusive agents, direct marketing and/or salaried employees. According to A.M.
Best, there are approximately 1,200 property and casualty groups in the United States, comprising
approximately 2,630 property and casualty companies. Of those groups, the top 150 accounted for
approximately 92% of the consolidated industry’s total net written premiums in 2016. The Company
competes with both foreign and domestic insurers. In addition, several property and casualty insurers
writing commercial lines of business, including the Company, offer products for alternative forms of
risk protection in addition to traditional insurance products. These products include large deductible
programs and various forms of self-insurance, some of which utilize captive insurance companies and
risk retention groups. The Company’s competitive position in the marketplace is based on many factors,
including the following:

(cid:127) ability to profitably price business, retain existing customers and obtain new business;
(cid:127) premiums charged, contract terms and conditions, products and services offered (including the

ability to design customized programs);

(cid:127) agent, broker and policyholder relationships;
(cid:127) ability to keep pace relative to competitors with changes in technology and information systems;
(cid:127) speed of claims payment;
(cid:127) ability to provide products and services in a cost effective manner;
(cid:127) ability to provide new products and services to meet changing customer needs;
(cid:127) ability to adapt to changes in business models, technology, customer preferences or regulation

impacting the markets in which the Company operates;

(cid:127) perceived overall financial strength and corresponding ratings assigned by independent rating

agencies;

(cid:127) reputation, experience and qualifications of employees;
(cid:127) geographic scope of business; and
(cid:127) local presence.

3

In addition, the marketplace is affected by the available capacity of the insurance industry, as
measured by statutory capital and surplus, and the availability of reinsurance from both traditional
sources, such as reinsurance companies and capital markets (through catastrophe bonds), and
non-traditional sources, such as hedge funds and pension plans. Industry capacity as measured by
statutory capital and surplus expands and contracts primarily in conjunction with profit levels generated
by the industry, less amounts returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
Capital raised by debt and equity offerings may also increase statutory capital and surplus.

Pricing and Underwriting

Pricing of the Company’s property and casualty insurance products is generally developed based
upon an estimation of expected losses, the expenses associated with producing, issuing and servicing
business and managing claims, the time value of money related to the expected loss and expense cash
flows, and a reasonable profit margin that considers the capital needed to support the Company’s
business. The Company has a disciplined approach to underwriting and risk management that
emphasizes product returns and profitable growth over the long-term rather than premium volume or
market share. The Company’s insurance subsidiaries are subject to state laws and regulations regarding
rate and policy form approvals. The applicable state laws and regulations establish standards in certain
lines of business to ensure that rates are not excessive, inadequate, unfairly discriminatory, or used to
engage in unfair price competition. The Company’s ability to increase rates and the relative timing of
the process are dependent upon each respective state’s requirements, as well as the competitive market
environment.

Catastrophe Exposure

The Company’s property and casualty insurance operations expose it to claims arising out of

catastrophes. The Company uses various analyses and methods, including proprietary and third-party
computer modeling processes, to continually monitor and analyze underwriting risks of business in
natural catastrophe-prone areas and target risk areas for conventional terrorist attacks (defined as
attacks other than nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological events). The Company relies, in part,
upon these analyses to make underwriting decisions designed to manage its exposure on catastrophe-
exposed business. For example, as a result of these analyses, the Company has at various times limited
the writing of new property and homeowners business in some markets and has selectively taken
underwriting actions on new and existing business. These underwriting actions on new and existing
business include tightening underwriting standards, selective price increases and changes to deductibles
specific to hurricane-, tornado-, wind- and hail-prone areas. See ‘‘Item 7—Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Catastrophe Modeling’’ and
‘‘—Changing Climate Conditions.’’ The Company also utilizes reinsurance to manage its aggregate
exposures to catastrophes. See ‘‘—Reinsurance.’’

Segment Realignment

Effective April 1, 2017, the Company’s results are reported in the following three business

segments—Business Insurance, Bond & Specialty Insurance and Personal Insurance, reflecting a change
in the manner in which the Company’s businesses were being managed as of that date, as well as the
aggregation of products and services based on the type of customer, how the business is marketed and
the manner in which risks are underwritten. While the segmentation of the Company’s domestic
businesses was unchanged, the Company’s international businesses, which were previously managed and
reported in total within the Business and International Insurance segment, were disaggregated by
product type among the three newly aligned reportable business segments. In connection with these
changes, the Company revised the names and descriptions of certain businesses comprising the
Company’s segments and has reflected other related changes. The following discussion of the
Company’s reportable business segments reflects the realigned segment reporting structure. Financial
data for all prior periods presented was reclassified to be consistent with the 2017 presentation.

BUSINESS INSURANCE

Business Insurance offers a broad array of property and casualty insurance and insurance-related

services to its customers, primarily in the United States, as well as in Canada, the United Kingdom, the
Republic of Ireland, Brazil and throughout other parts of the world as a corporate member of Lloyd’s.
Business Insurance is organized as follows:

Domestic
(cid:127) Select Accounts provides small businesses with property and casualty insurance products and
services, including commercial multi-peril, workers’ compensation, commercial automobile,
general liability and commercial property.

(cid:127) Middle Market provides mid-sized businesses with property and casualty insurance products and
services, including workers’ compensation, general liability, commercial multi-peril, commercial
automobile and commercial property, as well as risk management, claims handling and other
services. Middle Market generally provides these products to mid-sized businesses through
Commercial Accounts, as well as to targeted industries through Construction, Technology, Public
Sector Services and Oil & Gas, and additionally, provides mono-line umbrella and excess coverage
insurance through Excess Casualty. Middle Market also provides insurance for goods in transit
and movable objects, as well as builders’ risk insurance, through Inland Marine; insurance for the

5

marine transportation industry and related services, as well as other businesses involved in
international trade, through Ocean Marine; and comprehensive breakdown for equipment,
including property and business interruption, through Boiler & Machinery.

(cid:127) National Accounts provides large companies with casualty insurance products and services,

including workers’ compensation, commercial automobile and general liability, generally utilizing
loss-sensitive products, on both a bundled and unbundled basis. National Accounts also includes
the Company’s commercial residual market business, which primarily offers workers’
compensation products and services to the involuntary market.

(cid:127) National Property and Other provides traditional and customized commercial property insurance

programs to large and mid-sized customers through National Property. National Property and
Other also provides insurance coverage for the commercial transportation industry through
Northland Transportation, general liability and commercial property policies for small, difficult to
place specialty classes of commercial business primarily on an excess and surplus lines basis
through Northfield, and tailored property and casualty insurance programs on an admitted basis
for customers with common risk characteristics or coverage requirements through National

including farms, ranches, wineries and related operations, through Agribusiness.

International
(cid:127) International, through its operations in Canada, the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland
and Brazil, provides property and casualty insurance and risk management services to several
customer groups, including, among others, those in the technology, manufacturing and public
services industry sectors. International also provides insurance for both the foreign exposures of
United States organizations and the United States exposures of foreign organizations through
Global Services. Through its Lloyd’s syndicate (Syndicate 5000), for which the Company provides
100% of the capital, International underwrites five principal businesses—marine, global property,
accident & special risks, power & utilities and aviation.

Business Insurance also includes Simply Business, a leading provider of small business insurance

policies in the United Kingdom that was acquired in August 2017, as well as Business Insurance Other,
which comprises the Special Liability Group (which manages the Company’s asbestos and
environmental liabilities) and the assumed reinsurance and certain other runoff operations.

Principal Markets and Methods of Distribution

Business Insurance markets and distributes its products through approximately 10,500 independent
agencies and brokers. Agencies and brokers are serviced by 114 field offices and three customer service
centers.

Business Insurance builds relationships with well-established, independent insurance agencies and

brokers. In selecting new independent agencies and brokers to distribute its products, Business
Insurance considers, among other attributes, each agency’s or broker’s financial strength, staff
experience and strategic fit with the Company’s operating and marketing plans. Once an agency or
broker is appointed, Business Insurance carefully monitors its performance. The majority of products
offered in the United States are distributed through independent agents and brokers, many of whom
also sell the Company’s Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance products. Additionally,
several operations may underwrite business with agents that specialize in servicing the needs of certain
of the industries served by these operations. Business Insurance continues to make significant
investments in enhanced technology to provide real-time interface capabilities with independent
agencies and brokers.

Domestic

(cid:127) Select Accounts markets and distributes its products and services to small businesses, generally

with fewer than 50 employees, through a large network of independent agents and brokers.
Products offered by Select Accounts are guaranteed-cost policies, including packaged products
covering property and liability exposures. Each small business risk is independently evaluated via
an automated underwriting platform which in turn enables agents to quote, bind and issue a
substantial amount of new small business risks at their desktop in an efficient manner that
significantly reduces the time period between quoting a price on a new policy and issuing that

7

policy. Risks with more complex characteristics are underwritten with the assistance of Company
personnel. Select Accounts has established a strong marketing relationship with its distribution
network and has provided this network with defined underwriting policies, a broad array of
products and competitive prices. In addition, the Company has established centralized service
centers to help agents perform many service functions, in return for a fee.

(cid:127) Middle Market markets and distributes its products and services primarily to mid-sized

businesses with 50 to 1,000 employees through a large network of independent agents and
brokers. The Company offers a full line of products to its Middle Market customers with an
emphasis on guaranteed-cost programs. Each account is underwritten based on the unique risk
characteristics, loss history and coverage needs of the account. The ability to underwrite at this
detailed level allows Middle Market to have a broad risk appetite and a diversified customer
base. Within Middle Market, products and services are tailored to certain targeted industry
segments of significant size and complexity that require unique underwriting, claim, risk
management or other insurance-related products and services.

(cid:127) National Accounts markets and distributes its products and services to large companies through

a network of national and regional brokers, primarily utilizing loss-sensitive products in
connection with a large deductible or self-insured program and, to a lesser extent, a
retrospectively rated or a guaranteed-cost insurance policy. National Accounts also provides
casualty products and services through retail brokers on an unbundled basis, using third-party
administrators for insureds who utilize programs such as collateralized deductibles, captive
reinsurers and self-insurance. National Accounts provides insurance-related services, such as risk
management services, claims administration, loss control and risk management information
services, either in addition to, or in lieu of, pure risk coverage, and generated $252 million of fee
income in 2017, excluding commercial residual market business. The commercial residual market
business of National Accounts sells claims and policy management services to workers’
compensation pools throughout the United States, and generated $120 million of fee income in
2017. National Accounts services approximately 36% of the total workers’ compensation assigned
risk market, making the Company one of the largest servicing carriers in the industry. Workers’
compensation accounted for approximately 71% of sales to National Accounts customers during
2017, based on direct written premiums and fees.

(cid:127) National Property and Other markets and distributes its products and services to a wide

customer base, providing traditional and customized insurance programs to a broad range of
customer sizes through a large network of agents and brokers. National Property and Other also
markets and distributes its products through brokers, wholesale agents, program managers and
specialized retail agents who operate in certain markets that are not typically served by the
Company’s appointed retail agents, or who maintain certain affinity arrangements in specialized
market segments. The wholesale excess and surplus lines market, which is characterized by the
absence of rate and form regulation, allows for more pricing and coverage flexibility to write
certain classes of business. In working with agents or program managers on a brokerage basis,
National Property and Other underwrites the business internally and sets the premium level. In
working with agents or program managers with delegated underwriting authority, the agents
produce and underwrite business subject to pricing and underwriting guidelines that have been
specifically designed for each facility or program.

International markets and distributes its products principally through brokers in each of the
countries in which it operates. International also writes business at Lloyd’s, where its products are
distributed through Lloyd’s wholesale and retail brokers. By virtue of Lloyd’s worldwide licenses,
Business Insurance has access to international markets across the world.

Pricing and Underwriting

Business Insurance utilizes underwriting, claims, engineering, actuarial and product development

disciplines for particular industries, in conjunction with extensive amounts of proprietary data gathered
and analyzed over many years, to facilitate its risk selection process and develop pricing parameters.
The Company utilizes both standard industry forms and proprietary forms for the insurance policies it
issues.

A portion of business in this segment, particularly in National Accounts and Construction, is

written with large deductible insurance policies. Under workers’ compensation insurance contracts with
large deductible features, the Company is obligated to pay the claimant the full amount of the claim.
The Company is subsequently reimbursed by the contractholder for the deductible amount and is
subject to credit risk until such reimbursement is made. At December 31, 2017, contractholder payables
on unpaid losses within the deductible layer of large deductible policies and the associated receivables
were both approximately $4.77 billion. Business Insurance also utilizes retrospectively rated policies for
another portion of the business, primarily for workers’ compensation coverage. Although the
retrospectively rated feature of the policy substantially reduces insurance risk for the Company, it
introduces additional credit risk to the Company. Premiums receivable from holders of retrospectively
rated policies totaled approximately $93 million at December 31, 2017. Significant collateral, primarily
letters of credit and, to a lesser extent, cash collateral, trusts or surety bonds, is generally obtained for
large deductible plans and/or retrospectively rated policies that provide for deferred collection of
deductible recoveries and/or ultimate premiums. The amount of collateral requested is predicated upon
the creditworthiness of the customer and the nature of the insured risks. Business Insurance continually
monitors the credit exposure on individual accounts and the adequacy of collateral. For additional
information concerning credit risk in certain of the Company’s businesses, see ‘‘Item 1A—Risk
Factors—We are also exposed to credit risk in certain of our insurance operations and with respect to
certain guarantee or indemnification arrangements that we have with third parties.’’

Product Lines

Business Insurance provides the following types of products and services:

Domestic

(cid:127) Workers’ Compensation. Provides coverage for employers for specified benefits payable under

state or federal law for workplace injuries to employees. There are typically four types of
benefits payable under workers’ compensation policies: medical benefits, disability benefits, death
benefits and vocational rehabilitation benefits. The Company emphasizes managed care cost
containment strategies, which involve employers, employees and care providers in a cooperative
effort that focuses on the injured employee’s early return to work and cost-effective quality care.
The Company offers the following types of workers’ compensation products:

(cid:127) guaranteed-cost insurance products, where the premiums charged will not be adjusted for

actual loss experience during the covered period;

(cid:127) loss-sensitive insurance products, including large deductible and retrospectively rated

policies, in which fees or premiums are adjusted based on actual loss experience of the
insured during the policy period; and

(cid:127) service programs, which are generally sold to the Company’s National Accounts customers,
where the Company receives fees rather than premiums for providing loss prevention, risk
management, and claim and benefit administration services to organizations under service
agreements.

The Company also participates in state assigned risk pools as a servicing carrier and pool
participant.

9

(cid:127) Commercial Automobile. Provides coverage for businesses against losses incurred from personal
bodily injury, bodily injury to third parties, property damage to an insured’s vehicle and property
damage to other vehicles and other property resulting from the ownership, maintenance or use
of automobiles and trucks in a business.

(cid:127) Commercial Property. Provides coverage for loss of or damage to buildings, inventory and

equipment from a variety of events, including, among others, hurricanes and other windstorms,
tornadoes, earthquakes, hail, wildfires, severe winter weather, floods, volcanic eruptions,
tsunamis, theft, vandalism, fires, explosions, terrorism and financial loss due to business
interruption resulting from covered property damage. For additional information on terrorism
coverages, see ‘‘Reinsurance—Catastrophe Reinsurance—Terrorism Risk Insurance Program.’’
Commercial property also includes specialized equipment insurance, which provides coverage for
loss or damage resulting from the mechanical breakdown of boilers and machinery, and ocean
and inland marine insurance, which provides coverage for goods in transit and unique,
one-of-a-kind exposures.

(cid:127) General Liability. Provides coverages for businesses against third-party claims arising from

accidents occurring on their premises or arising out of their operations, including as a result of
injuries sustained from products sold. Coverages may also include directors’ and officers’ liability
arising in their official capacities, employment practices liability insurance, fiduciary liability for
trustees and sponsors of pension, health and welfare, and other employee benefit plans, errors
and omissions insurance for employees, agents, professionals and others arising from acts or
failures to act under specified circumstances, as well as umbrella and excess insurance.
(cid:127) Commercial Multi-Peril. Provides a combination of the property and liability coverages

described in the foregoing product line descriptions.

International

(cid:127) Provides coverage for employers’ liability (similar to workers’ compensation coverage in the
United States), public and product liability (the equivalent of general liability), professional
indemnity (similar to professional liability coverage), commercial property, commercial
automobile, marine, aviation, personal accident and kidnap & ransom. Marine provides coverage
for ship hulls, cargoes carried, private yachts, marine-related liability, offshore energy, ports and
terminals, fine art and terrorism. Aviation provides coverage for worldwide aviation risks
including physical damage and liabilities for airline, aerospace, general aviation, aviation war and
space risks. Personal accident provides financial protection in the event of death or disablement
due to accidental bodily injury, while kidnap & ransom provides financial protection against
kidnap, hijack, illegal detention and extortion. While the covered hazards may be similar to
those in the U.S. market, the different legal environments can make the product risks and
coverage terms potentially very different from those the Company faces in the United States.

Net Retention Policy Per Risk

The following discussion reflects the Company’s retention policy with respect to Business Insurance

as of January 1, 2018. For third-party liability, Business Insurance generally limits its net retention,
through the use of reinsurance, to a maximum of $16.0 million per insured, per occurrence. For
property exposures, Business Insurance generally limits its net retention, through the use of
reinsurance, to a maximum amount per risk of $20.0 million per occurrence. Business Insurance
generally retains its workers’ compensation exposures. Reinsurance treaties often have aggregate limits
or caps which may result in larger net per-risk retentions if the aggregate limits or caps are reached.
Business Insurance utilizes facultative reinsurance to provide additional limits capacity or to reduce

10

retentions on an individual risk basis. Business Insurance may also retain amounts greater than those
described herein based upon the individual characteristics of the risk.

Competition

The insurance industry is represented in the commercial marketplace by many insurance

companies of varying size as well as other entities offering risk alternatives, such as self-insured
retentions or captive programs. Market competition works within the insurance regulatory framework to
set the price charged for insurance products and the levels of coverage and service provided. A
company’s success in the competitive commercial insurance landscape is largely measured by its ability
to profitably provide insurance and services, including claims handling and risk control, at prices and
terms that retain existing customers and attract new customers. See ‘‘Item 1A—Risk Factors—The
intense competition that we face, and the impact of innovation, technological change and changing
customer preferences on the insurance industry and the markets in which we operate, could harm our
ability to maintain or increase our business volumes and our profitability.’’

Domestic

Competitors typically write Select Accounts business through independent agents and, to a lesser
extent, regional brokers, and as direct writers. Both national (including international companies doing
business in the U.S.) and regional property and casualty insurance companies compete in the Select
Accounts market which generally comprises lower-hazard, ‘‘Main Street’’ business customers. Risks are
underwritten and priced using standard industry practices and a combination of proprietary and

11

standard industry product offerings. Competition in this market is primarily based on breadth of
product offerings, service levels, ease and speed of doing business and price.

Competitors typically write Middle Market business through independent agents and brokers.

Several of Middle Market’s operations require unique combinations of industry knowledge, customized
coverage, specialized risk control and loss handling services, along with partnerships with agents and
brokers that also focus on these markets. Competitors in this market are primarily national property
and casualty insurance companies (including international companies doing business in the U.S.) that
write most classes of business using traditional products and pricing, and regional insurance companies.
Companies compete based on product offerings, service levels, price and claim and loss prevention
services. Efficiency through automation and response time to agent, broker and customer needs is one
key to success in this market.

In the National Accounts market, competition is based on price, product offerings, claim and loss

prevention services, managed care cost containment, risk management information systems and
collateral requirements. National Accounts primarily competes with national property and casualty
insurance companies (including international companies doing business in the U.S.), as well as with
other underwriters of property and casualty insurance in the alternative risk transfer market, such as
self-insurance plans, captives managed by others, and a variety of other risk-financing vehicles and
mechanisms. The residual market division competes for state contracts to provide claims and policy
management services.

National Property and Other competes in focused target markets. Each of these markets is

different and requires unique combinations of industry knowledge, customized coverage, specialized risk
control and loss handling services, along with partnerships with agents and brokers that also focus on
these markets. Some of these businesses compete with national carriers (including international
companies doing business in the U.S.) with similarly dedicated underwriting and marketing groups,
whereas others compete with smaller regional companies. Specialized agents and brokers, including
wholesale agents and program managers, supplement this focused target market approach. National
Property and Other’s competitive strategy typically is based on the application of focused industry
knowledge to insurance and risk needs.

International

International competes with numerous international and domestic insurers in Canada, the United

Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland and Brazil. Companies compete on the basis of price, product
offerings, distribution partnerships and the level of claim and risk management services provided. The
Company has developed expertise in various markets in these countries similar to those served in the
United States and provides both property and casualty coverage for these markets.

At Lloyd’s, International competes with other syndicates operating in the Lloyd’s market as well as
international and domestic insurers in the various markets where the Lloyd’s operation writes business
worldwide. Competition is based on price, product and service. The Company focuses on lines it
believes it can underwrite profitably with an emphasis on short-tail insurance lines.

12

BOND & SPECIALTY INSURANCE

Bond & Specialty Insurance provides surety, fidelity, management liability, professional liability,

and other property and casualty coverages and related risk management services to its customers in the
United States and certain specialty insurance products in Canada, the United Kingdom, the Republic of
Ireland and Brazil, utilizing various degrees of financially based underwriting approaches. The range of
coverages includes performance, payment and commercial surety and fidelity bonds for construction
and general commercial enterprises; management liability coverages including directors’ and officers’
liability, employee dishonesty, employment practices liability, fiduciary liability and cyber risk for public
corporations, private companies, not-for-profit organizations and financial institutions; professional
liability coverage for a variety of professionals including, among others, lawyers and design
professionals; and in the United States only, property, workers’ compensation, auto and general liability
for financial institutions.

Bond & Specialty Insurance surety business in Brazil and Colombia is conducted through

J. Malucelli Participa¸c˜oes em Seguros e Resseguros S.A. (JMalucelli) and J. Malucelli Latam S.A. in
Brazil. The Company owns 49.5% of both JMalucelli, a market leader in surety coverages in Brazil, and
J. Malucelli Latam S.A., which in September 2015 acquired a majority interest in JMalucelli Travelers
Seguros S.A., a Colombian start-up surety provider. These joint venture investments are accounted for
using the equity method and are included in ‘‘other investments’’ on the consolidated balance sheet.

Principal Markets and Methods of Distribution

Bond & Specialty Insurance markets and distributes the vast majority of its products in the United

States through approximately 5,600 of the same independent agencies and brokers that distribute
Business Insurance’s products in the United States. Bond & Specialty Insurance builds relationships
with well-established, independent insurance agencies and brokers. In selecting new independent
agencies and brokers to distribute its products, Bond & Specialty Insurance considers, among other
attributes, each agency’s or broker’s profitability, financial stability, staff experience and strategic fit
with its operating and marketing plans. Once an agency or broker is appointed, its ongoing
performance is closely monitored. Bond & Specialty Insurance, in conjunction with Business Insurance,
continues to make investments in enhanced technology to provide real-time interface capabilities with
its independent agencies and brokers.

13

Pricing and Underwriting

Bond & Specialty Insurance utilizes underwriting, claims, engineering, actuarial and product

development disciplines for specific accounts and industries, in conjunction with extensive amounts of
proprietary data gathered and analyzed over many years, to facilitate its risk selection process and
develop pricing parameters. The Company utilizes both standard industry forms and proprietary forms
for the insurance policies it issues.

Product Lines

Bond & Specialty Insurance writes the following types of coverages:

Domestic
(cid:127) Fidelity and Surety. Provides fidelity insurance coverage, which protects an insured for loss due

to embezzlement or misappropriation of funds by an employee, and surety, which is a three-
party agreement whereby the insurer agrees to pay a third party or complete an obligation in
response to the default, acts or omissions of an insured. Surety is generally provided for
construction performance, legal matters such as appeals, trustees in bankruptcy and probate and
other performance bonds.

(cid:127) General Liability. Provides coverage for specialized liability exposures as described above in

more detail in the ‘‘Business Insurance’’ section of this report, as well as cyber risk coverages.

(cid:127) Other. Coverages include Property, Workers’ Compensation, Commercial Automobile and

Commercial Multi-Peril, which are described above in more detail in the ‘‘Business Insurance’’
section of this report.

International
(cid:127) Fidelity and Surety and certain General Liability products are provided internationally to various

customer groups.

Net Retention Policy Per Risk

The following discussion reflects the Company’s retention policy with respect to Bond & Specialty
Insurance as of January 1, 2018. For third party liability, including but not limited to umbrella liability,
professional liability, directors’ and officers’ liability, employment practices liability and cyber risk
liability, Bond & Specialty Insurance generally limits net retentions to $25.0 million per policy. For
surety protection, where insured limits are often significant, Bond & Specialty Insurance generally
retains up to $115.0 million probable maximum loss (PML) per principal, after reinsurance, but may
retain higher amounts based on the type of obligation, credit quality and other credit risk factors.
Reinsurance treaties often have aggregate limits or caps which may result in larger net per risk
retentions if the aggregate limits or caps are reached. Bond & Specialty Insurance utilizes facultative
reinsurance to provide additional limits capacity or to reduce retentions on an individual risk basis.
Bond & Specialty Insurance may also retain amounts greater than those described herein based upon
the individual characteristics of the risk.

Competition

The competitive landscape in which Bond & Specialty Insurance operates is affected by many of

the same factors described previously for Business Insurance. Competitors in this market are primarily
national property and casualty insurance companies (including international companies doing business
in the U.S.) that write most classes of business and, to a lesser extent, regional insurance companies
and companies that have developed niche programs for specific industry segments.

Domestic

Bond & Specialty Insurance underwrites and markets its products to all sizes of businesses and
other organizations, as well as individuals. The Company believes that its reputation for timely and
consistent decision making, a nationwide network of local underwriting, claims and industry experts and
strong producer and customer relationships, as well as its ability to offer its customers a full range of
products, provides Bond & Specialty Insurance an advantage over many of its competitors and enables
it to compete effectively in a complex, dynamic marketplace. The Company believes that the ability of
Bond & Specialty Insurance to cross-sell its products to customers of Business Insurance and Personal
Insurance provides additional competitive advantages for the Company. See ‘‘Item 1A—Risk Factors—
The intense competition that we face, and the impact of innovation, technological change and changing
customer preferences on the insurance industry and the markets in which we operate, could harm our
ability to maintain or increase our business volumes and our profitability.’’

15

International

International competes with numerous international and domestic insurers in Canada, the United

Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland and Brazil. Companies compete on the basis of price, product
offerings and the level of claim and risk management services provided. The Company has developed
expertise in various markets in these countries similar to those served in the United States and provides
certain specialty coverages for these markets.

PERSONAL INSURANCE

Personal Insurance writes a broad range of property and casualty insurance covering individuals’

personal risks, primarily in the United States, as well as in Canada. The primary products of
automobile and homeowners insurance are complemented by a broad suite of related coverages.

Principal Markets and Methods of Distribution

Domestic

Personal Insurance products are marketed and distributed primarily through approximately 10,300

active independent agencies located throughout the United States, supported by personnel in eight
sales regions. In addition, sales and service are provided to customers through five contact centers.
While the principal markets for Personal Insurance products continue to be in states along the East
Coast, California and Texas, the business continues to expand its geographic presence across the United
States.

In selecting new independent agencies to distribute its products, Personal Insurance considers,

among other attributes, each agency’s profitability, financial stability, staff experience and strategic fit
with its operating and marketing plans. Once an agency is appointed, Personal Insurance carefully
monitors its performance.

Agents can access the Company’s agency service portal for a number of resources including

customer service, marketing and claims management. In addition, agencies can choose to shift the
ongoing service responsibility for Personal Insurance’s customers to one of the Company’s Customer
Care Centers, where the Company provides, on behalf of an agency, a comprehensive array of

16

customer service needs, including response to billing and coverage inquiries, and policy changes.
Approximately 1,500 agents take advantage of this service alternative, for which they generally pay a
fee.

Personal Insurance also markets and distributes its products through additional channels, including
corporations that make the Company’s product offerings available to their employees primarily through
payroll deductions, consumer associations and affinity groups. Personal Insurance handles the sales and
service for these programs either through a sponsoring independent agent or through the Company’s
contact center locations. In addition, since 1995, the Company has had a marketing agreement with
GEICO to underwrite homeowners business for certain of their auto customers.

The Company also markets its insurance products directly to consumers, largely through online
channels. The Company’s direct-to-consumer business continues to grow but still represents modest
premium volume for Personal Insurance, which is expected to continue for a number of years. The
Company’s direct-to-consumer business is also expected to be slightly unprofitable for a number of
years.

International

International markets and distributes its products principally through approximately 640 brokers

located throughout Canada.

Pricing and Underwriting

Personal Insurance has developed a product management methodology that integrates the

disciplines of underwriting, claims, actuarial and product development. This approach is designed to
maintain high-quality underwriting discipline and pricing segmentation. Proprietary and third-party data
accumulated over many years is analyzed and Personal Insurance uses a variety of risk differentiation
models to facilitate its pricing segmentation and underwriting. The Company’s product management
area establishes underwriting guidelines integrated with its filed pricing and rating plans, which enable
Personal Insurance to effectively execute its risk selection and pricing processes.

Domestic

Pricing for personal automobile insurance is driven in large part by changes in the frequency of
claims and changes in severity, including inflation in the cost of automobile repairs, medical care and
resolution of liability claims. Pricing in the homeowners business is driven in large part by changes in
the frequency of claims and changes in severity, including inflation in the cost of building supplies,
labor and household possessions. In addition to the normal risks associated with any multiple peril
coverage, the profitability and pricing of both homeowners and automobile insurance are affected by
the incidence of natural disasters, particularly those related to weather and, for homeowners insurance,
earthquakes. Insurers writing personal lines property and casualty policies may be unable to increase
prices until some time after the costs associated with coverage have increased, primarily because of
state insurance rate regulation. The pace at which an insurer can change rates in response to increased
costs depends, in part, on whether the applicable state law requires prior approval of rate increases or
notification to the regulator either before or after a rate change is imposed. In states with prior
approval laws, rates must be approved by the regulator before being used by the insurer. In states
having ‘‘file-and-use’’ laws, the insurer must file rate changes with the regulator, but does not need to
wait for approval before using the new rates. A ‘‘use-and-file’’ law requires an insurer to file rates
within a period of time after the insurer begins using the new rate. Approximately one-half of the
states require prior approval of most rate changes. In addition, changes to methods of marketing and
underwriting in some jurisdictions are subject to state-imposed restrictions, which can make it more
difficult for an insurer to significantly manage catastrophe exposures.

17

The Company’s ability or willingness to raise prices, modify underwriting terms or reduce exposure

to certain geographies may be limited due to considerations of public policy, the competitive
environment, the evolving political environment and/or changes in the general economic climate. The
Company also may choose to write business it might not otherwise write in some states for strategic
purposes, such as improving access to other commercial or personal underwriting opportunities. In
choosing to write business in some states, the Company also considers the costs and benefits of those
states’ residual markets and guaranty funds, as well as other property and casualty business the
Company writes in those states.

International

Pricing and underwriting for personal automobile and homeowners insurance in Canada is driven

in large part by the same factors as in the United States. For personal automobile insurance, all
provinces in Canada require prior approval before rates are implemented.

Product Lines

Domestic

The primary coverages in Personal Insurance are personal automobile and homeowners and other

insurance sold to individuals. Personal Insurance had approximately 7.2 million active policies
(e.g., policies-in-force) in the United States at December 31, 2017.

Personal Insurance writes the following types of coverages:
(cid:127) Personal Automobile provides coverage for liability to others for both bodily injury and property

damage, uninsured motorist protection, and for physical damage to an insured’s own vehicle
from collision, fire, flood, hail and theft. In addition, many states require policies to provide
first-party personal injury protection, frequently referred to as no-fault coverage.

(cid:127) Homeowners and Other provides protection against losses to residences and contents from a
variety of perils (excluding flooding) as well as coverage for personal liability. The Company
writes homeowners insurance for dwellings, condominiums and tenants, and rental properties.
The Company also writes coverage for boats and yachts and valuable personal items such as
jewelry, and also writes coverages for umbrella liability, identity fraud, and weddings and special
events.

International

(cid:127) International provides automobile and homeowners and other coverages in Canada (similar to

coverages in the United States). Personal Insurance had approximately 562,000 active policies in
Canada at December 31, 2017.

Net Retention Policy Per Risk

The following discussion reflects the Company’s retention policy with respect to Personal Insurance
as of January 1, 2018. Personal Insurance generally retains its primary personal auto exposures in their
entirety. For personal property insurance, there is an $8.0 million maximum retention per risk, net of
reinsurance. Personal Insurance uses facultative reinsurance to provide additional limits capacity or to
reduce retentions on an individual risk basis. Personal Insurance issues umbrella policies up to a
maximum limit of $10.0 million per risk. Personal Insurance may also retain amounts greater than
those described herein based upon the individual characteristics of the risk.

Competition

Domestic

Although national companies (including international companies doing business in the U.S.) write

the majority of this business, Personal Insurance also faces competition from many regional and
hundreds of local companies. Personal Insurance primarily competes based on breadth of product
offerings, price, service (including claims handling), ease and speed of doing business, stability of the
insurer and name recognition. Personal Insurance competes for business within each independent
agency since these agencies also offer policies of competing companies. At the agency level,
competition is primarily based on price, service (including claims handling), the level of automation and
the development of long-term relationships with individual agents. In recent years, most independent
personal insurance agents have begun utilizing price comparison rating technology, sometimes referred
to as ‘‘comparative raters,’’ as a cost-efficient means of obtaining quotes from multiple companies.
Because the use of this technology facilitates the process of generating multiple quotes, the technology
has increased price comparison on new business and, increasingly, on renewal business. Personal
Insurance also competes with insurance companies that use exclusive agents or salaried employees to
sell their products, as well as those that employ direct marketing strategies.

19

International

Personal Insurance competes with numerous international and domestic insurers in Canada.

Companies compete on the basis of price, breadth of product offerings and the level of claim and risk
management services provided. The Company has developed expertise in various markets in Canada
similar to those served in the United States and provides both automobile and homeowners and other
coverages for this market.

See ‘‘Item 1A—Risk Factors—The intense competition that we face, and the impact of innovation,
technological change and changing customer preferences on the insurance industry and the markets in
which we operate, could harm our ability to maintain or increase our business volumes and our
profitability.’’

CLAIMS MANAGEMENT

The Company’s claim functions are managed through its Claims Services organization, with
locations in the United States and in the other countries where it does business. With more than
11,000 employees, Claims Services employs a group of professionals with diverse skills, including claim
adjusters, appraisers, attorneys, investigators, engineers, accountants, nurses, data and analytics
professionals, system specialists and training, management and support personnel. Approved external
service providers, such as investigators, attorneys and, when necessary, independent adjusters and
appraisers, are available for use as appropriate.

United States field claim management teams located in 20 claim centers and 53 satellite and

specialty-only offices in 44 states are organized to maintain focus on the specific claim characteristics
unique to the businesses within the Company’s business segments. Claim teams with specialized skills,
required licenses, resources and workflows are matched to the unique exposures of those businesses,
with local claims management dedicated to achieving optimal results within each segment. The
Company’s home office operations provide additional support in the form of workflow design, quality
management, information technology, advanced management information and data analysis, training,
financial reporting and control, and human resources strategy. This structure permits the Company to
maintain the economies of scale of a large, established company while retaining the agility to respond
promptly to the needs of customers, brokers, agents and underwriters. Claims management for
International, while generally provided locally by staff in the respective international locations due to
local knowledge of applicable laws and regulations, is also managed by the Company’s Claims Services
organization in the United States to leverage that knowledge base and to share best practices.

An integral part of the Company’s strategy to benefit customers and shareholders is its continuing

industry leadership in the fight against insurance fraud through its Investigative Services unit. The
Company has a nationwide staff of experts who investigate a wide array of insurance fraud schemes
using in-house forensic resources and other technological tools. This staff also has specialized expertise
in fire scene examinations, medical provider fraud schemes and data mining. The Company also
dedicates investigative resources to ensure that violations of law are reported to and prosecuted by law
enforcement agencies.

Claims Services uses technology, management information and data analysis to assist the Company

in reviewing its claim practices and results in order to evaluate and improve its claims management
performance. The Company’s claims-management strategy is focused on segmentation of claims and
appropriate technical specialization to drive effective claim resolution. The Company continually
monitors its investment in claim resources to maintain an effective focus on claim outcomes and a
disciplined approach to continual improvement. The Company operates a state-of-the-art claims-
training facility which offers hands-on experiential learning to help ensure that its claim professionals
are properly trained. In recent years, the Company has invested significant additional resources in many
of its claim-handling operations, including the utilization of drone technology, and routinely monitors
the effect of those investments to ensure a consistent optimization among outcomes, cost and service.

20

Claims Services’ catastrophe response strategy is to respond to a significant catastrophic event

using its own personnel, enabling it to minimize reliance on independent adjusters and appraisers. The
Company has developed a large dedicated catastrophe response team and trained a large Enterprise
Response Team of existing employees who can be deployed on short notice in the event of a
catastrophe that generates claim volume exceeding the capacity of the dedicated catastrophe response
team. In recent years, these internal resources were successfully deployed to respond to a record
number of catastrophe claims.

REINSURANCE

The Company reinsures a portion of the risks it underwrites in order to manage its exposure to
losses and to protect its capital. The Company cedes to reinsurers a portion of these risks and pays
premiums based upon the risk and exposure of the policies subject to such reinsurance. The Company
utilizes a variety of reinsurance agreements to manage its exposure to large property and casualty
losses, including catastrophe, treaty, facultative and quota share reinsurance. Ceded reinsurance
involves credit risk, except with regard to mandatory pools and associations, and is predominantly
subject to aggregate loss limits. Although the reinsurer is liable to the Company to the extent of the
reinsurance ceded, the Company remains liable as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured. Reinsurance
recoverables are reported after reductions for known insolvencies and after allowances for uncollectible
amounts. The Company also holds collateral, including trust agreements, escrow funds and letters of
credit, under certain reinsurance agreements. The Company monitors the financial condition of
reinsurers on an ongoing basis and reviews its reinsurance arrangements periodically. Reinsurers are
selected based on their financial condition, business practices, the price of their product offerings and
the value of collateral provided. After reinsurance is purchased, the Company has limited ability to
manage the credit risk to a reinsurer. In addition, in a number of jurisdictions, particularly the
European Union and the United Kingdom, a reinsurer is permitted to transfer a reinsurance
arrangement to another reinsurer, which may be less creditworthy, without a counterparty’s consent,
provided that the transfer has been approved by the applicable regulatory and/or court authority.

For additional information regarding reinsurance, see note 5 of notes to the consolidated financial

statements and ‘‘Item 1A—Risk Factors.’’ For a description of reinsurance-related litigation, see
note 16 of notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Catastrophe Reinsurance

Catastrophes can be caused by a variety of events, including, among others, hurricanes, tornadoes

and other windstorms, earthquakes, hail, wildfires, severe winter weather, floods, tsunamis, volcanic
eruptions and other naturally-occurring events, such as solar flares. Catastrophes can also result from
terrorist attacks and other intentionally destructive acts including those involving nuclear, biological,
chemical and radiological events, cyber events, explosions and destruction of infrastructure. The
incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable. The extent of losses from a
catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure affected by the event and the
severity of the event. Most catastrophes are restricted to small geographic areas; however, hurricanes
and earthquakes may produce significant damage in larger areas, especially those areas that are heavily
populated. The Company generally seeks to manage its exposure to catastrophes through individual risk
selection and the purchase of catastrophe reinsurance. In addition to the Company’s catastrophe
reinsurance coverages, the Company is also party to other reinsurance treaties that can provide
additional coverage for losses arising from catastrophes, as described in the ‘‘Net Retention Policy Per
Risk’’ sections of the respective segment discussions above. The Company conducts an ongoing review
of its risk and catastrophe coverages and from time to time makes changes as it deems appropriate.
The following discussion summarizes the Company’s catastrophe reinsurance coverage at January 1,
2018.

21

Corporate Catastrophe Excess-of-Loss Reinsurance Treaty. This treaty covers the accumulation of

certain property losses arising from one or multiple occurrences for the period January 1, 2018 through
and including December 31, 2018. The treaty provides for recovery of 75% of the dollar amount of
each qualifying loss in excess of a $3.0 billion retention, up to a maximum amount of qualifying losses
of $2.0 billion. Therefore, the maximum recovery under the treaty would be $1.5 billion.  Qualifying
losses for each occurrence are after a $100 million deductible. The treaty covers all of the Company’s
exposures in the United States and Canada and their territories and possessions, the Caribbean Islands,
Mexico and all waters contiguous thereto. The treaty only provides coverage for terrorism events in
limited circumstances and excludes entirely losses arising from nuclear, biological, chemical or
radiological attacks.

Catastrophe Bonds. The Company has catastrophe protection through an indemnity reinsurance
agreement with Long Point Re III Ltd. (Long Point Re III), an independent Cayman Islands company
licensed as a Class C insurer in the Cayman Islands. The reinsurance agreement expires in May 2018
and meets the requirements to be accounted for as reinsurance in accordance with the guidance for
reinsurance contracts. In connection with the reinsurance agreement, Long Point Re III issued notes
(generally referred to as ‘‘catastrophe bonds’’) to investors in amounts equal to the full coverage
provided under the reinsurance agreement as described below. The proceeds were deposited in a
reinsurance trust account. The businesses covered by this reinsurance agreement are subsets of the
Company’s overall insurance portfolio, comprising specified property coverages spread across the
following geographic locations: Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Maine, Maryland,
Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia and
Vermont.

The reinsurance agreement with Long Point Re III provides coverage of up to $300 million to the
Company for losses from tropical cyclones, earthquakes, severe thunderstorms or winter storms in the
locations listed above. The attachment point and maximum limit under this agreement are reset
annually to adjust the expected loss of the layer within a predetermined range. Until and including
May 15, 2018, the Company is entitled to begin recovering amounts under this reinsurance agreement if
the covered losses in the covered area for a single occurrence reach an initial attachment amount of
$2.346 billion. The full $300 million coverage amount is available on a proportional basis until such
covered losses reach a maximum $2.846 billion. The coverage under the reinsurance agreement is
limited to specified property coverage written in Personal Insurance; Select Accounts, Middle Market
(excluding Excess Casualty and Boiler & Machinery) and National Property and Other in Business
Insurance; and Bond & Specialty Insurance Other in Bond & Specialty Insurance.

Under the terms of the reinsurance agreement, the Company is obligated to pay annual

reinsurance premiums to Long Point Re III for the reinsurance coverage. Amounts payable to the
Company under the reinsurance agreement with respect to any covered event cannot exceed the
Company’s actual losses from such event. The principal amount of the catastrophe bonds will be
reduced by any amounts paid to the Company under the reinsurance agreement.

As with any reinsurance agreement, there is credit risk associated with collecting amounts due

from reinsurers. With regard to Long Point Re III, the credit risk is mitigated by a reinsurance trust
account that has been funded by Long Point Re III with money market funds that invest solely in
direct government obligations and obligations backed by the U.S. government with maturities of no
more than 13 months. The money market funds must have a principal stability rating of at least AAAm
by Standard & Poor’s on the issuance date of the bonds and thereafter must be rated by Standard &
Poor’s. Other permissible investments include money market funds which invest in repurchase and
reverse repurchase agreements collateralized by direct government obligations and obligations of any
agency backed by the U.S. government with terms of no more than 397 calendar days, and cash.

22

At the time the agreement was entered into with Long Point Re III, the Company evaluated the
applicability of the accounting guidance that addresses variable interest entities or VIEs. Under this
guidance, an entity that is formed for business purposes is considered a VIE if: (a) the equity investors
lack the direct or indirect ability through voting rights or similar rights to make decisions about an
entity’s activities that have a significant effect on the entity’s operations or (b) the equity investors do
not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities. Additionally, a company
that absorbs a majority of the expected losses from a VIE’s activities or is entitled to receive a majority
of the entity’s expected residual returns, or both, is considered to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE
and is required to consolidate the VIE in the company’s financial statements.

As a result of the evaluation of the reinsurance agreement with Long Point Re III, the Company
concluded that it was a VIE because the conditions described in items (a) and (b) above were present.
However, while Long Point Re III was determined to be a VIE, the Company concluded that it did not
have a variable interest in the entity, as the variability in its results, caused by the reinsurance
agreement, is expected to be absorbed entirely by the investors in the catastrophe bonds issued by Long
Point Re III and residual amounts earned by it, if any, are expected to be absorbed by the equity
investors (the Company has neither an equity nor a residual interest in Long Point Re III).

Accordingly, the Company is not the primary beneficiary of Long Point Re III and does not

consolidate that entity in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Additionally, because the
Company has no intention to pursue any transaction that would result in it acquiring interest in and
becoming the primary beneficiary of Long Point Re III, the consolidation of that entity in the
Company’s consolidated financial statements in future periods is unlikely.

The Company has not incurred any losses that have resulted or are expected to result in a recovery

under the Long Point Re III agreement since its inception.

Northeast Property Catastrophe Excess-of-Loss Reinsurance Treaty. This treaty provides up to

$800 million part of $850 million of all perils (coverage for terrorism events in limited circumstances
and excludes entirely losses from nuclear, biological and radiological attacks), subject to a $2.25 billion
retention, from Virginia to Maine for the period July 1, 2017 through and including June 30, 2018.
Losses from a covered event (occurring over several days) anywhere in the United States, Canada, the
Caribbean and Mexico and waters contiguous thereto may be used to satisfy the retention. Recoveries
under the catastrophe bonds (if any) would be first applied to reduce losses subject to this treaty.

Middle Market Earthquake Catastrophe Excess-of-Loss Reinsurance Treaty. This treaty provides for

up to $150 million part of $165 million of coverage, subject to an $80 million retention, for losses
arising from an earthquake, including fire following and sprinkler leakage incurred under policies
written by Technology, Public Sector Services and Commercial Accounts in Business Insurance for the
period July 1, 2017 through and including June 30, 2018.

Personal Insurance Earthquake Catastrophe Excess-of-Loss Reinsurance Treaty. This treaty provides

for up to $200 million of coverage, subject to a $150 million retention, for losses arising from an
earthquake, including fire following and sprinkler leakage incurred under policies written by Personal
Insurance for the period January 1, 2018 through and including December 31, 2018.

Canadian Property Catastrophe Excess-of-Loss Reinsurance Treaty. This treaty, effective for the

period July 1, 2017 through and including June 30, 2018, covers the accumulation of net property losses
arising out of one occurrence on business written by the Company’s Canadian businesses. The treaty
covers all property written by the Company’s Canadian businesses for Canadian insureds, including, but
not limited to, habitational property, commercial property, inland marine, ocean marine and auto
physical damages exposures, with respect to risks located worldwide, written for Canadian insureds. The
treaty provides coverage for 50% of losses in excess of C$100 million (US$80 million at December 31,
2017), up to C$200 million (US$160 million at December 31, 2017) and for 100% of losses in excess of

23

C$200 million (US$160 million at December 31, 2017), up to C$600 million (US$479 million at
December 31, 2017).

Other International Reinsurance Treaties. For other business underwritten in Canada, as well as for

business written in the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, Brazil and in the Company’s
operations at Lloyd’s, separate reinsurance protections are purchased locally that have lower net
retentions more commensurate with the size of the respective local balance sheet.

Terrorism Risk Insurance Program. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program is a Federal program
administered by the Department of the Treasury authorized through December 31, 2020 that provides
for a system of shared public and private compensation for certain insured losses resulting from
certified acts of terrorism. For a further description of the program, including the Company’s estimated
deductible under the program in 2018, see note 5 of notes to the consolidated financial statements and
‘‘Item 1A—Risk Factors—Catastrophe losses could materially and adversely affect our results of
operations, our financial position and/or liquidity, and could adversely impact our ratings, our ability to
raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance.’’

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES

Claims and claim adjustment expense reserves represent management’s estimate of ultimate unpaid

costs of losses and loss adjustment expenses for claims that have been reported and claims that have
been incurred but not yet reported.

The Company continually refines its reserve estimates as part of a regular ongoing process that

includes reviews of key assumptions, underlying variables and historical loss experience. The Company
reflects adjustments to reserves in the results of operations in the periods in which the estimates are
changed. In establishing reserves, the Company takes into account estimated recoveries for reinsurance,
salvage and subrogation. The reserves are reviewed regularly by qualified actuaries employed by the
Company. For additional information on the process of estimating reserves and a discussion of
underlying variables and risk factors, see ‘‘Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Estimates.’’

The process of estimating loss reserves involves a high degree of judgment and is subject to a

number of variables. These variables (discussed by product line in the ‘‘Critical Accounting Estimates’’
section of ‘‘Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations’’) are affected by both internal and external events, such as changes in claims handling
procedures, inflation, judicial trends and the legislative landscape, among others. The impact of many
of these items on ultimate costs for claims and claim adjustment expenses is difficult to estimate.
Reserve estimation difficulties also differ significantly by product line due to differences in the
underlying insurance contract (e.g., claims-made versus occurrence), claim complexity, the volume of
claims, the potential severity of individual claims, the determination of the occurrence date for a claim,
and reporting lags (the time between the occurrence of the insured event and when it is actually
reported to the insurer). Informed judgment is applied throughout the process.

The Company derives estimates for unreported claims and development with respect to reported

claims principally from actuarial analyses of historical patterns of loss development by accident year for
each business unit, product line and type of exposure. Similarly, the Company derives estimates of
unpaid loss adjustment expenses principally from actuarial analyses of historical development patterns
and the relationship of loss adjustment expenses to losses for each product line and type of exposure.

‘‘Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—
Asbestos Claims and Litigation,’’ and ‘‘—Environmental Claims and Litigation.’’

Certain of the Company’s claims and claim adjustment expense reserves are discounted to present

value. See note 7 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

Reserves on Statutory Accounting Basis

At December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, claims and claim adjustment expense reserves (net of

reinsurance) prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP
reserves) were $56 million higher, $44 million higher and $41 million higher, respectively, than those
reported in the Company’s respective annual reports filed with insurance regulators, which are
prepared in accordance with statutory accounting practices (statutory reserves).

The differences between GAAP and statutory reserves are primarily due to the differences in

GAAP and statutory accounting for two items: (1) fees associated with billing of required
reimbursements under large deductible business and (2) the accounting for retroactive reinsurance. For
large deductible business, the Company pays the deductible portion of a casualty insurance claim and
then seeks reimbursement from the insured, plus a fee. This fee is reported as fee income for GAAP
reporting, but as an offset to claim expenses paid for statutory reporting. Retroactive reinsurance
balances result from reinsurance placed to cover losses on insured events occurring prior to the
inception of a reinsurance contract. For GAAP reporting, retroactive reinsurance balances are included
in reinsurance recoverables and result in lower net reserve amounts. Statutory accounting practices
require retroactive reinsurance balances to be recorded in other liabilities as contra-liabilities rather
than in loss reserves.

Asbestos and Environmental Claims

Asbestos and environmental claims are segregated from other claims and are handled separately by

the Company’s Special Liability Group, a separate unit staffed by dedicated legal, claim, finance and
engineering professionals. For additional information on asbestos and environmental claims, see
‘‘Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—
Asbestos Claims and Litigation’’ and ‘‘—Environmental Claims and Litigation.’’

INTERCOMPANY REINSURANCE POOLING ARRANGEMENTS

Most of the Company’s domestic insurance subsidiaries are members of an intercompany property

and casualty reinsurance pooling arrangement. Pooling arrangements permit the participating
companies to rely on the capacity of the entire pool’s statutory capital and surplus rather than just on
its own statutory capital and surplus. Under such arrangements, the members share substantially all
insurance business that is written and allocate the combined premiums, losses and expenses.

RATINGS

Ratings are an important factor in assessing the Company’s competitive position in the insurance
industry. The Company receives ratings from the following major rating agencies: A.M. Best Company
(A.M. Best), Fitch Ratings (Fitch), Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s) and Standard & Poor’s Corp.
(S&P). Rating agencies typically issue two types of ratings for insurance companies: claims-paying (or
financial strength) ratings, which reflect the rating agency’s assessment of an insurer’s ability to meet its
financial obligations to policyholders, and debt ratings, which reflect the rating agency’s assessment of a
company’s prospects for repaying its debts and are considered by lenders in connection with the setting
of interest rates and terms for a company’s short- and long-term borrowings. Agency ratings are not a
recommendation to buy, sell or hold any security, and they may be revised or withdrawn at any time by
the rating agency. Each agency’s rating should be evaluated independently of any other agency’s rating.
The system and the number of rating categories can vary widely from rating agency to rating agency.
Customers usually focus on claims-paying ratings, while creditors focus on debt ratings. Investors use

25

both to evaluate a company’s overall financial strength. The ratings issued on the Company or its
subsidiaries by any of these agencies are announced publicly and are available on the Company’s
website and from the agencies.

A downgrade in one or more of the Company’s claims-paying ratings could negatively impact the
Company’s business volumes and competitive position because demand for certain of its products may
be reduced, particularly because some customers require that the Company maintain minimum ratings
to enter into, maintain or renew business with it.

Additionally, a downgrade in one or more of the Company’s debt ratings could adversely impact

the Company’s ability to access the capital markets and other sources of funds, including in the
syndicated bank loan market, and/or result in higher financing costs. For example, downgrades in the
Company’s debt ratings could result in higher interest expense under the Company’s revolving credit
agreement (under which the cost of borrowing could range from LIBOR plus 87.5 basis points to
LIBOR plus 150 basis points, depending on the Company’s debt ratings), the Company’s commercial
paper program, or in the event that the Company were to access the capital markets by issuing debt or
similar types of securities. See note 8 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion
of the Company’s revolving credit agreement and commercial paper program. The Company considers
the level of increased cash funding requirements in the event of a ratings downgrade as part of the
evaluation of the Company’s liquidity requirements. The Company currently believes that a one- to
two-notch downgrade in its debt ratings would not result in a material increase in interest expense
under its existing credit agreement and commercial paper programs. In addition, the Company
considers the impact of a ratings downgrade as part of the evaluation of its common share repurchases.

(cid:127) On June 19, 2017, Fitch affirmed all ratings of the Company. The outlook for all ratings is

stable.

Insurance Company Limited, which were affirmed on January 12, 2018. The outlook for all
ratings is stable. Concurrently with the affirmation of these ratings, A.M. Best withdrew its
ratings for The Premier Insurance Company of Massachusetts at the Company’s request.

INVESTMENT OPERATIONS

The majority of funds available for investment are deployed in a widely diversified portfolio of

high quality, liquid, taxable U.S. government, tax-exempt U.S. municipal and taxable corporate and U.S.
agency mortgage-backed bonds. The Company closely monitors the duration of its fixed maturity
investments, and the Company’s investment purchases and sales are executed with the objective of
having adequate funds available to satisfy its insurance and debt obligations. Generally, the expected
principal and interest payments produced by the Company’s fixed maturity portfolio adequately fund
the estimated runoff of the Company’s insurance reserves. The Company’s management of the duration
of the fixed maturity investment portfolio, including its use of Treasury futures at times, has produced a
duration that is less than the estimated duration of the Company’s net insurance liabilities. The
substantial amount by which the fair value of the fixed maturity portfolio exceeds the value of the net
insurance liabilities, as well as the positive cash flow from newly sold policies and the large amount of
high-quality liquid bonds, contributes to the Company’s ability to fund claim payments without having
to sell illiquid assets or access credit facilities.

27

The Company also invests much smaller amounts in equity securities, real estate, private equity
limited partnerships, hedge funds, and real estate partnerships and joint ventures. These investment
classes have the potential for higher returns but also involve varying degrees of risk, including less
stable rates of return and less liquidity.

See note 3 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding

the Company’s investment portfolio.

REGULATION

U.S. State and Federal Regulation

TRV’s domestic insurance subsidiaries are collectively licensed to transact insurance business in all
U.S. states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands and are subject to
regulation in the various states and jurisdictions in which they transact business. The extent of
regulation varies, but generally derives from statutes that delegate regulatory, supervisory and
administrative authority to a department of insurance in each state and jurisdiction. The regulation,
supervision and administration relate, among other things, to standards of solvency that must be met
and maintained, the licensing of insurers and their agents, the nature of and limitations on investments,
premium rates, restrictions on the size of risks that may be insured under a single policy, reserves and
provisions for unearned premiums, losses and other obligations, deposits of securities for the benefit of
policyholders, approval of policy forms and the regulation of market conduct, including the use of
credit information in underwriting as well as other underwriting and claims practices. State insurance
departments also conduct periodic examinations of the financial condition and market conduct of
insurance companies and require the filing of financial and other reports on a quarterly and annual
basis.

State insurance regulation continues to evolve in response to the changing economic and business

environment as well as efforts by regulators internationally to develop a consistent approach to
regulation. While the U.S. federal government has not historically regulated the insurance business, the
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 established a Federal Insurance
Office (FIO) within the U.S. Department of the Treasury. While the FIO has limited regulatory
authority, it has been active in the discussions to develop international regulatory standards for the
insurance industry. In response to these international efforts, the state insurance regulators, through the
National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), are working with the Federal Reserve and
the FIO to consider and develop changes to the U.S. regulatory framework.

These changes are evidenced by the incorporation of supervisory colleges into the U.S. regulatory

framework. A supervisory college is a forum of the regulators having jurisdictional authority over a
holding company’s various insurance subsidiaries, including foreign insurance subsidiaries, convened to
meet with the insurer’s executive management, to evaluate the insurer from both a group-wide and
legal-entity basis. Some of the items evaluated during the colleges include the insurer’s business
strategies, enterprise risk management and corporate governance.

While insurance in the United States is regulated on a legal-entity basis, the NAIC has adopted

changes to its Model Holding Company Act that some states, including the State of Connecticut, have
enacted to allow the insurance commissioner to be designated as the group-wide supervisor (i.e., lead
regulator) for the insurance holding company system based upon certain criteria, including the place of
domicile of the insurance subsidiaries holding the majority of the insurance group’s premiums, assets,
or liabilities. Based upon these criteria, the State of Connecticut Insurance Department is designated as
TRV’s lead regulator and conducts the supervisory colleges for the Company.

Insurance Regulation Concerning Dividends from Insurance Subsidiaries. TRV’s principal domestic

insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in the State of Connecticut. The Connecticut insurance holding

28

company laws require notice to, and approval by, the state insurance commissioner for the declaration
or payment of any dividend from an insurance subsidiary that, together with other distributions made
within the preceding twelve months, exceeds the greater of 10% of the insurance subsidiary’s statutory
capital and surplus as of the preceding December 31, or the insurance subsidiary’s net income for the
twelve-month period ending the preceding December 31, in each case determined in accordance with
statutory accounting practices and by state regulation. This declaration or payment is further limited by
adjusted unassigned surplus, as determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices.
The insurance holding company laws of other states in which TRV’s domestic insurance

subsidiaries are domiciled generally contain similar, although in some instances somewhat more
restrictive, limitations on the payment of dividends.

Rate and Rule Approvals. TRV’s domestic insurance subsidiaries are subject to each state’s laws

and regulations regarding rate and rule approvals. The applicable laws and regulations generally
establish standards to ensure that rates are not excessive, inadequate, unfairly discriminatory or used to
engage in unfair price competition. An insurer’s ability to adjust rates and the relative timing of the
process are dependent upon each state’s requirements. Many states have enacted variations of
competitive ratemaking laws, which allow insurers to set certain premium rates for certain classes of
insurance without having to obtain the prior approval of the state insurance department.

Requirements for Exiting Geographic Markets and/or Canceling or Nonrenewing Policies. Many states

have laws and regulations which may impact the timing and/or the ability of an insurer to either
discontinue or substantially reduce its writings in that state. These laws and regulations typically require
prior notice, and in some instances insurance department approval, prior to discontinuing a line of
business or withdrawing from that state. In addition, all states impose limitations on cancellations or
non-renewals of certain policies, including in particular, limitations on the reasons for cancellations and
on the timing of non-renewals.

Assessments for Guaranty Funds and Second-Injury Funds and Other Mandatory Assigned Risk and
Reinsurance Arrangements. Virtually all states require insurers licensed to do business in their state,
including TRV’s domestic insurance subsidiaries, to bear a portion of the loss suffered by some
claimants because of the insolvency of other insurers. Many states also have laws that establish second-
injury funds to provide compensation to injured employees for aggravation of a prior condition or
injury.

TRV’s domestic insurance subsidiaries are also required to participate in various involuntary
assigned risk pools, principally involving workers’ compensation, automobile insurance, property
windpools in states prone to property damage from hurricanes and Fair Access to Insurance
Requirements (FAIR) plans, as well as automobile assigned risk plans the results of which are not
pooled with other carriers, which provide various insurance coverages to individuals or other entities
that otherwise are unable to purchase that coverage in the voluntary market.

Assessments may include any charge mandated by statute or regulatory authority that is related

directly or indirectly to underwriting activities. Examples of such mechanisms include, but are not
limited to, the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund, Florida Citizens Property Insurance Corporation,
National Workers’ Compensation Reinsurance Pool, various workers’ compensation related funds
(e.g., the Florida Special Disability Trust), North Carolina Beach Plan, Louisiana Citizens Property
Insurance Corporation, and the Texas Windstorm Insurance Association. Amounts payable or paid as a
result of arrangements that are in substance reinsurance, including certain involuntary pools where
insurers are required to assume premiums and losses from those pools, are accounted for as
reinsurance (e.g., National Workers’ Compensation Reinsurance Pool, North Carolina Beach Plan).
Amounts related to assessments from arrangements that are not reinsurance are reported as a
component of ‘‘General and Administrative Expenses,’’ such as the Florida Special Disability Trust. For

29

additional information concerning assessments for guaranty funds and second-injury funds and other
mandatory assigned risk and reinsurance agreements including state-funding mechanisms, see
‘‘Item 1A—Risk Factors.’’

Insurance Regulatory Information System. The NAIC developed the Insurance Regulatory

Information System (IRIS) to help state regulators identify companies that may require regulatory
attention. Financial examiners review annual financial statements and the results of key financial ratios
based on year-end data with the goal of identifying insurers that appear to require immediate
regulatory attention. Each ratio has an established ‘‘usual range’’ of results. A ratio result falling
outside the usual range, however, is not necessarily considered adverse; rather, unusual values are used
as part of the regulatory early monitoring system. Furthermore, in some years, it may not be unusual
for financially sound companies to have several ratios with results outside the usual ranges. Generally,
an insurance company may become subject to regulatory scrutiny or, depending on the company’s
financial condition, regulatory action if certain of its key IRIS ratios fall outside the usual ranges and
the insurer’s financial condition is trending downward.

Based on preliminary 2017 IRIS ratios calculated by the Company for its lead domestic insurance

subsidiaries, The Travelers Indemnity Company had results outside the normal range for one IRIS ratio
due to the size of its investments in certain non-fixed maturity securities, while Travelers Casualty and
Surety Company had results outside the normal range for one IRIS ratio due to the amount of
dividends received from its subsidiaries. In 2016, The Travelers Indemnity Company and Travelers
Casualty and Surety Company had results outside the normal range for these same ratios. Additionally,
St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Company had results outside the normal range for one IRIS ratio
in 2016 due to the amount of dividends received from its subsidiaries.

Management does not anticipate regulatory action as a result of the 2017 IRIS ratio results for the

lead insurance subsidiaries or their insurance subsidiaries. In all instances in prior years, regulators
have been satisfied upon follow-up that no regulatory action was required.

Risk-Based Capital (RBC) Requirements. The NAIC has an RBC requirement which sets forth

minimum capital standards for most property and casualty insurance companies and is intended to raise
the level of protection for policyholder obligations. The Company’s U.S. insurance subsidiaries are
subject to these NAIC RBC requirements based on laws that have been adopted by individual states.
These requirements subject insurers having policyholders’ surplus less than that required by the RBC
calculation to varying degrees of regulatory action, depending on the level of capital inadequacy. Each
of the Company’s U.S. insurance subsidiaries had policyholders’ surplus at December 31, 2017
significantly above the level at which any RBC regulatory action would occur.

While there is currently no group regulatory capital requirement in the United States, a

comparison of an insurer’s policyholders’ surplus on a combined basis to the legal entity NAIC RBC
requirements on a combined basis can provide useful information regarding an insurance group’s
overall capital adequacy in the U.S. The amount of policyholders’ surplus held by the Company’s U.S.
insurance subsidiaries at December 31, 2017, determined on a combined basis, significantly exceeded
the level at which the subsidiaries would be subject to RBC regulatory action (company action level) on
a combined basis at that date.

The formulas have not been designed to differentiate among adequately capitalized companies that
operate with levels of capital above the RBC requirement. Therefore, it is inappropriate and ineffective
to use the formulas to rate or to rank these companies.

Investment Regulation.

Insurance company investments must comply with applicable laws and

regulations which prescribe the kind, quality and concentration of investments. In general, these laws
and regulations permit investments in federal, state and municipal obligations, corporate bonds,
preferred and common equity securities, mortgage loans, real estate and certain other investments,

30

subject to specified limits and certain other qualifications. At December 31, 2017, the Company was in
compliance with these laws and regulations.

International Regulation

TRV’s insurance subsidiaries based in Canada, and the Canadian branch of one of the Company’s
U.S. insurance subsidiaries, are regulated for solvency purposes by the Office of the Superintendent of
Financial Institutions (OSFI) under the provisions of the Insurance Companies Act (Canada). These
Canadian subsidiaries and the Canadian branch are also subject to Canadian provincial and territorial
insurance legislation which regulates market conduct, including pricing, underwriting, coverage and
claim conduct, in varying degrees by province/territory and by product line.

TRV’s insurance subsidiaries based in the United Kingdom are regulated by two regulatory bodies,

The Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The PRA’s
primary objective is to promote the safety and soundness of insurers for the protection of policyholders,
while the FCA has three operational objectives: (i) to secure an appropriate degree of protection for
consumers, (ii) to protect and enhance the integrity of the U.K. financial system, and (iii) to promote
effective competition in the interests of consumers. TRV’s insurance operations in the Republic of
Ireland are conducted through the Irish branch of Travelers Insurance Company Limited which is
supervised by the Insurance Supervision Departments of the Central Bank of Ireland (as to conduct)
and also by the PRA.

TRV’s managing agency (Travelers Syndicate Management Limited) (TSML) of its Lloyd’s

syndicate (Syndicate 5000) is also regulated by the PRA and the FCA, which have delegated certain
regulatory responsibilities to the Council of Lloyd’s. Travelers Syndicate 5000 is able to write business
in over 75 jurisdictions throughout the world by virtue of Lloyd’s international licenses. In each such
jurisdiction, the policies written by TSML, as part of Lloyd’s, are subject to the laws and insurance
regulations of that jurisdiction. Travelers Underwriting Agency Limited, which as an insurance
intermediary is regulated by the FCA, produces insurance business for Travelers Syndicate 5000.

TRV’s operations in the U.K. and the Republic of Ireland are also subject to regulation by the

European Union (EU). Generally, EU requirements are adopted by the EU and then implemented by
enabling legislation in the member countries. Significant areas of oversight and influence from the EU
include capital and solvency requirements (Solvency II), competition law and antitrust regulation,
intermediary and distribution regulation, gender discrimination and data security and privacy. The
applicability to TRV’s businesses of all of the EU requirements are likely to change in ways yet to be
determined as a result of the U.K.’s exit from the EU, which is currently expected to be effective in
March 2019. The Company announced in December 2017 that it applied to the Central Bank of
Ireland for authorization of a new wholly owned insurance subsidiary to be incorporated in the
Republic of Ireland to serve its customers and broking partners in Ireland and across Europe upon the
U.K.’s exit from the EU.

A TRV subsidiary, Travelers Casualty and Surety Company, has a representative office in China.

The representative office is regulated by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission. A TRV
subsidiary, TCI Global Services, Inc., has a liaison office in India. Insurance business in India is
regulated by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority. TRV’s Brazilian operations are
regulated by the Superintendencia de Seguros Privados (SUSEP).

Regulators in these jurisdictions require insurance companies to maintain certain levels of capital

depending on, among other things, the type and amount of insurance policies in force. Each of the
Company’s foreign insurance subsidiaries had capital above their respective regulatory requirements at
December 31, 2017.

31

United States and European Union Covered Agreement

On September 22, 2017, the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) and the Office of the
U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) signed a covered agreement (the Covered Agreement) regarding
prudential (solvency) insurance and reinsurance measures with the EU. The Covered Agreement
includes three areas of prudential insurance supervision related to: reinsurance contracts, group
supervision, and the exchange of information between U.S. and EU insurers and the respective
insurance regulators. The EU is expected to finalize approval of the Covered Agreement in the first
half of 2018.

The Covered Agreement is intended to promote cooperation between the U.S. and EU insurance

regulators, and limits the ability of the EU to apply solvency and group capital requirements to the
worldwide operations of any U.S. insurer operating in the EU. The Covered Agreement eliminates the
collateral and local presence requirements for EU reinsurers operating in the U.S. insurance market,
and for U.S. reinsurers operating in the EU, as a condition for credit for reinsurance in regulatory
reporting and capital requirements. The prospective elimination of the collateral requirement is
conditioned on the reinsurer meeting capital and solvency standards and maintaining a record of
prompt payments to ceding insurers. The Covered Agreement includes a five-year transition period to
full compliance.

Insurance Holding Company Statutes

As a holding company, TRV is not regulated as an insurance company. However, since TRV owns
capital stock in insurance subsidiaries, it is subject to state insurance holding company statutes, as well
as certain other laws, of each of its insurance subsidiaries’ states of domicile. All holding company
statutes, as well as other laws, require disclosure and, in some instances, prior approval of material
transactions between an insurance company and an affiliate. The holding company statutes and other
laws also require, among other things, prior approval of an acquisition of control of a domestic insurer,
some transactions between affiliates and the payment of extraordinary dividends or distributions.

Insurance Regulations Concerning Change of Control. Many state insurance regulatory laws contain

provisions that require advance approval by state agencies of any change in control of an insurance
company that is domiciled, or, in some cases, having substantial business that it is deemed to be
commercially domiciled, in that state.

The laws of many states also contain provisions requiring pre-notification to state agencies prior to
any change in control of a non-domestic insurance company admitted to transact business in that state.
While these pre-notification statutes do not authorize the state agency to disapprove the change of
control, they do authorize issuance of cease-and-desist orders with respect to the non-domestic insurer
if it is determined that some conditions, such as undue market concentration, would result from the
acquisition.

Any transactions that would constitute a change in control of any of TRV’s insurance subsidiaries

would generally require prior approval by the insurance departments of the states in which the
insurance subsidiaries are domiciled or commercially domiciled. They may also require pre-acquisition
notification in those states that have adopted pre-acquisition notification provisions and in which such
insurance subsidiaries are admitted to transact business.

Two of TRV’s insurance subsidiaries and its operations at Lloyd’s are domiciled in the United
Kingdom. Insurers in the United Kingdom are subject to change of control restrictions, including
approval of the PRA and FCA. TRV’s insurance subsidiaries domiciled in, or authorized to conduct
insurance business in, Canada are also subject to regulatory change of control restrictions, including
approval of OSFI. TRV’s Brazilian operations are subject to regulatory change of control and other
share transfer restrictions, including approval of SUSEP.

32

These requirements may deter, delay or prevent transactions affecting the control of or the

ownership of common stock, including transactions that could be advantageous to TRV’s shareholders.

Regulatory Developments

For a discussion of domestic and international regulatory developments, see ‘‘Item 1A—Risk

Factors’’ including ‘‘Changes in federal regulation could impose significant burdens on us and otherwise
adversely impact our results’’ and ‘‘Regulatory changes outside of the United States, including in
Canada, the U.K. and the European Union, could adversely impact our results of operations and limit
our growth.’’

ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT

As a large property and casualty insurance enterprise, the Company is exposed to many risks.

These risks are a function of the environments within which the Company operates. Since certain risks
can be correlated with other risks, an event or a series of events can impact multiple areas of the
Company simultaneously and have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial
position and/or liquidity. These exposures require an entity-wide view of risk and an understanding of
the potential impact on all aspects of the Company’s operations. It also requires the Company to
manage its risk-taking to be within its risk appetite in a prudent and balanced effort to create and
preserve value for all of the Company’s stakeholders. This approach to Company-wide risk evaluation
and management is commonly called Enterprise Risk Management (ERM). ERM activities involve
both the identification and assessment of a broad range of risks and the execution of synchronized
strategies to effectively manage such risks. Effective ERM also includes the determination of the
Company’s risk capital needs, which takes into account regulatory requirements and credit rating
considerations, in addition to economic and other factors.

ERM at the Company is an integral part of its business operations. All corporate leaders and the
Board of Directors are engaged in ERM. ERM involves risk-based analytics, as well as reporting and
feedback throughout the enterprise in support of the Company’s long-term financial strategies and
objectives.

The Company uses various analyses and methods, including proprietary and third-party computer
modeling processes, to make underwriting and reinsurance decisions designed to manage its exposure
to catastrophic events. In addition to catastrophe modeling and analysis, the Company also models and
analyzes its exposure to other extreme events. The Company also utilizes proprietary and third-party
computer modeling processes to evaluate capital adequacy. These analytical techniques are an integral
component of the Company’s ERM process and further support the Company’s long-term financial
strategies and objectives.

In addition to the day-to-day ERM activities within the Company’s operations, key internal risk

management functions include, among others, the Management and Operating Committees (comprised
of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and the other most senior members of management), the
Enterprise and Business Risk Committees of management, the Credit Committee, Chief Legal Officer,
General Counsel, the Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer, the Corporate Actuarial group, the
Corporate Audit group, the Corporate Controller group, the Accounting Policy group and the
Enterprise Underwriting group, among others. A senior executive team comprised of the Chief Risk
Officer and the Chief Underwriting Officer oversees the ERM process. The mission of this team is to
facilitate risk assessment and to collaborate in implementing effective risk management strategies
throughout the Company. Another strategic ERM objective of this team includes working across the
Company to enhance effective and realistic risk modeling capabilities as part of the Company’s overall
effort to understand and manage its portfolio of risks to be within its risk appetite. Board oversight of
ERM is provided by the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors, which reviews the strategies,

33

processes and controls pertaining to the Company’s insurance operations and oversees the
implementation, execution and performance of the Company’s ERM program. The Risk Committee of
the Board of Directors meets with senior management at least four times a year to discuss ERM
activities and provides a report to the full Board of Directors after each such meeting.

The Company’s ERM efforts build upon the foundation of an effective internal control

environment. ERM expands the internal control objectives of effective and efficient operations, reliable
financial reporting and compliance with applicable laws and regulations, to fostering, leading and
supporting an integrated, risk-based culture within the Company that focuses on value creation and
preservation. However, the Company can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that these
objectives will be met. Further, the design of any risk management or control system must reflect the
fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. As a
result, the possibility of material financial loss remains in spite of the Company’s significant ERM
efforts. An investor should carefully consider the risks and all of the other information set forth in this
annual report, including the discussions included in ‘‘Item 1A—Risk Factors,’’ ‘‘Item 7A—Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,’’ and ‘‘Item 8—Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data.’’

Assigned risk pools . . . . . . . . . . Reinsurance pools which cover risks for those unable to purchase

insurance in the voluntary market. Possible reasons for this inability
include the risk being too great or the profit being too small under
the required insurance rate structure. The costs of the risks
associated with these pools are charged back to insurance carriers
in proportion to their direct writings.

made on each specific individual reported claim.
Insurance which is primarily concerned with the losses caused by
injuries to third persons, i.e., not the insured, and the legal liability
imposed on the insured resulting therefrom. It includes, but is not
limited to, employers’ liability, workers’ compensation, public
liability, automobile liability, personal liability and aviation liability
insurance. It excludes certain types of losses that by law or custom
are considered as being exclusively within the scope of other types
of insurance, such as fire or marine.

Catastrophe . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . A severe loss designated a catastrophe by internationally recognized
organizations that track and report on insured losses resulting from
catastrophic events, such as Property Claim Services (PCS) for
events in the United States and Canada. Catastrophes can be
caused by various natural events, including, among others,
hurricanes, tornadoes and other windstorms, earthquakes, hail,
wildfires, severe winter weather, floods, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions
and other naturally-occurring events, such as solar flares.
Catastrophes can also be man-made, such as terrorist attacks and
other intentionally destructive acts including those involving nuclear,
biological, chemical and radiological events, cyber events, explosions
and destruction of infrastructure. Each catastrophe has unique
characteristics and catastrophes are not predictable as to timing or
amount. Their effects are included in net and core income and
claims and claim adjustment expense reserves upon occurrence. A
catastrophe may result in the payment of reinsurance reinstatement
premiums and assessments from various pools.

36

The Company’s threshold for disclosing catastrophes is primarily
determined at the reportable segment level. If a threshold for one
segment or a combination thereof is exceeded and the other
segments have losses from the same event, losses from the event
are identified as catastrophe losses in the segment results and for
the consolidated results of the Company. Additionally, an aggregate
threshold is applied for International business across all reportable
segments. The threshold for 2017 ranged from approximately
$17 million to $30 million of losses before reinsurance and taxes.

Catastrophe loss . . . . . . . . . . . . Loss and directly identified loss adjustment expenses from

catastrophes, as well as related reinsurance reinstatement premiums
and assessments from various pools.

Catastrophe reinsurance . . . . . . A form of excess-of-loss reinsurance which, subject to a specified
limit, indemnifies the ceding company for the amount of loss in
excess of a specified retention with respect to an accumulation of
losses and related reinsurance reinstatement premiums resulting
from a catastrophic event. The actual reinsurance document is
called a ‘‘catastrophe cover.’’ These reinsurance contracts are
typically designed to cover property insurance losses but can be
written to cover casualty insurance losses such as from workers’
compensation policies.

Cede; ceding company . . . . . . . When an insurer reinsures its liability with another insurer or a
‘‘cession,’’ it ‘‘cedes’’ business and is referred to as the ‘‘ceding
company.’’

Cohort . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . A group of items or individuals that share a particular statistical or

demographic characteristic. For example, all claims for a given
product in a given market for a given accident year would represent
a cohort of claims.

Combined ratio . . . . . . . . . . . . For Statutory Accounting Practices (SAP), the combined ratio is the

sum of the SAP loss and LAE ratio and the SAP underwriting
expense ratio as defined in the statutory financial statements
required by insurance regulators. The combined ratio as used in this
report is the equivalent of, and is calculated in the same manner as,
the SAP combined ratio except that the SAP underwriting expense
ratio is based on net written premium and the underwriting expense
ratio as used in this report is based on net earned premiums.

37

The combined ratio is an indicator of the Company’s underwriting
discipline, efficiency in acquiring and servicing its business and
overall underwriting profitability. A combined ratio under 100%
generally indicates an underwriting profit. A combined ratio over
100% generally indicates an underwriting loss.
Other companies’ method of computing a similarly titled measure
may not be comparable to the Company’s method of computing this
ratio.

Commercial multi-peril policies . Refers to policies which cover both property and third-party liability

exposures.

Commutation agreement . . . . . . An agreement between a reinsurer and a ceding company whereby

the reinsurer pays an agreed-upon amount in exchange for a
complete discharge of all obligations, including future obligations,

realized investment gains (losses), discontinued operations, the
effect of a change in tax laws and tax rates at enactment date, and
cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles when
applicable. Financial statement users consider core income when
analyzing the results and trends of insurance companies.

Debt-to-total capital ratio . . . . . The ratio of debt to total capitalization.
Debt-to-total capital ratio

contracts, consisting of commissions (other than contingent
commissions) and premium-related taxes that are deferred and
amortized to achieve a matching of revenues and expenses when
reported in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S.
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).

Deficiency . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . With regard to reserves for a given liability, a deficiency exists when

Demand surge . . . . . . . . . . . . .

it is estimated or determined that the reserves are insufficient to
pay the ultimate settlement value of the related liabilities. Where
the deficiency is the result of an estimate, the estimated amount of
deficiency (or even the finding of whether or not a deficiency exists)
may change as new information becomes available.
Significant short-term increases in building material and labor costs
due to a sharp increase in demand for those materials and services,
commonly as a result of a large catastrophe resulting in significant
widespread property damage.

38

Direct written premiums . . . . . . The amounts charged by an insurer to insureds in exchange for

contract. The amounts exclude the impact of all reinsurance
premiums, either assumed or ceded.

Earned premiums or premiums

earned . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . That portion of property casualty premiums written that applies to

the expired portion of the policy term. Earned premiums are
recognized as revenues under both SAP and GAAP.

Excess and surplus lines

insurance . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Insurance for risks not covered by standard insurance due to the
unique nature of the risk. Risks could be placed in excess and
surplus lines markets due to any number of characteristics, such as
loss experience, unique or unusual exposures, or insufficient
experience in business. Excess and surplus lines are less regulated
by the states, allowing greater flexibility to design specific insurance
coverage and negotiate pricing based on the risks to be secured.

Excess liability . . . . . . . . . . . . . Additional casualty coverage above a layer of insurance exposures.
Excess-of-loss reinsurance . . . . . Reinsurance that indemnifies the reinsured against all or a specified

portion of losses over a specified dollar amount or ‘‘retention.’’

Exposure . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The measure of risk used in the pricing of an insurance product.
The change in exposure is the amount of change in premium on
policies that renew attributable to the change in portfolio risk.

Facultative reinsurance . . . . . . . The reinsurance of all or a portion of the insurance provided by a

single policy. Each policy reinsured is separately negotiated.

Fair Access to Insurance

Requirements (FAIR) Plan . . A residual market mechanism which provides property insurance to

those unable to obtain such insurance through the regular
(voluntary) market. FAIR plans are set up on a state-by-state basis
to cover only those risks in that state. For more information, see
‘‘residual market (involuntary business).’’

Fidelity and surety programs . . . Fidelity insurance coverage protects an insured for loss due to

embezzlement or misappropriation of funds by an employee. Surety
is a three-party agreement in which the insurer agrees to pay a
third party or complete an obligation in response to the default,
acts or omissions of an insured.

Gross written premiums . . . . . . The direct and assumed contractually determined amounts charged

to the policyholders for the effective period of the contract based
on the terms and conditions of the insurance contract.

Ground-up analysis . . . . . . . . . . A method to estimate ultimate claim costs for a given cohort of

claims such as an accident year/product line component. It involves
analyzing the exposure and claim activity at an individual insured
level and then through the use of deterministic or stochastic
scenarios and/or simulations, estimating the ultimate losses for those
insureds. The total losses for the cohort are then the sum of the
losses for each individual insured.

39

In practice, the method is sometimes simplified by performing the
individual insured analysis only for the larger insureds, with the
costs for the smaller insureds estimated via sampling approaches
(extrapolated to the rest of the smaller insured population) or
aggregate approaches (using assumptions consistent with the
ground-up larger insured analysis).

Guaranteed-cost products . . . . . An insurance policy where the premiums charged will not be
adjusted for actual loss experience during the covered period.

Guaranty fund . . . . . . . . . . . . . A state-regulated mechanism that is financed by assessing insurers

doing business in those states. Should insolvencies occur, these
funds are available to meet some or all of the insolvent insurer’s
obligations to policyholders.

Holding company liquidity . . . . . Total cash, short-term invested assets and other readily marketable

securities held by the holding company.

Incurred but not reported

(IBNR) reserves . . . . . . . . . . Reserves for estimated losses and LAE that have been incurred but

not yet reported to the insurer. This includes amounts for
unreported claims, development on known cases, and re-opened
claims.

transported from one place to another, as well as bridges, tunnels
and other instrumentalities of transportation. It includes goods in
transit, generally other than transoceanic, and may include policies
for movable objects such as personal effects, personal property,
jewelry, furs, fine art and others.

IRIS ratios . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Financial ratios calculated by the NAIC to assist state insurance
departments in monitoring the financial condition of insurance
companies.

Large deductible policy . . . . . . . An insurance policy where the customer assumes at least $25,000 or

more of each loss. Typically, the insurer is responsible for paying
the entire loss under those policies and then seeks reimbursement
from the insured for the deductible amount.

Lloyd’s . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . An insurance marketplace based in London, England, where

brokers, representing clients with insurable risks, deal with Lloyd’s
underwriters, who represent investors. The investors are grouped
together into syndicates that provide capital to insure the risks.

Loss . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . An occurrence that is the basis for submission and/or payment of a

claim. Losses may be covered, limited or excluded from coverage,
depending on the terms of the policy.

Loss adjustment expenses

(LAE) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The expenses of settling claims, including legal and other fees and
the portion of general expenses allocated to claim settlement costs.

40

Loss and LAE ratio . . . . . . . . . For SAP, the loss and LAE ratio is the ratio of incurred losses and

loss adjustment expenses less certain administrative services fee
income to net earned premiums as defined in the statutory financial
statements required by insurance regulators. The loss and LAE
ratio as used in this report is calculated in the same manner as the
SAP ratio.
The loss and LAE ratio is an indicator of the Company’s
underwriting discipline and underwriting profitability.
Other companies’ method of computing a similarly titled measure
may not be comparable to the Company’s method of computing this
ratio.

Loss reserves . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Liabilities established by insurers and reinsurers to reflect the

estimated cost of claims incurred that the insurer or reinsurer will
ultimately be required to pay in respect of insurance or reinsurance
it has written. Reserves are established for losses and for LAE, and

this document, ‘‘loss reserves’’ is meant to include reserves for both
losses and LAE.

Loss reserve development . . . . . The increase or decrease in incurred claims and claim adjustment

expenses as a result of the re-estimation of claims and claim
adjustment expense reserves at successive valuation dates for a
given group of claims. Loss reserve development may be related to

percentage of liabilities, premiums and losses for each policy
covered on a pro rata basis.

Rates . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Amounts charged per unit of insurance.
Redundancy . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . With regard to reserves for a given liability, a redundancy exists
when it is estimated or determined that the reserves are greater
than what will be needed to pay the ultimate settlement value of
the related liabilities. Where the redundancy is the result of an
estimate, the estimated amount of redundancy (or even the finding
of whether or not a redundancy exists) may change as new
information becomes available.

Reinstatement premiums . . . . . . Additional premiums payable to reinsurers to restore coverage

limits that have been exhausted as a result of reinsured losses under
certain excess-of-loss reinsurance treaties.

Reinsurance . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The practice whereby one insurer, called the reinsurer, in

based on a number of factors, including changes in estimates.

Residual market (involuntary

business) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Insurance market which provides coverage for risks for those unable
to purchase insurance in the voluntary market. Possible reasons for
this inability include the risks being too great or the profit potential
too small under the required insurance rate structure. Residual
markets are frequently created by state legislation either because of
lack of available coverage such as: property coverage in a
windstorm prone area or protection of the accident victim as in the
case of workers’ compensation. The costs of the residual market are
usually charged back to the direct insurance carriers in proportion
to the carriers’ voluntary market shares for the type of coverage
involved.

Retention . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The amount of exposure a policyholder company retains on any one

risk or group of risks. The term may apply to an insurance policy,

shareholders’ equity.

Risk-based capital (RBC) . . . . . A measure adopted by the NAIC and enacted by states for

determining the minimum statutory policyholders’ surplus
requirements of insurers. Insurers having total adjusted capital less
than that required by the RBC calculation will be subject to varying
degrees of regulatory action depending on the level of capital
inadequacy.

Risk retention group . . . . . . . . . An alternative form of insurance in which members of a similar

profession or business band together to self insure their risks.
Runoff business . . . . . . . . . . . . An operation which has been determined to be nonstrategic;

new business, where allowed by law.

Salvage . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The amount of money an insurer recovers through the sale of

property transferred to the insurer as a result of a loss payment.

S-curve method . . . . . . . . . . . . A mathematical function which depicts an initial slow change,

followed by a rapid change and then ending in a slow change again.
This results in an ‘‘S’’ shaped line when depicted graphically. The

for a particular cohort of claims to an S-curve to project future
activity for that cohort.

Second-injury fund . . . . . . . . . . The employer of an injured, impaired worker is responsible only for

the workers’ compensation benefit for the most recent injury; the
second-injury fund would cover the cost of any additional benefits

insurance industry and self-insureds, funded through assessments to
insurance companies and self-insureds based on either premiums or
losses.

Segment income (loss) . . . . . . . Determined in the same manner as core income (loss) on a

decisions. Financial statement users also consider segment income
when analyzing the results and trends of insurance companies.

Self-insured retentions . . . . . . . That portion of the risk retained by a person for its own account.
Servicing carrier . . . . . . . . . . . . An insurance company that provides, for a fee, various services

including policy issuance, claims adjusting and customer service for
insureds in a reinsurance pool.

43

Statutory accounting practices

(SAP) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The practices and procedures prescribed or permitted by domiciliary

state insurance regulatory authorities in the United States for
recording transactions and preparing financial statements. SAP
generally reflect a modified going concern basis of accounting.
Statutory capital and surplus . . . The excess of an insurance company’s admitted assets over its

liabilities, including loss reserves, as determined in accordance with
SAP. Admitted assets are assets of an insurer prescribed or
permitted by a state to be recognized on the statutory balance
sheet. Statutory capital and surplus is also referred to as ‘‘statutory
surplus’’ or ‘‘policyholders’ surplus.’’

Statutory net income . . . . . . . . . As determined under SAP, total revenues less total expenses and

income taxes.

Structured settlements . . . . . . . . Periodic payments to an injured person or survivor for a determined

an insurance company, after paying a claim under a policy, to
recover the amount of the loss from another person or entity who is
legally liable for it.

Tenure impact

. . . . . . . . . . . . . As new business volume increases and accounts for a greater

percentage of earned premiums, the loss and LAE ratio generally
worsens initially, as the loss and LAE ratio for new business is
generally higher than the ratio for business that has been retained
for longer periods. As poorer performing business leaves and
pricing segmentation improves on renewal of the business that is
retained, the loss and LAE ratio is expected to improve in future
years.

Third-party liability . . . . . . . . . . A liability owed to a claimant (third party) who is not one of the
two parties to the insurance contract. Insured liability claims are
referred to as third-party claims.

primary insurer or reinsured is obligated to offer and the reinsurer
is obligated to accept a specified portion of all that type or category
of risks originally written by the primary insurer or reinsured.

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS

You should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this

report, including without limitation our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and
‘‘Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—
Critical Accounting Estimates.’’

Catastrophe losses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, our financial
position and/or liquidity, and could adversely impact our ratings, our ability to raise capital and the
availability and cost of reinsurance. Our property and casualty insurance operations expose us to
claims arising out of catastrophes. Catastrophes can be caused by various natural events, including,
among others, hurricanes, tornadoes and other windstorms, earthquakes, hail, wildfires, severe winter
weather, floods, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions and other naturally-occurring events, such as solar flares.
Catastrophes can also be man-made, such as terrorist attacks and other intentionally destructive acts
including those involving nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological events, cyber events, explosions
and destruction of infrastructure. The geographic distribution of our business subjects us to catastrophe
exposures in the United States and Canada, which include, but are not limited to: hurricanes from
Maine through Texas; tornadoes and hail storms throughout the Central, Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern
regions of the United States; earthquakes in California, the New Madrid region and the Pacific
Northwest region of North America; wildfires, particularly in western states and Canada; and terrorism
in major cities in the United States. In addition to our operations in the United States and Canada, our
international operations subject us to catastrophe exposures in the United Kingdom, the Republic of
Ireland and Brazil as well as to a variety of worldwide catastrophe exposures through our Lloyd’s
operations.

The incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable, and it is possible that both
the frequency and severity of natural and man-made catastrophic events could increase. Severe weather
events over the last two decades have underscored the unpredictability of future climate trends, and
potentially changing climate conditions could add to the frequency and severity of natural disasters and
create additional uncertainty as to future trends and exposures. For example, over the last two decades,
hurricane activity has impacted areas further inland than previously experienced by us, and
demographic changes have resulted in larger populations in coastal areas which historically have been
subject to severe storms and related storm surge, thus expanding our potential for losses from
hurricanes. Demographic changes in areas prone to wildfires have also expanded our potential for
losses from wildfires. Additionally, both the frequency and severity of tornado and hail storms in the
United States have been more volatile during the last decade. Moreover, we could experience more
than one severe catastrophic event in any given period.

46

All of the catastrophe modeling tools that we use, or that we rely on from outside parties, to

evaluate certain of our catastrophe exposures are based on assumptions and judgments that are subject
to error and mis-estimation and may produce estimates that are materially different than actual results.
In addition, compared to models for hurricanes, models for earthquakes are less reliable due to there
being a more limited number of significant historical events to analyze, while models for tornadoes and
hail storms are newer and may be even less reliable due to the highly random geographic nature and
size of these events. As a result, models for earthquakes and tornado and hail storms may have even
greater difficulty predicting risks and estimating losses. Further, changes in climate conditions could
cause our underlying modeling data to be less predictive, thus limiting our ability to effectively evaluate
and manage catastrophe risk. As compared to natural catastrophes, modeling for man-made
catastrophes, such as terrorism and cyber events, is even more difficult and less reliable, and for some
events (both natural and man-made), currently there are no reliable modeling techniques. See ‘‘We may
be adversely affected if our pricing and capital models provide materially different indications than
actual results’’ below as well as ‘‘Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations—Catastrophe Modeling’’ and ‘‘—Changing Climate Conditions.’’

The extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of the total amount of insured exposure

affected by the event, the severity of the event and the coverage provided, which can be both property
and casualty coverages. Increases in the value and geographic concentration of insured property, the
number of policyholders exposed to certain events and the effects of inflation could increase the
severity of claims from catastrophic events in the future. For example, the specific geographic location
impacted by tornadoes is inherently random and unpredictable and the specific location impacted by a
tornado may or may not be highly populated and may or may not have a high concentration of our
insured exposures. Similarly, the potential for losses from a cyber event can be larger to the extent that
the event impacts platforms, systems or vulnerabilities shared by a large number of policyholders.

States have from time to time passed legislation, and regulators have taken action, that have the

effect of limiting the ability of insurers to manage catastrophe risk, such as legislation prohibiting
insurers from reducing exposures or withdrawing from catastrophe-prone areas or mandating that
insurers participate in residual markets. Participation in residual market mechanisms has resulted in,
and may continue to result in, significant losses or assessments to insurers, including us, and, in certain
states, those losses or assessments may not be commensurate with our direct catastrophe exposure in
those states. If our competitors leave those states having residual market mechanisms, remaining
insurers, including us, may be subject to significant increases in losses or assessments following a
catastrophe. In addition, following catastrophes, there are sometimes legislative and administrative
initiatives and court decisions that seek to expand insurance coverage for catastrophe claims beyond the
original intent of the policies or seek to prevent the application of deductibles. Also, our ability to
adjust terms, including deductible levels, or to increase pricing to the extent necessary to offset rising
costs of catastrophes, particularly in the Personal Insurance segment, requires approval of regulatory
authorities of certain states. Our ability or our willingness to manage our catastrophe exposure by
raising prices, modifying underwriting terms or reducing exposure to certain geographies may be limited
due to considerations of public policy, the evolving political environment and/or changes in the general
economic climate. We also may choose to write business in catastrophe-prone areas that we might not
otherwise write for strategic purposes, such as improving our access to other underwriting
opportunities.

There are also factors that impact the estimation of ultimate costs for catastrophes. For example,

the estimation of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves related to hurricanes can be affected by
the inability to access portions of the impacted areas, the complexity of factors contributing to the
losses, the limited availability of the necessary labor and supplies, the legal and regulatory uncertainties
and the nature of the information available to establish the claims and claim adjustment expense
reserves. Complex factors include, but are not limited to: determining whether damage was caused by

47

flooding versus wind; evaluating general liability and pollution exposures; estimating additional living
expenses; the impact of demand surge; infrastructure disruption; fraud; the effect of mold damage;
business interruption costs; late reported claims; litigation; and reinsurance collectability. The timing of
a catastrophe’s occurrence, such as at or near the end of a reporting period, can also affect the
information available to us in estimating claims and claim adjustment expense reserves for that
reporting period. The estimates related to catastrophes are adjusted in subsequent periods as actual
claims emerge and additional information becomes available.

Exposure to catastrophe losses or actual losses resulting from a catastrophe could adversely affect

our financial strength and claims-paying ratings and could impair our ability to raise capital on
acceptable terms or at all. Also, as a result of our exposure to catastrophe losses or actual losses
following a catastrophe, rating agencies may further increase capital requirements, which may require
us to raise capital to maintain our ratings. A ratings downgrade could hurt our ability to compete
effectively or attract new business. In addition, catastrophic events could cause us to exhaust our
available reinsurance limits and could adversely impact the cost and availability of reinsurance. Such
events can also impact the credit of our reinsurers. For a discussion of our catastrophe reinsurance
coverage, see ‘‘Item 1—Business—Reinsurance—Catastrophe Reinsurance.’’ Catastrophic events could
also adversely impact the credit of the issuers of securities, such as states or municipalities, in which we
have invested.

In addition, coverage in our reinsurance program for terrorism is limited. Although the Terrorism
Risk Insurance Program provides benefits in the event of certain acts of terrorism, those benefits are
subject to a deductible and other limitations and the program is scheduled to expire on December 31,
2020. Under current provisions of this program, once our losses exceed 20% of our commercial
property and casualty insurance premium for the preceding calendar year, the federal government will
reimburse us for 82% of our losses attributable to certain acts of terrorism which exceed this deductible
up to a total industry program cap of $100 billion. Our estimated deductible under the program is
$2.46 billion for 2018. Over the remaining three-year life of the reauthorized program, the federal
government reimbursement percentage will fall from 82% to 80%. In addition, because the
interpretation of this law is untested, there is substantial uncertainty as to how it will be applied to
specific circumstances. For example, application of the law to a specific event will depend upon whether
the government has designated such event as a covered event. It is also possible that future legislation
could change or eliminate the program, which could adversely affect our business by increasing our
exposure to terrorism losses, or by lowering our business volume through efforts to avoid that exposure.
For a further description of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program, see note 5 of notes to the
consolidated financial statements.

Because of the risks set forth above, catastrophes such as those caused by various natural or
man-made events, such as a terrorist attack or other intentionally destructive acts, including those
involving nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological events or cyber events, could materially and
adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and/or liquidity. Further, we may not have
sufficient resources to respond to claims arising from a high frequency of high-severity natural
catastrophes and/or of man-made catastrophic events involving conventional means. In addition, while
we seek to manage our exposure to man-made catastrophic events involving conventional means, we
may not have sufficient resources to respond to claims arising out of one or more man-made
catastrophic events involving ‘‘unconventional’’ means, such as nuclear, biological, chemical or
radiological events.

If actual claims exceed our claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, or if changes in the

estimated level of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves are necessary, including as a result of,
among other things, changes in the legal, regulatory and economic environments in which the
Company operates, our financial results could be materially and adversely affected. Claims and claim
adjustment expense reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability, but instead represent

48

management estimates of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost, generally
utilizing actuarial expertise and projection techniques, at a given accounting date.

The process of estimating claims and claim adjustment expense reserves involves a high degree of
judgment and is subject to a number of variables. These variables can be affected by both internal and
external events, such as: changes in claims handling procedures; adverse changes in loss cost trends,
including inflationary pressures and technology changes which may impact medical, auto and home
repair costs; economic conditions including general and wage inflation; legal trends and legislative
changes; and varying judgments and viewpoints of the individuals involved in the estimation process,
among others. The impact of many of these items on ultimate costs for claims and claim adjustment
expenses is difficult to estimate. Claims and claim adjustment expense reserve estimation difficulties
also differ significantly by product line due to differences in claim complexity, the volume of claims, the
potential severity of individual claims, the determination of occurrence date for a claim and reporting
lags (the time between the occurrence of the policyholder event and when it is actually reported to the
insurer).

It is possible that, among other things, past or future steps taken by the federal government and

the Federal Reserve to stimulate the U.S. economy, including actions to manage interest rates, tax
reform and changes in international trade regulation, could lead to higher inflation than we had
anticipated, which could in turn lead to an increase in our loss costs. The impact of inflation on loss
costs could be more pronounced for those lines of business that are considered ‘‘long tail,’’ such as
general liability, as they require a relatively long period of time to finalize and settle claims for a given
accident year. In addition, a significant portion of claims costs, including those in ‘‘long tail’’ lines of
business, consists of medical costs. Changes in healthcare legislation could significantly impact the
availability, cost and allocation of payments for medical services, and it is possible that, as a result,
inflationary pressures in medical costs may increase or claim frequency and/or severity may otherwise
be adversely impacted. The estimation of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves may also be
more difficult during times of adverse or uncertain economic conditions due to unexpected changes in
behavior of claimants and policyholders, including an increase in fraudulent reporting of exposures
and/or losses, reduced maintenance of insured properties, increased frequency of small claims or delays
in the reporting of claims. In addition, the estimation of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves
may be influenced by other external factors, including continued intensive advertising by plaintiff
attorneys.

We continually refine our claims and claim adjustment expense reserve estimates in a regular,

ongoing process as historical loss experience develops, additional claims are reported and settled, and
the legal, regulatory and economic environment evolves. Business judgment is applied throughout the
process, including the application of various individual experiences and expertise to multiple sets of
data and analyses. Different experts may choose different assumptions when faced with material
uncertainty, based on their individual backgrounds, professional experiences and areas of focus. Hence,
such experts may at times produce estimates materially different from each other. This risk may be
exacerbated in the context of an acquisition. Experts providing input to the various estimates and
underlying assumptions include actuaries, underwriters, claim personnel and lawyers, as well as other
members of management. Therefore, management may have to consider varying individual viewpoints
as part of its estimation of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.

We attempt to consider all significant facts and circumstances known at the time claims and claim

adjustment expense reserves are established or reviewed. Due to the inherent uncertainty underlying
claims and claim adjustment expense reserve estimates, the final resolution of the estimated liability for
claims and claim adjustment expenses will likely be higher or lower than the related claims and claim
adjustment expense reserves at the reporting date. Therefore, actual paid losses in the future may yield
a materially different amount than is currently reserved.

49

Because of the uncertainties set forth above, additional liabilities resulting from one insured event,

or an accumulation of insured events, may exceed the current related reserves. In addition, our
estimate of claims and claim adjustment expenses may change. These additional liabilities or increases
in estimates, or a range of either, could vary significantly from period to period, cannot now be
reasonably estimated and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and/or our
financial position.

For a discussion of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves by product line, including

examples of common factors that can affect required reserves, see ‘‘Item 7—Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Estimates—Claims
and Claim Adjustment Expense Reserves.’’

During or following a period of financial market disruption or an economic downturn, our

business could be materially and adversely affected. Worldwide financial markets and economic
conditions have, from time to time, experienced significant disruption or deterioration and likely will
experience periods of disruption or deterioration in the future. If financial markets experience
significant disruption or if economic conditions deteriorate, our results of operations, financial position
and/or liquidity likely would be adversely impacted. For example, financial market disruptions and
economic downturns in the past have resulted in, among other things, reduced business volume, as well
as heightened credit risk and reduced valuations for certain of our investments. An inflationary
environment, as a result of government efforts to stabilize the economy after a disruption or otherwise,
may also, as we discuss in risk factors above, adversely impact our loss costs and the valuation of our
investment portfolio.

Financial market disruption or an economic downturn could be exacerbated by actual or potential
economic and geopolitical instability in many regions of the world. This can impact our business even if
we do not conduct business in the region subject to the instability. For example, due to globalization,
instability in one region can spread to other regions where we do business. The United Kingdom’s
withdrawal from the European Union could have a negative impact on economic conditions in the
United Kingdom and could result in unintended consequences in other countries as well. In the United
States, actions or inactions of the United States government may also impact economic conditions. For
example, the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 as well as actions that may be taken by
the U.S. administration to address the U.S. Federal budget, the national debt, international trade, the
Affordable Care Act and regulation generally, among other things, may contribute, positively or
negatively, to economic conditions generally and create economic and fiscal uncertainty.

Several of the risk factors discussed above and below identify risks that could result from, or be
exacerbated by, financial market disruption, an economic slowdown or economic uncertainty. These
include risks discussed above related to our estimates of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves,
and those discussed below related to our investment portfolio, the competitive environment, emerging
claim and coverage issues, reinsurance arrangements, other credit exposures, regulatory developments
and the impact of rating agency actions. You should also refer to ‘‘Item 7—Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,’’ particularly the ‘‘Outlook’’ section, for
additional information about these risks and the potential impact on our business.

Our investment portfolio is subject to credit and interest rate risk, and may suffer reduced

returns or material realized or unrealized losses.
overall profitability. Fixed maturity and short-term investments comprised approximately 93% of the
carrying value of our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2017. Changes in interest rates caused by
inflation or other factors (inclusive of credit spreads) affect the carrying value of our fixed maturity
investments and returns on our fixed maturity and short-term investments. A decline in interest rates
reduces the returns available on short-term investments and new fixed maturity investments (including
those purchased to re-invest maturities from the existing portfolio), thereby negatively impacting our

50

net investment income, while rising interest rates reduce the market value of existing fixed maturity
investments, thereby negatively impacting our book value. During 2017, the net pre-tax unrealized gain
in our fixed income portfolio increased from $865 million to $1.38 billion as interest rates decreased.
Any future increases in interest rates (inclusive of credit spreads) would result in a decline in that
unrealized gain position or in an unrealized loss, thereby adversely impacting our book value. Interest
rates in recent years have been and remain at very low levels relative to historical experience, and it is
possible that rates may remain at low levels for a prolonged period. The value of our fixed maturity
and short-term investments is also subject to the risk that certain investments may default or become
impaired due to a deterioration in the financial condition of one or more issuers of the securities held
in our portfolio, or due to a deterioration in the financial condition of an insurer that guarantees an
issuer’s payments of such investments. Such defaults and impairments could reduce our net investment
income and result in realized investment losses. During an economic downturn, fixed maturity and
short-term investments could be subject to a higher risk of default. Rapid changes in commodity prices,
such as a significant decline in oil prices, could also subject certain of our investments to a higher risk
of default.

Our fixed maturity investment portfolio is invested, in substantial part, in obligations of states,

municipalities and political subdivisions (collectively referred to as the municipal bond portfolio).
Notwithstanding the relatively low historical rates of default on many of these obligations and
notwithstanding that we typically seek to invest in high-credit-quality securities (including those with
structural protections such as being secured by dedicated or pledged sources of revenue), our municipal
bond portfolio could be subject to default or impairment. In particular:

(cid:127) In recent years, many state and local governments have been operating under deficits or

projected deficits. The severity and duration of these deficits could have an adverse impact on
the collectability and valuation of our municipal bond portfolio. These deficits may be
exacerbated by the impact of unfunded pension plan obligations and other postretirement
obligations or by declining municipal tax bases and revenues in times of financial stress. The
recent tax reform also could lead state and local governments to decrease taxes, which could
result in a deterioration of the credit quality of these state and local governments.

(cid:127) Some municipal bond issuers may be unwilling to increase tax rates, particularly in light of the

recent tax reform, or to reduce spending, to fund interest or principal payments on their
municipal bonds, or may be unable to access the municipal bond market to fund such payments.
The risk of widespread defaults may increase if some issuers voluntarily choose to default,
instead of implementing difficult fiscal measures, and the actual or perceived consequences (such
as reduced access to capital markets) are less severe than expected.

(cid:127) The risk of widespread defaults may also increase if there are changes in legislation that permit
states, municipalities and political subdivisions to file for bankruptcy protection where they were
not permitted before. In addition, the collectability and valuation of municipal bonds may be
adversely affected if there are judicial interpretations in a bankruptcy or other proceeding that
lessen the value of structural protections. For example, debtors may challenge the effectiveness
of structural protections thought to be provided by municipal securities backed by a dedicated
source of revenue. The collectability and valuation may also be adversely affected if there are
judicial interpretations in a bankruptcy or other proceeding that question the payment priority of
municipal bonds.

Approximately 30% of the fixed maturity portfolio is expected to mature over the next three years
(this includes the early redemption of bonds, assuming interest rates (including credit spreads) do not
rise significantly by applicable call dates). For a schedule of the contractual maturities of our fixed
maturity portfolio by year for the next several years, see ‘‘Item 7—Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Investment Portfolio.’’ As a result, even if

51

our investment strategy does not significantly change over the next few years, the overall yield on and
composition of our portfolio could be meaningfully impacted by the types of investments available for
reinvestment with the proceeds of matured bonds. For example, if yields decrease when we reinvest
such proceeds, our future net investment income would be adversely affected. In addition, depending
on the specific bonds available for purchase at the time of re-investment, the mix of specific issuers in
our fixed-income and municipal bond portfolio will change.

Our portfolio has benefited from tax exemptions (such as those related to interest from municipal

bonds) and certain other tax laws, including, but not limited to, those governing dividends-received
deductions and tax credits. Changes in these laws could adversely impact the value of our investment
portfolio. See ‘‘Changes in U.S. tax laws or in the tax laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate
could adversely impact us’’ below.

Our investment portfolio includes: residential mortgage-backed securities; collateralized mortgage
obligations; pass-through securities and asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages;
commercial mortgage-backed securities; and wholly-owned real estate and real estate partnerships, all
of which could be adversely impacted by declines in real estate valuations and/or financial market
disruption.

We also invest a portion of our assets in equity securities, private equity limited partnerships,
hedge funds and real estate partnerships. From time to time, we may also invest in other types of
non-fixed maturity investments, including investments with exposure to commodity price risk, such as
oil. All of these asset classes are subject to greater volatility in their investment returns than fixed
maturity investments. General economic conditions, changes in applicable tax laws and many other
factors beyond our control can adversely affect the value of our non-fixed maturity investments and the
realization of net investment income, and/or result in realized investment losses. As a result of these
factors, we may realize reduced returns on these investments, incur losses on sales of these investments
and be required to write down the value of these investments, which could reduce our net investment
income and result in realized investment losses. From time to time, the Company enters into short
positions in U.S. Treasury futures contracts to manage the duration of its fixed maturity portfolio,
which can result in realized investment losses.

Our investment portfolio is also subject to increased valuation uncertainties when investment

markets are illiquid. The valuation of investments is more subjective when markets are illiquid, thereby
increasing the risk that the estimated fair value (i.e., the carrying amount) of the portion of the
investment portfolio that is carried at fair value as reflected in our financial statements is not reflective
of prices at which actual transactions could occur.

We may, depending on circumstances in the future, including as a result of changes in economic
and market conditions, or potential consequences of the recent tax reforms, make changes to the mix
of investments in our investment portfolio as part of our ongoing efforts to seek appropriate
risk-adjusted returns. These changes may impact the duration, volatility and risk of our investment
portfolio.

Because of the risks set forth above, the value of our investment portfolio could decrease, we

could experience reduced net investment income and we could experience realized and/or unrealized
investment losses, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial
position and/or liquidity.

Our business could be harmed because of our potential exposure to asbestos and environmental

claims and related litigation. With regard to asbestos claims, we have received and continue to
receive a significant number of asbestos claims from policyholders (including others seeking coverage
under a policy). Factors underlying these claim filings include continued intensive advertising by lawyers
seeking asbestos claimants and the continued focus by plaintiffs on defendants who were not

52

traditionally primary targets of asbestos litigation. The focus on these defendants is primarily the result
of the number of traditional asbestos defendants who have sought bankruptcy protection in previous
years. The bankruptcy of many traditional defendants has also caused increased settlement demands
against those policyholders who are not in bankruptcy but remain in the tort system. Currently, in many
jurisdictions, those who allege very serious injury and who can present credible medical evidence of
their injuries are receiving priority trial settings in the courts, while those who have not shown any
credible disease manifestation are having their hearing dates delayed or placed on an inactive docket.
This trend of prioritizing claims involving credible evidence of injuries, along with the focus on
defendants who were not traditionally primary targets of asbestos litigation, has contributed to the
claims and claim adjustment expense payments we experienced.

We also continue to be involved in coverage litigation concerning a number of policyholders, some

of whom have filed for bankruptcy, who in some instances have asserted that all or a portion of their
asbestos-related claims are not subject to aggregate limits on coverage. In these instances, policyholders
also may assert that each individual bodily injury claim should be treated as a separate occurrence
under the policy. It is difficult to predict whether these policyholders will be successful on both issues.
To the extent both issues are resolved in a policyholder’s favor and our other defenses are not
successful, our coverage obligations under the policies at issue would be materially increased and
bounded only by the applicable per-occurrence limits and the number of asbestos bodily injury claims
against the policyholders. Although we have seen a moderation in the overall risk associated with these
lawsuits, it remains difficult to predict the ultimate cost of these claims.

Further, in addition to claims against policyholders, proceedings have been launched directly

against insurers, including us, by individuals challenging insurers’ conduct with respect to the handling
of past asbestos claims and by individuals seeking damages arising from alleged asbestos-related bodily
injuries. It is possible that the filing of other direct actions against insurers, including us, could be made
in the future. It is difficult to predict the outcome of these proceedings, including whether the plaintiffs
will be able to sustain these actions against insurers based on novel legal theories of liability.

With regard to environmental claims, we have received and continue to receive claims from

policyholders who allege that they are liable for injury or damage arising out of their alleged
disposition of toxic substances. Mostly, these claims arise under various legislative as well as regulatory
efforts aimed at environmental remediation. For instance, the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), enacted in 1980 and later modified, enables private parties
as well as federal and state governments to take action with respect to releases and threatened releases
of hazardous substances. This federal statute permits the recovery of response costs from some liable
parties and may require liable parties to undertake their own remedial action. Liability under CERCLA
and similar state laws may be imposed on certain parties even if they did not cause the release or
threatened release of hazardous substances and may be joint and several with other responsible parties.

The Company has been, and continues to be, involved in litigation involving insurance coverage

issues pertaining to asbestos and environmental claims. The Company believes that some court
decisions have interpreted the insurance coverage to be broader than the original intent of the insurers
and policyholders. These decisions continue to be inconsistent and vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.
Uncertainties surrounding the final resolution of these asbestos and environmental claims continue,

and it is difficult to estimate our ultimate liability for such claims and related litigation. As a result,
these reserves are subject to revision as new information becomes available and as claims develop. The
continuing uncertainties include, without limitation:

(cid:127) the risks and lack of predictability inherent in complex litigation;
(cid:127) a further increase in the cost to resolve, and/or the number of, asbestos and environmental

claims beyond that which is anticipated;

53

(cid:127) the emergence of a greater number of asbestos claims than anticipated as a result of extended

life expectancies resulting from medical advances and lifestyle improvements;

(cid:127) the role of any umbrella or excess policies we have issued;
(cid:127) the resolution or adjudication of disputes concerning coverage for asbestos and environmental

claims in a manner inconsistent with our previous assessment of these disputes;

(cid:127) the number and outcome of direct actions against us;
(cid:127) future developments pertaining to our ability to recover reinsurance for asbestos and

environmental claims;

(cid:127) any impact on asbestos defendants we insure due to the bankruptcy of other asbestos

defendants;

(cid:127) the unavailability of other insurance sources potentially available to policyholders, whether

through exhaustion of policy limits or through the insolvency of other participating insurers; and

(cid:127) uncertainties arising from the insolvency or bankruptcy of policyholders.
It is also not possible to predict changes in the legal, regulatory and legislative environment and

their impact on the future development of asbestos and environmental claims. This environment could
be affected by changes in applicable legislation and future court and regulatory decisions and
interpretations, including the outcome of legal challenges to legislative and/or judicial reforms
establishing medical criteria for the pursuit of asbestos claims. It is also difficult to predict the ultimate
outcome of complex coverage disputes until settlement negotiations near completion and significant
legal questions are resolved or, failing settlement, until the dispute is adjudicated. This is particularly
the case with policyholders in bankruptcy where negotiations often involve a large number of claimants
and other parties and require court approval to be effective.

While the ongoing evaluation of asbestos and environmental claims and associated liabilities

considers the inconsistencies of court decisions as to coverage, plaintiffs’ expanded theories of liability
and the risks inherent in complex litigation and other uncertainties, it is possible that the outcome of
the continued uncertainties regarding these claims could result in liability in future periods that differs
from current reserves by an amount that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.

‘‘Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.’’

The intense competition that we face, and the impact of innovation, technological change and

changing customer preferences on the insurance industry and the markets in which we operate, could
harm our ability to maintain or increase our business volumes and our profitability. The property
and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive, and we believe that it will remain highly
competitive for the foreseeable future. We compete with both domestic and foreign insurers, including
an increasing number of start-ups, which may offer products at prices and on terms that are not
consistent with our economic standards in an effort to maintain or increase their business. The
competitive environment in which we operate could also be impacted by current general economic
conditions, which could reduce the volume of business available to us as well as to our competitors. In
recent years, pension and hedge funds and other entities with substantial available capital and
potentially lower return objectives have increasingly sought to participate in the property and casualty
insurance and reinsurance businesses. Well-capitalized new entrants to the property and casualty
insurance and reinsurance industries, existing competitors that receive substantial infusions of capital, as
well as competitors that can take advantage of more favorable tax domiciles than the United States,
may conduct business in ways that adversely impact our business volumes and profitability. Further, an
expanded supply of reinsurance capital may lower costs for insurers that rely significantly on

54

reinsurance and, as a consequence, those insurers may be able to price their products more
competitively. In addition, the competitive environment could be impacted by changes in customer
preferences, including customer demand for direct distribution channels and/or greater choice, not only
in personal lines (where we currently and may increasingly compete against direct writers), but also in
commercial lines (where direct writers may become a more significant source of competition in the
future, particularly in the small commercial market). Similarly, customer behavior could evolve in the
future towards buying insurance in point-of-sale distribution channels. We do not currently have a
presence in that distribution channel. Consolidation within the insurance industry also could alter the
competitive environment in which we operate, which may impact our business volumes and/or the rates
or terms of our products.

In Personal Insurance, the use of comparative rating technologies has impacted, and may continue

to impact, our business as well as the industry as a whole. A substantial amount of the Company’s
Personal Insurance new business is written after an agent compares quotes using comparative rating
technologies, a cost-efficient means of obtaining quotes from multiple companies. Because the use of
this technology, whether by agents or directly by customers, facilitates the process of generating
multiple quotes, the technology has increased price comparison on new business and, increasingly, on
renewal business. It also has resulted in an increase in the level of quote activity and a lower
percentage of quotes that result in new business from customers, and these trends may continue or
accelerate. If we are not able to operate with a competitive cost structure or accurately estimate and
price for claims and claim adjustment expenses, our business volume and underwriting margins could
be adversely affected over time. Additionally, similar technology is starting to be used to access
comparative rates for small commercial business and that trend is likely to continue and may
accelerate.

Technology companies or other third parties have created, and may in the future create, digitally-

enabled business models, platforms or alternate distribution channels for personal or commercial
business that may adversely impact our competitive position. These technology companies or other
third parties may compete with us directly by providing, or arranging to provide, insurance coverage
themselves. See also ‘‘Disruptions to our relationships with our independent agents and brokers could
adversely affect us’’ below.

Other technological changes also present competitive risks. For example, innovations, such as

telematics and other usage-based methods of determining premiums, can impact product design and
pricing and may become an increasingly important competitive factor. In addition, our competitive
position could be impacted if we are unable to deploy, in a cost effective manner, technology that
collects and analyzes a wide variety of data points (so-called ‘‘big data’’ analysis) to make underwriting
or other decisions, or if our competitors collect and use data which we do not have the ability to access
or use, or are able to use such data more efficiently and/or effectively than we are able to. See also
‘‘Our business success and profitability depend, in part, on effective information technology systems and
on continuing to develop and implement improvements in technology, particularly as our business
processes become more digital’’ below.

Competitive dynamics may impact the success of efforts to improve our underwriting margins on
our insurance products. These efforts could include seeking improved rates, as well as improved terms
and conditions, and could also include other initiatives, such as reducing operating expenses and
acquisition costs. These efforts may not be successful and/or may result in lower retention and new
business levels and therefore lower business volumes. In addition, if our underwriting is not effective,
further efforts to increase rates could also lead to ‘‘adverse selection’’, whereby accounts retained have
higher losses, and are less profitable, than accounts lost. For more detail, see ‘‘Item 7—Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Outlook.’’

55

Similar to other industries, the insurance industry is undergoing rapid and significant technological

and other change. Traditional insurance industry participants, technology companies, ‘‘InsurTech’’
start-up companies, the number of which has increased significantly in recent years, and others are
focused on using technology and innovation to simplify and improve the customer experience, increase
efficiencies, redesign products, alter business models and effect other potentially disruptive changes in
the insurance industry. If we do not anticipate, keep pace with and adapt to technological and other
changes impacting the insurance industry, it will harm our ability to compete, decrease the value of our
products to customers, and materially and adversely affect our business. Furthermore, innovation,
technological change and changing customer preferences in the markets in which we operate also pose
risks to our business. For example, technologies such as driverless vehicles, assisted-driving or accident
prevention technologies, technologies that facilitate ride or home sharing, smart homes or automation
could reduce the number of vehicles in use and/or the demand for, or profitability of, certain of our
products, create coverage issues or impact the frequency or severity of losses, and we may not be able
to respond effectively.

Overall, our competitive position in our various businesses is based on many factors, including but

not limited to our:

(cid:127) ability to profitably price our business, retain existing customers and obtain new business;
(cid:127) premiums charged, contract terms and conditions, products and services offered (including the

ability to design customized programs);

(cid:127) agent, broker and policyholder relationships;
(cid:127) ability to keep pace relative to our competitors with changes in technology and information

systems;

(cid:127) effectiveness of our claims process, including the speed of payment;
(cid:127) ability to avoid and mitigate fraudulent claims;
(cid:127) ability to provide our products and services in a cost effective manner;
(cid:127) ability to provide new products and services to meet changing customer needs;
(cid:127) ability to adapt to changes in business models, technology, customer preferences or regulation

impacting the markets in which we operate;

(cid:127) perceived overall financial strength and corresponding ratings assigned by independent rating

agencies;

(cid:127) reputation, experience and qualifications of employees;
(cid:127) geographic scope of business; and
(cid:127) local presence.
We may have difficulty in continuing to compete successfully on any of these bases in the future. If

competition or technological or other changes to the markets in which we operate limit our ability to
retain existing business or write new business at adequate rates or on appropriate terms, our results of
operations could be materially and adversely affected. See ‘‘Competition’’ sections of the discussion on
business segments in ‘‘Item 1—Business.’’

Disruptions to our relationships with our independent agents and brokers could adversely affect

us. We market our insurance products primarily through independent agents and brokers. An
important part of our business is written through less than a dozen such intermediaries. Further, there
has been a trend of increased consolidation by agents and brokers, which could impact our
relationships with, and fees paid to, some agents and brokers, and/or otherwise negatively impact the

56

pricing or distribution of our products. Agents and brokers may increasingly compete with us to the
extent that markets increasingly provide them with direct access to providers of capital seeking
exposure to insurance risk. See also ‘‘The intense competition that we face could harm our ability to
maintain or increase our business volumes and our profitability.’’ In all of the foregoing situations, loss
of all or a substantial portion of the business provided through such agents and brokers could
materially and adversely affect our future business volume and results of operations.

We may also seek to develop new products or distribution channels, which could disrupt our

relationships with our agents and brokers. In addition, agents and brokers may create alternate
distribution channels for commercial business that may adversely impact product differentiation and
pricing. Access to greater levels of data and increased utilization of technology by agents and brokers
may also impact our relationship with them and our competitive position. Our efforts or their efforts
with respect to new products or alternate distribution channels, as well as changes in the way agents
and brokers utilize data and technology, could adversely impact our business relationship with
independent agents and brokers who currently market our products, resulting in a lower volume and/or
profitability of business generated from these sources.

In certain markets, brokers increasingly have been packaging portfolios of risks together and

offering them to a narrower range of carriers as well as, in some cases, requesting a commitment to
participate in such portfolios in advance. In these and other situations, agents and brokers have an
increased influence over policy language which, if we participate on that basis, could adversely impact
our ability to profitably manage underwriting risk. It could also lead to commoditization of products,
which could increase the focus on price and cost management and decrease our ability to differentiate
our products in the marketplace with customers based on other factors.

We rely on internet applications for the marketing and sale of certain of our products, and we may

increasingly rely on internet applications and toll-free numbers for distribution. In some instances, our
agents and brokers are required to access separate business platforms to execute the sale of our
personal insurance or commercial insurance products. Should internet disruptions occur, or frustration
with our business platforms or distribution initiatives develop among our independent agents and
brokers, any resulting loss of business could materially and adversely affect our future business volume
and results of operations. See ‘‘If we experience difficulties with technology, data and network security
(including as a result of cyber attacks), outsourcing relationships or cloud-based technology, our ability
to conduct our business could be negatively impacted’’ below.

Customers in the past have brought claims against us for the actions of our agents. Even with
proper controls in place, actual or alleged errors or inaccuracies by our agents could result in our
involvement in disputes, litigation or regulatory actions related to actions taken or not taken by our
agents.

We are exposed to, and may face adverse developments involving, mass tort claims such as those

In addition to asbestos and

relating to exposure to potentially harmful products or substances.
environmental claims, we face potential exposure to other types of mass tort claims, including claims
related to exposure to potentially harmful products or substances, such as lead paint, silica, talc and
welding rod fumes. Establishing claims and claim adjustment expense reserves for mass tort claims is
subject to uncertainties because of many factors, including expanded theories of liability, disputes
concerning medical causation with respect to certain diseases, geographical concentration of the
lawsuits asserting the claims and the potential for a large rise in the total number of claims without
underlying epidemiological developments suggesting an increase in disease rates. Moreover, evolving
judicial interpretations regarding the application of various tort theories and defenses, including
application of various theories of joint and several liabilities, as well as the application of insurance
coverage to these claims, make it difficult to estimate our ultimate liability for such claims.

57

Because of the uncertainties set forth above, additional liabilities may arise for amounts in excess
of the current related reserves. In addition, our estimate of claims and claim adjustment expenses may
change, and such change could be material. These additional liabilities or increases in estimates, or a
range of either, cannot now be reasonably estimated and could materially and adversely affect our
results of operations.

The effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain. As industry

practices and legal, judicial, social and other environmental conditions change, unexpected and
unintended issues related to claim and coverage may emerge. These issues may adversely affect our
business, including by extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent, by increasing the number,
size or types of claims or by mandating changes to our underwriting practices. Examples of emerging
claims and coverage issues include, but are not limited to:

(cid:127) judicial expansion of policy coverage and the impact of new or expanded theories of liability;
(cid:127) plaintiffs targeting property and casualty insurers, including us, in purported class action

litigation relating to claims-handling and other practices;

(cid:127) claims relating to construction defects, which often present complex coverage and damage

valuation questions;

(cid:127) claims under directors’ & officers’ and/or errors and omissions insurance policies relating to
losses from involvement in financial market activities, such as mortgage or financial product
origination, distribution, structuring or servicing and foreclosure procedures; failed financial
institutions; fraud; improper sales practices; anti-trust allegations; possible accounting
irregularities; and corporate governance issues;

(cid:127) claims related to data and network security breaches, information system failures or cyber

events, particularly as the ‘‘internet of things’’ becomes more prevalent, including cases where
coverage was not intended to be provided;

(cid:127) the assertion of ‘‘public nuisance’’ or similar theories of liability, pursuant to which plaintiffs

seek to recover monies spent to administer public health care programs, abate hazards to public
health and safety and/or recover damages purportedly attributable to a ‘‘public nuisance’’;

(cid:127) claims related to liability or workers’ compensation arising out of the spread of infectious disease

or pandemic;

(cid:127) claims relating to abuse by an employee or a volunteer of an insured;
(cid:127) claims that link health issues to particular causes (for example, cumulative traumatic head injury

from sports or other causes), resulting in liability or workers’ compensation claims;

(cid:127) claims alleging that one or more of our underwriting criteria have a disparate impact on persons

belonging to a protected class in violation of the law, including the Fair Housing Act;

(cid:127) claims arising out of modern techniques and practices used in connection with the extraction of

natural resources, such as hydraulic fracturing or wastewater injection;

(cid:127) claims arising out of the use of personal cars, homes or other property in commercial

transactions, such as ride or home sharing;

(cid:127) claims relating to unanticipated consequences of current or new technologies or business models

or processes, including as a result of related behavioral changes; and

(cid:127) claims relating to potentially changing climate conditions, including higher frequency and severity

of weather-related events.

58

In some instances, these emerging issues may not become apparent for some time after we have

issued the affected insurance policies. As a result, the full extent of liability under our insurance
policies may not be known for many years after the policies are issued.

In addition, the potential passage of new legislation designed to expand the right to sue, to remove
limitations on recovery, to deem by statute the existence of a covered occurrence, to extend the statutes
of limitations or otherwise to repeal or weaken tort reforms could have an adverse impact on our
business.

The effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are extremely hard

to predict and could harm our business and materially and adversely affect our results of operations.

We may not be able to collect all amounts due to us from reinsurers, reinsurance coverage may
not be available to us in the future at commercially reasonable rates or at all and we are exposed to
credit risk related to our structured settlements. Although the reinsurer is liable to us to the extent
of the ceded reinsurance, we remain liable as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured. As a result,
ceded reinsurance arrangements do not eliminate our obligation to pay claims. Accordingly, we are
subject to credit risk with respect to our ability to recover amounts due from reinsurers.

In the past, certain reinsurers have ceased writing business and entered into runoff. Some of our

reinsurance claims may be disputed by the reinsurers, and we may ultimately receive partial or no
payment. This is a particular risk in the case of claims that relate to insurance policies written many
years ago, including those relating to asbestos and environmental claims. In addition, in a number of
jurisdictions, particularly the European Union and the United Kingdom, a reinsurer is permitted to
transfer a reinsurance arrangement to another reinsurer, which may be less creditworthy, without a
counterparty’s consent, provided that the transfer has been approved by the applicable regulatory
and/or court authority.

Included in reinsurance recoverables are amounts related to certain structured settlements.

Structured settlements are annuities purchased from various life insurance companies to settle certain
personal physical injury claims, of which workers’ compensation claims comprise a significant portion.
In cases where we did not receive a release from the claimant, the structured settlement is included in
reinsurance recoverables and the related claim cost is included in the liability for claims and claim
adjustment expense reserves, as we retain the contingent liability to the claimant. Some of the life
insurance companies from which we have purchased structured settlements have been downgraded to
below investment grade credit ratings subsequent to the time of the purchase. If it is expected that the
life insurance company is not able to pay, we would recognize an impairment of the related reinsurance
recoverable if, and to the extent, the purchased annuities are not covered by state guaranty
associations. In the event that the life insurance company fails to make the required annuity payments,
we would be required to make such payments. For a discussion of our top reinsurance groups by
reinsurance recoverable and the top five groups by amount of structured settlements provided, see
‘‘Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—
Reinsurance Recoverables.’’

The availability and cost of reinsurance are subject to prevailing market conditions, both in terms

of price and available capacity. The availability of reinsurance capacity can be impacted by general
economic conditions and conditions in the reinsurance market, such as the occurrence of significant
reinsured events. The availability and cost of reinsurance could affect our business volume and
profitability. In addition, the Covered Agreement with the European Union recently signed by the U.S.
will eliminate the requirement for European reinsurers operating in the U.S. to provide collateral in
connection with reinsurance agreements, which could make it more difficult for U.S. companies,
including us, to obtain sufficient collateral, if any, in such reinsurance arrangements.

59

Because of the risks set forth above, we may not be able to collect all amounts due to us from

reinsurers, and reinsurance coverage may not be available to us in the future at commercially
reasonable rates or at all, and/or life insurance companies may fail to make required annuity payments,
and thus our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

We are also exposed to credit risk in certain of our insurance operations and with respect to

certain guarantee or indemnification arrangements that we have with third parties.
exposure to credit risk related to our investment portfolio and reinsurance recoverables (discussed
above), we are exposed to credit risk in several other areas of our business operations, including credit
risk relating to policyholders, independent agents and brokers.

In addition to

We are exposed to credit risk in our surety insurance operations, where we guarantee to a third
party that our customer will satisfy certain performance obligations (e.g., a construction contract) or
certain financial obligations, including exposure to large customers who may have obligations to
multiple third parties. If our customer defaults, we may suffer losses and not be reimbursed by that
customer. In addition, it is customary practice in the surety business for multiple insurers to participate
as co-sureties on large surety bonds. Under these arrangements, the co-surety obligations are typically
joint and several, in which case we are also exposed to credit risk with respect to our co-sureties.

In addition, a portion of our business is written with large deductible insurance policies. Under

casualty insurance contracts with deductible features, we are obligated to pay the claimant the full
amount of the settled claim. We are subsequently reimbursed by the contractholder for the deductible
amount, and, as a result, we are exposed to credit risk to the policyholder. Moreover, certain
policyholders purchase retrospectively rated workers’ compensation and/or general liability policies
(i.e., policies in which premiums are adjusted after the policy period based on the actual loss
experience of the policyholder during the policy period). Retrospectively rated policies expose us to
additional credit risk to the extent that the adjusted premium is greater than the original premium.

Our efforts to mitigate the credit risk that we have to our insureds may not be successful. To

reduce such credit risk, we require certain insureds to post collateral for some or all of these
obligations, often in the form of pledged securities such as money market funds or letters of credit
provided by banks, surety bonds or cash. In cases where we receive pledged securities and the insureds
are unable to honor their obligations, we may be exposed to credit risk on the securities pledged and/or
the risk that our access to that collateral may be stayed during an insured’s bankruptcy. In cases where
we receive letters of credit from banks and the insureds are unable to honor their obligations, we are
exposed to the credit risk of the banks that issued the letters of credit.

In accordance with industry practice, when policyholders purchase insurance policies from us

through independent agents and brokers, the premiums relating to those policies are often paid to the
agents and brokers for payment to us. In most jurisdictions, the premiums will be deemed to have been
paid to us whether or not they are actually received by us. Consequently, we assume a degree of credit
risk associated with amounts due from independent agents and brokers.

To a large degree, the credit risk we face is a function of the economy; accordingly, we face an

increased credit risk in an economic downturn. While we attempt to manage the risks discussed above
through underwriting guidelines, collateral requirements and other oversight mechanisms, our efforts
may not be successful. For example, collateral obtained may subsequently have little or no value.
Further, the amount of collateral protection we have been able to obtain on the business we write in
certain markets has decreased, and may continue to decrease, as a result of competition. We are also
exposed to credit risk related to certain guarantee or indemnification arrangements that we have with
third parties. See note 16 of notes to the consolidated financial statements. As a result, our exposure to
the above credit risks could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.

60

Within the United States, our businesses are heavily regulated by the states in which we conduct

business, including licensing, market conduct and financial supervision, and changes in regulation may
reduce our profitability and limit our growth. These regulatory systems are generally designed to
protect the interests of policyholders, and not necessarily the interests of insurers, their shareholders
and other investors. For example, to protect policyholders whose insurance company becomes
financially insolvent, guaranty funds have been established in all 50 states to pay the covered claims of
policyholders in the event of an insolvency of an insurer, subject to applicable state limits. The funding
of guaranty funds is provided through assessments levied against remaining insurers in the marketplace.
As a result, the insolvency of one or more insurance companies could result in additional assessments
levied against us. In addition, many states restrict the timing and/or the ability of an insurer to
discontinue writing a line of business or to cancel or non-renew certain policies.

These regulatory systems also address authorization for lines of business, statutory capital and

surplus requirements, limitations on the types and amounts of certain investments, underwriting
limitations, transactions with affiliates, dividend limitations, changes in control, premium rates and a
variety of other financial and non-financial components of an insurer’s business including, recently,
cyber-security.

The state insurance regulatory framework has been under continuing scrutiny, and some state
legislatures have considered or enacted laws that may alter or increase state authority to regulate
insurance companies and insurance holding companies. Further, the NAIC and state insurance
regulators continually re-examine existing laws and regulations, specifically focusing on modifications to
holding company regulations, interpretations of existing laws and the development of new laws and
regulations.

As part of these changes, insurance holding company regulations were amended to require insurers

who are part of a holding company system to file an enterprise risk report to provide the lead
insurance regulator with a summary of the company’s Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework,
including the material risks within the insurance holding company system that could pose risk to the
insurance entities within the holding company system. Insurers having premium volume above certain
thresholds, including the Company, are also required to perform at least annually a self-assessment of
their current and future risks, including their likely future solvency position (known as an own risk and
solvency assessment or ORSA) and file a confidential report with the insurer’s lead insurance regulator.
The requirement for an insurer to conduct an ORSA is intended to foster an effective level of ERM at
all insurers within a holding company system, and to provide a group-wide perspective on risk and
capital as a supplement to the legal entity view. ORSA is now included in the International Association
of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) standards and is in various stages of implementation in the United
States, Europe, Canada, and other jurisdictions. It is possible that, as a result of ORSA and the manner
in which it may be used by insurance regulators, our states of domicile or other regulatory bodies may
require changes in our ERM process (e.g., prescribe the use of specific models or the application of
certain assumptions in the Company’s models) that have the effect of limiting our ability to write
certain risks, limit our risk appetite to write additional business or reduce our capital management
flexibility. See ‘‘Enterprise Risk Management’’ for further discussion of the Company’s ERM.

The NAIC and state insurance regulators, as well as the Federal Reserve and Federal Insurance
Office, are currently working with the IAIS to develop a global common framework (ComFrame) for
the supervision of internationally active insurance groups (IAIGs). If adopted, ComFrame would
require the designation of a group-wide supervisor (regulator) for each IAIG and would impose a
group capital requirement that would be applied to an IAIG in addition to the current legal entity
capital requirements imposed by state insurance laws and regulations. In response to ComFrame, the
NAIC developed a model law that allows state insurance regulators in the U.S. to be designated as
group-wide supervisors for U.S.-based IAIGs. Additionally, the NAIC is developing a group capital
analytical tool that would be applied to U.S.-based insurance groups in addition to the risk-based

61

capital (RBC) requirement that is applied on a legal entity basis. These regulatory developments could
increase the amount of capital that the Company is required to have and could result in the Company
being subject to increased regulatory requirements.

States may choose to adopt more restrictive insurance laws and regulations that could, among

other things, restrict the ability of insurance subsidiaries to distribute funds to their parent companies
or they could reject rate increases due to the economic environment. The state insurance regulators
may also increase the statutory capital and surplus requirements for our insurance subsidiaries. In
addition, state tax laws that specifically impact the insurance industry, such as premium taxes or other
taxes, could be enacted or changed by states to raise revenues.

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) was signed into law. This is the

first major revision of the U.S. tax code since 1986 and its ultimate impact is uncertain. For example,
some elected state officials and regulators have criticized the new law and may attempt to take legal,
legislative, or regulatory actions designed to change the TCJA’s impact on their jurisdictions.

State laws or regulations that are adopted or amended may be more restrictive than current laws

or regulations and may result in lower revenues and/or higher costs of compliance and thus could
materially and adversely affect our results of operations and limit our growth.

A downgrade in our claims-paying and financial strength ratings could adversely impact our

business volumes, adversely impact our ability to access the capital markets and increase our
borrowing costs. Claims-paying and financial strength ratings are important to an insurer’s competitive
position. Rating agencies periodically review insurers’ ratings and change their ratings criteria;
therefore, our current ratings may not be maintained in the future. A downgrade in one or more of our
ratings could negatively impact our business volumes because demand for certain of our products may
be reduced, particularly because many customers may require that we maintain minimum ratings to
enter into, maintain or renew business with us. Additionally, we may find it more difficult to access the
capital markets and we may incur higher borrowing costs. If significant losses, including, but not limited
to, those resulting from one or more major catastrophes, or significant reserve additions or significant
investment losses were to cause our capital position to deteriorate significantly, or if one or more rating
agencies substantially increase their capital requirements, we may need to raise equity capital in the
future (which we may not be able to do at a reasonable cost or at all, especially at a time of financial
market disruption) in order to maintain our ratings or limit the extent of a downgrade. A continued
trend of more frequent and severe weather-related or other catastrophes or a prolonged financial
market disruption or economic downturn may lead rating agencies to substantially increase their capital
requirements. See also ‘‘During or following a period of financial market disruption or economic
downturn, our business could be materially and adversely affected.’’ For further discussion about our
ratings, see ‘‘Item 1—Business—Ratings.’’

The inability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to our holding company in sufficient

amounts would harm our ability to meet our obligations, pay future shareholder dividends and/or
make future share repurchases. Our holding company relies on dividends from our U.S. insurance
subsidiaries to meet our obligations for payment of interest and principal on outstanding debt, to pay
dividends to shareholders, to make contributions to our qualified domestic pension plan, to pay other
corporate expenses and to make share repurchases. The ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay
dividends to our holding company in the future will depend on their statutory capital and surplus,
earnings and regulatory restrictions.

We are subject to state insurance regulation as an insurance holding company system. Our U.S.

insurance subsidiaries are subject to various regulatory restrictions that limit the maximum amount of
dividends available to be paid to their parent without prior approval of insurance regulatory authorities.
In a time of prolonged economic downturn or otherwise, insurance regulators may choose to further
restrict the ability of insurance subsidiaries to make payments to their parent companies. The ability of

62

our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to our holding company is also restricted by regulations that
set standards of solvency that must be met and maintained.

The inability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to our holding company in an amount

sufficient to meet our debt service obligations and other cash requirements could harm our ability to
meet our obligations, to pay future shareholder dividends and to make share repurchases.

Our efforts to develop new products, expand in targeted markets or improve business processes
and workflows may not be successful and may create enhanced risks. From time to time, to protect
and grow market share and/or improve our efficiency, we invest in strategic initiatives to:

(cid:127) Develop products that insure risks we have not previously insured, contain new coverages or

change coverage terms;

(cid:127) Change commission terms;
(cid:127) Change our underwriting processes;
(cid:127) Improve business processes and workflow to increase efficiencies and productivity and to

enhance the experience of our customers and distributors;

(cid:127) Expand distribution channels; and
(cid:127) Enter geographic markets within or outside of the United States where we have had relatively

little or no market share.

We may not be successful in these efforts, and even if we are successful, they may create the

following risks, among others:

(cid:127) Demand for new products or expansion into new markets may not meet our expectations;
(cid:127) New products and expansion into new markets may change our risk exposures, and the data and

models we use to manage such exposures may not be as effective as those we use in existing
markets or with existing products;

(cid:127) Models underlying automated underwriting and pricing decisions may not be effective;
(cid:127) Efforts to develop new products or markets and to change commission terms may create or
increase distribution channel conflict, such as described above under ‘‘—Disruptions to our
relationships with our independent agents and brokers could adversely affect us;’’

(cid:127) In connection with the conversion of existing policyholders to a new product, some

policyholders’ pricing may increase while the pricing for other policyholders may decrease, the
net impact of which could negatively impact retention and profit margins; and

(cid:127) Changes to our business processes or workflow, including the use of new technologies, may give

rise to execution risk.

These efforts may require us to make substantial expenditures, which may negatively impact results

in the near term, and if not successful, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.

We may be adversely affected if our pricing and capital models provide materially different

indications than actual results. The profitability of our property and casualty business substantially
depends on the extent to which our actual claims experience is consistent with the assumptions we use
in pricing our policies. We utilize proprietary and third party models to help us price business in a
manner that is intended to be consistent, over time, with actual results and return objectives. We
incorporate the Company’s historical loss experience, external industry and other data, and economic
indices into our modeling processes, and we use various methods, including predictive modeling,
forecasting and sophisticated simulation modeling techniques, to analyze loss trends and the risks

63

associated with our assets and liabilities. We also use these modeling processes, analyses and methods
in making underwriting, pricing and reinsurance decisions as part of managing our exposure to
catastrophes and other extreme adverse events. These modeling processes incorporate numerous
assumptions and forecasts about the future level and variability of the frequency and severity of losses,
inflation, interest rates and capital requirements, among others, that are difficult to make and may
differ materially from actual results.

Whether we use a proprietary or third-party model, future experience may be materially different
from past and current experience incorporated in a model’s forecasts or simulations. This includes the
likelihood of events occurring or continuing or the correlation among events. Third-party models may
provide substantially different indications than what our proprietary modeling processes provide. As a
result, third-party model estimates of losses can be, and often have been, materially different for similar
events in comparison to our proprietary estimates. The differences between third-party model estimates
and our proprietary estimates are driven by the use of different data sets as well as different
assumptions and forecasts regarding the frequency and severity of events and claims arising from the
events. In addition, as the number of third-party models increases, it becomes more difficult to validate
and manage such models as they evolve over time, and the risk associated with assimilating the output
from such models into our decisions increases.

If we fail to appropriately price the risks we insure or fail to change our pricing models to

appropriately reflect our experience, or if our claims experience is more frequent or severe than our
underlying risk assumptions, our profit margins may be negatively affected. If we underestimate the
frequency and/or severity of extreme adverse events occurring, our financial condition may be adversely
affected. If we overestimate the risks we are exposed to, we may overprice our products, and new
business growth and retention of our existing business may be adversely affected. See ‘‘Item 7—
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Catastrophe
Modeling.’’

Our business success and profitability depend, in part, on effective information technology systems
and on continuing to develop and implement improvements in technology, particularly as our business
processes become more digital. We depend in large part on our technology systems for conducting
business and processing claims, as well as for providing the data and analytics we utilize to manage our
business. As a result, our business success is dependent on maintaining the effectiveness of existing
technology systems and on continuing to develop and enhance technology systems that support our
business processes and strategic initiatives in a cost and resource efficient manner, particularly as our
business processes become more digital. Some system development projects are long-term in nature,
may negatively impact our expense ratios as we invest in the projects and may cost more than we
expect to complete. In addition, system development projects may not deliver the benefits or perform
as expected, or may be replaced or become obsolete more quickly than expected, which could result in
operational difficulties, additional costs or accelerated recognition of expenses. If we do not effectively
and efficiently manage and upgrade our technology portfolio, or if the costs of doing so are higher than
we expect, our ability to provide competitive services to, and conduct business with, new and existing
customers in a cost effective manner and our ability to implement our strategic initiatives could be
adversely impacted.

If we experience difficulties with technology, data and network security (including as a result of

cyber attacks), outsourcing relationships or cloud-based technology, our ability to conduct our business
could be negatively impacted. While technology can streamline many business processes and
ultimately reduce the cost of operations, technology initiatives present significant risks. Our business is
highly dependent upon our employees’ ability to perform, in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion,
necessary business functions. A shut-down of, or inability to access, one or more of our facilities
(including our primary data processing facility); a power outage; or a failure of one or more of our
information technology, telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair our ability to

64

perform such functions on a timely basis, particularly if such an interruption lasts for an extended
period of time. In the event of a computer virus or disaster such as a natural catastrophe, terrorist or
other attack or industrial accident, our systems could be inaccessible for an extended period of time. In
addition, because our information technology and telecommunications systems increasingly interface
with and depend on third-party systems, including cloud-based, we could experience service denials or
failures of controls if demand for our service exceeds capacity or a third-party system fails or
experiences an interruption. Business interruptions and failures of controls could also result if our
internal systems do not interface with each other as intended or if changes to such systems are not
effectively implemented. Business continuity can also be disrupted by an event, such as a pandemic,
that renders large numbers of a workforce unable to work as needed, particularly at critical locations;
for example, our largest location employs about 20% of our employees. If our business continuity plans
did not sufficiently address a business interruption, system failure or service denial, this could result in
a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business, provide customer service,
pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary business functions.

Our operations rely on the reliable and secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential

and other information in our computer systems and networks. Computer viruses, hackers (including
individuals, organizations or rogue states) and employee or vendor misconduct, and other external
hazards, could expose our data systems to security breaches, cyber-attacks or other disruptions. In
addition, we routinely transmit and receive personal, confidential and proprietary information by e-mail
and other electronic means. While we attempt to develop secure transmission capabilities with third-
party vendors and others with whom we do business, we may be unable to put in place secure
capabilities with all of such vendors and third parties and, in addition, these third parties may not have
appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the information.

Like other global companies, our computer systems are regularly subject to and will continue to be
the target of computer viruses, malware or other malicious codes (including ransomware), unauthorized
access, cyber-attacks or other computer-related penetrations. While we have experienced threats to our
data and systems, to date, we are not aware that we have experienced a material cyber-security breach.
However, over time, the sophistication of these threats continues to increase. Our administrative and
technical controls as well as other preventative actions we take to reduce the risk of cyber incidents and
protect our information may be insufficient to detect or prevent unauthorized access, other physical and
electronic break-ins, cyber-attacks or other security breaches to our computer systems or those of third
parties with whom we do business. In addition, new technology that could result in greater operational
efficiency may further expose our computer systems to the risk of cyber-attacks. Our increased use of
open source software, cloud technology and software as a service can make it more difficult to identify
and remedy such situations due to the disparate location of code utilized in our operations.

We have outsourced certain technology and business process functions to third parties and may

increasingly do so in the future. If we do not effectively develop, implement and monitor our
outsourcing relationships, if third party providers do not perform as anticipated, if we experience
technological or other problems with a transition, or if outsourcing relationships relevant to our
business process functions are terminated, we may not realize expected productivity improvements or
cost efficiencies and may experience operational difficulties, increased costs and a loss of business. Our
outsourcing of certain technology and business process functions to third parties may expose us to
increased risk related to data security, service disruptions or the effectiveness of our control system,
which could result in monetary and reputational damages or harm to our competitive position. These
risks could increase as vendors increasingly offer cloud-based software services rather than software
services which can be run within our data centers. See also ‘‘We could be adversely affected if our
controls designed to ensure compliance with guidelines, policies and legal and regulatory standards are
not effective.’’ In addition to risks caused by third party providers, our ability to receive services from

65

third-party providers outside of the United States might be impacted by cultural differences, political
instability, unanticipated regulatory requirements or public policy inside or outside of the United States.

The increased risks identified above could expose us to data loss or manipulation, disruption of

service, monetary and reputational damages, competitive disadvantage and significant increases in
compliance costs and costs to improve the security and resiliency of our computer systems. The
compromise of personal, confidential or proprietary information could also subject us to legal liability
or regulatory action under evolving cyber-security, data protection and privacy laws and regulations
enacted by the U.S. federal and state governments, Canada, the European Union or other jurisdictions
or by various regulatory organizations or exchanges. As an example, the European General Data
Protection Regulation will be applicable in all European Union member states beginning May 25, 2018.
This regulation adds a broad array of requirements for handling personal data and could impose a fine
of up to 4% of global annual revenue for violations. As a result, our ability to conduct our business
and our results of operations might be materially and adversely affected.

We are also subject to a number of additional risks associated with our business outside the

United States. We conduct business outside the United States primarily in Canada, the United
Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. In addition, we conduct business in Brazil, primarily through a
joint venture, and we have an indirect interest in a joint venture in Colombia. We may also explore
opportunities in other countries, including other Latin American countries and other emerging markets
such as India.

In conducting business outside of the United States, we are also subject to a number of additional
risks, particularly in emerging economies. These risks include restrictions such as price controls, capital
controls, currency exchange limits, ownership limits and other restrictive or anti-competitive
governmental actions or requirements, which could have an adverse effect on our business and our
reputation. A portion of our premiums from outside of the United States is generated in Canada, a
substantial portion of which consists of automobile premiums from the province of Ontario, which is a
highly regulated market. Our business activities outside the United States may also subject us to
currency risk and, in some markets, it may be difficult to effectively hedge that risk, or we may choose
not to hedge that risk. In addition, in some markets, we may invest as part of a joint venture with a
local counterparty. Because our governance rights may be limited, we may not have control over the
ability of the joint venture to make certain decisions and/or mitigate risks it faces, and significant
disagreements with a joint venture counterparty may adversely impact our investment and/or
reputation. Our business activities outside the United States could subject us to increased volatility in
earnings resulting from the need to recognize and subsequently revise a valuation allowance associated
with income taxes if we became unable to fully utilize any deferred tax assets, including loss carry-
forwards from those foreign operations. Also, political instability, particularly in emerging economies,
and changing market conditions around the globe, could result in financial market disruption or an
economic downturn in such regions.

Our business activities outside the United States also subject us to additional domestic and foreign

laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws in other countries
that prohibit the making of improper payments to foreign officials. Although we have policies and
controls in place that are designed to ensure compliance with these laws, if those controls are
ineffective and an employee or intermediary fails to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we
could suffer civil and criminal penalties and our business and our reputation could be adversely
affected. Some countries, particularly emerging economies, have laws and regulations that lack clarity
and, even with local expertise and effective controls, it can be difficult to determine the exact
requirements of, and potential liability under, the local laws. In some jurisdictions, including Brazil,
parties to a joint venture may, in some circumstances, have liability for some obligations of the venture,
and that liability may extend beyond the capital invested. Failure to comply with local laws in a

66

particular market may result in substantial liability and could have a significant and negative effect not
only on our business in that market but also on our reputation generally.

In addition, competition for skilled employees in developing markets and other non-U.S. locations

may be intense. If we are not able to hire, integrate, motivate and retain a sufficient number of
employees with the knowledge and background necessary for our global businesses, those businesses
and our results of operations may be adversely affected.

Regulatory changes outside of the United States, including in Canada, the U.K. and the European

Union, could adversely impact our results of operations and limit our growth.
regulations that are adopted or amended in jurisdictions outside the U.S. may be more restrictive than
current laws or regulations and may result in lower revenues and/or higher costs of compliance and
thus could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and limit our growth.

Insurance laws or

In particular, the European Union’s executive body, the European Commission, implemented new
capital adequacy and risk management regulations called Solvency II on January 1, 2016 that apply to
the Company’s businesses across the European Union. Under Solvency II, it is possible that the U.S.
parent of a European Union subsidiary could be subject to certain Solvency II requirements if the
regulator determines that the subsidiary’s capital position is dependent on the parent company and the
U.S. parent is not already subject to regulations deemed ‘‘equivalent’’ to Solvency II. In addition,
regulators in countries where the Company has operations are working with the International
Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) (and with the NAIC, the Federal Reserve and FIO in the
U.S.) to consider changes to insurance company supervision, including group supervision and group
capital requirements.

The IAIS has developed a methodology for identifying ‘‘global systemically important insurers’’

(G-SIIs) and high level policy measures that will apply to the G-SIIs. The methodology and measures
were endorsed by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) created by the G-20. Using the IAIS
methodology, the FSB, working with national authorities and the IAIS, identified nine insurers in
November 2016 that they designated as G-SIIs. The IAIS is working on the policy measures which
include higher capital requirements and enhanced supervision. The Company has not been designated
as a G-SII by the FSB; however, the FSB updates the list annually, and it is possible that the
methodologies could be amended or interpreted differently in the future and the Company could be
named as a G-SII.

The IAIS is also in the process of developing the Common Framework for the Supervision of

Internationally Active Insurance Groups (ComFrame). As the current draft of ComFrame is completed,
it likely will lead to similar policy measures as those being developed for G-SIIs being made applicable
to internationally active insurance groups (or ‘‘IAIGs’’), including group supervision, group capital
requirements, and resolution planning, i.e., a written plan developed by a financial group detailing how
it would be wound down in the event of an insolvency. The IAIS is currently in the process of field
testing the group capital requirements. The Company would be considered an Internationally Active
Insurance Group under the current Consultation Draft. It is possible that ComFrame, if adopted, could
lead to enhanced supervision and higher capital standards on a global basis if the IAIS, the NAIC and
the individual states adopt the proposed or similar provisions.

The U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative

(USTR) entered into a covered agreement (the Covered Agreement) in September 2017 regarding
prudential (solvency) insurance and reinsurance measures with the European Union (EU). The EU is
expected to approve the agreement later in 2018. The Covered Agreement includes three areas of
prudential insurance supervision related to: reinsurance contracts, group supervision, and the exchange
of information between U.S. and EU insurers and the respective insurance regulators. The Covered
Agreement is intended to promote cooperation between the U.S. and EU insurance regulators and is
intended to limit the ability of the EU to apply solvency and group capital requirements to the

67

worldwide operations of any U.S. insurer operating in the EU. It is possible that individual members of
the EU could choose to apply none or only parts of the Covered Agreement, resulting in greater
regulation and higher capital standards as well as inconsistent regulatory requirements among the
jurisdictions that the Company does business.

While it is not yet known how or if these actions will impact us, such regulation could result in

increased costs of compliance, increased disclosure and less flexibility in our capital management, and
could adversely impact our results of operations and limit our growth.

Loss of or significant restrictions on the use of particular types of underwriting criteria, such as
credit scoring, or other data or methodologies, in the pricing and underwriting of our products could
reduce our future profitability. Our underwriting profitability depends in large part on our ability to
competitively price our products at a level that will adequately compensate us for the risks assumed. As
a result, risk selection and pricing through the application of actuarially sound and segmented
underwriting criteria is critical. However, laws or regulations, or judicial or administrative findings,
could significantly curtail the use of particular types of underwriting criteria. For example, we may use
credit scoring as a factor in pricing decisions where allowed by state law. Some consumer groups and/or
regulators have alleged that the use of credit scoring violates the law by discriminating against persons
belonging to a protected class and are calling for the prohibition or restrictions on the use of credit
scoring in underwriting and pricing. A variety of other underwriting criteria and other data or
methodologies used in personal and commercial insurance have been and continue to be criticized by
regulators, government agencies, consumer groups or individuals on similar or other grounds. Resulting
regulatory actions or litigation could result in negative publicity and/or generate adverse rules or
findings, such as curtailing the use of important underwriting criteria, or other data or methodologies,
each of which could adversely affect our future profitability.

Acquisitions and integration of acquired businesses may result in operating difficulties and other

unintended consequences. From time to time we may pursue acquisition opportunities if we believe
that such opportunities are consistent with our long-term objectives and that the potential rewards of
an acquisition justify the risks. The process of integrating an acquired company or business can be
complex and costly, however, and may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. For
example, acquisitions may present significant risks, including:

(cid:127) the potential disruption of our ongoing business;
(cid:127) the ineffective integration of, or other difficulties with, underwriting, risk management, claims

handling, information technology and actuarial practices;

(cid:127) uncertainties related to an acquiree’s reserve estimates and its design and operation of internal

controls over financial reporting;

(cid:127) the diversion of management time and resources to acquisition integration challenges;
(cid:127) the loss of key employees;
(cid:127) unforeseen liabilities;
(cid:127) difficulties in achieving the strategic objectives of an acquisition, including the business, financial,

technological or distribution objectives;

(cid:127) the cultural challenges associated with integrating employees; and
(cid:127) the impact on our financial position and/or credit ratings.
The expected benefits of acquired businesses may not be realized, any cost savings and other

synergies anticipated from the acquisition may not be achieved and costs associated with the integration
may be greater than anticipated. Acquired businesses may not be successfully integrated, resulting in

68

substantial costs or delays and adversely affecting our ability to compete. Accordingly, our results of
operations might be materially and adversely affected.

We could be adversely affected if our controls designed to ensure compliance with guidelines,

policies and legal and regulatory standards are not effective. Our business is highly dependent on our
ability to engage on a daily basis in a large number of insurance underwriting, claim processing and
investment activities, many of which are highly complex. These activities often are subject to internal
guidelines and policies, as well as legal and regulatory standards. A control system, no matter how well
designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that the control system’s objectives will
be met. If our controls are not effective, it could lead to financial loss, unanticipated risk exposure
(including underwriting, credit and investment risk), errors in financial reporting or damage to our
reputation. See also ‘‘If we experience difficulties with technology, data and network security (including
as a result of cyber attacks), outsourcing relationships, or cloud-based technology, our ability to conduct
our business could be negatively impacted.’’

In addition, ineffective controls, including with respect to any joint ventures or recently acquired
businesses, could lead to litigation or regulatory action. The volume of claims and amount of damages
and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against various types of financial
institutions have increased over time. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us
could have a material adverse financial impact. See note 16 of notes to our consolidated financial
statements for a discussion of certain legal proceedings in which we are involved.

Our businesses may be adversely affected if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees.

There is significant competition from within the property and casualty insurance industry and from
businesses outside the industry for qualified employees, especially those in key positions and those
possessing highly specialized knowledge in areas such as underwriting, data and analytics, technology
and e-commerce. Our performance is largely dependent on the talents, efforts and proper conduct of
highly-skilled individuals, including our senior executives (many of whom have decades of experience in
the insurance industry), and the Board of Directors regularly engages in succession discussions. See
‘‘Item 10—Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance’’ for more information relating to
our executive officers, including our senior leaders. For many of our senior positions, we compete for
talent not just with insurance or financial service companies, but with other large companies and other
businesses. Our continued ability to compete effectively in our businesses and to expand into new
business areas depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing
employees. If we are not able to successfully attract, retain and motivate our employees, our business,
financial results and reputation could be materially and adversely affected.

Intellectual property is important to our business, and we may be unable to protect and enforce

our own intellectual property or we may be subject to claims for infringing the intellectual property of
others. Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our proprietary trademarks,
technology and other intellectual property. See ‘‘Item 1—Other Information—Intellectual Property.’’
We may not, however, be able to protect our intellectual property from unauthorized use and
disclosure by others. Further, the intellectual property laws may not prevent our competitors from
independently developing trademarks, products and services that are similar to ours. Moreover, the
agreements we execute to protect our intellectual property rights may be breached, and we may not
have adequate remedies in response. Our attempts to patent or register our intellectual property rights
in the U.S. and worldwide may not succeed initially or may later be challenged by third parties.
Further, the laws of certain countries outside the United States may not adequately protect our
intellectual property rights. We may incur significant costs in our efforts to protect and enforce our
intellectual property, including the initiation of expensive and protracted litigation, and we may not
prevail. Any inability to enforce our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on
our business and our ability to compete.

69

We may be subject to claims by third parties from time to time that our products, services and

technologies infringe on their intellectual property rights. In recent years, certain entities have acquired
patents in order to allege claims of infringement against companies, including in some cases, us. Any
intellectual property infringement claims brought against us could cause us to spend significant time
and money to defend ourselves, regardless of the merits of the claims. If we are found to infringe any
third-party intellectual property rights, it could result in reputational harm, payment of significant
monetary damages, payment of license fees (if licenses are even available to us, on reasonable terms or
otherwise) and/or substantial time and expense to redesign our products, services or technologies to
avoid the infringement. In addition, we use third party software in some of our products, services and
technologies. If any of our software vendors or licensors are faced with infringement claims, we may
lose our ability to use such software until the dispute is resolved. If we cannot successfully redesign an
infringing product, service or technology (or procure a substitute version), this could have a material
adverse effect on our business and our ability to compete.

Changes in federal regulation could impose significant burdens on us and otherwise adversely

impact our results. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the
Dodd-Frank Act) established a Federal Insurance Office (FIO) within the U.S. Department of the
Treasury. The FIO has limited regulatory authority and is empowered to gather data and information
regarding the insurance industry and insurers, but it has in the past recommended an expanded federal
role in some circumstances. The Dodd-Frank Act also gives the Federal Reserve supervisory authority
over a number of nonbank financial services holding companies, including insurance companies, if they
are designated by a two-thirds vote of a Financial Stability Oversight Council (the FSOC) as
‘‘systemically important financial institutions’’ (SIFI) or own a bank or thrift. The Company, based
upon the FSOC’s rules and interpretive guidance, has not been designated as a SIFI and is not subject
to regulation by the Federal Reserve. In addition, the Federal Reserve appears to be moving away from
SIFI designations altogether. Nonetheless, it is possible that FSOC may change its rules or
interpretations in the future and conclude that we are a SIFI. If we were designated as a SIFI, the
Federal Reserve’s supervisory authority could include the ability to impose heightened financial
regulation and could impact requirements regarding our capital, liquidity and leverage as well as our
business and investment conduct. The Dodd-Frank Act also authorizes assessments to pay for the
resolution of SIFI’s that have become insolvent. We (as a financial company with more than $50 billion
in assets) could be assessed, and although any such assessment is required to be risk weighted
(i.e., riskier firms pay more), such costs could be material to us and are not currently estimable. As a
result of the foregoing, the Dodd-Frank Act, including any changes thereto as a result of its current
re-evaluation or otherwise, or other additional federal regulation that is adopted in the future, could
impose additional burdens on us, including impacting the ways in which we conduct our business,
increasing compliance costs and duplicating state regulation, and could result in a competitive
disadvantage, particularly relative to other competitors that may not be subject to the same level of
regulation.

Even if we are not subject to additional regulation by the federal government, significant financial

sector regulatory reform could have a significant impact on us. For example, regulatory reform could
have an unexpected impact on our rights as a creditor or on our competitive position. The current
administration is reviewing rules and regulations across the entire federal regulatory spectrum,
including Treasury, the SEC, the Department of Transportation, the Department of Labor and other
agencies, as well as treaty relationships with parties to the North American Free Trade Agreement. We
expect executive action on regulatory changes to continue in 2018 and beyond.

Other potential changes in U.S. federal legislation, regulation and/or administrative policies,

including the potential repeal of the McCarran-Ferguson Act (which exempts insurance from most
federal regulation), could also significantly harm the insurance industry, including us.

70

Changes in U.S. tax laws or in the tax laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate could

adversely impact us. Tax laws may change in ways that adversely impact us, including increasing the
statutory U.S. federal corporate income tax rate. Alternatively, federal tax legislation could be enacted
to further reduce the existing statutory U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 21%, which would,
accordingly, reduce any U.S. net deferred tax asset. The amount of any net deferred tax asset is volatile
and significantly impacted by changes in unrealized investment gains and losses. The effect of a
reduction in a tax rate on net deferred tax assets is required to be recognized, in full, as a reduction of
income from continuing operations in the period when enacted and, along with other changes in the
tax rules that may increase the Company’s actual tax expense, could materially and adversely affect our
results of operations. In addition, a reduction in the existing statutory U.S. federal corporate income
tax rate could increase the after-tax effect of future significant loss events and our after-tax borrowing
costs. Additional uncertainties exist with respect to potential technical corrections and clarifications to
the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.

Our investment portfolio has benefited from certain tax exemptions and certain other tax laws and
regulations, including, but not limited to, those governing dividends-received deductions and tax credits.
Federal and/or state tax legislation could be enacted in connection with deficit reduction or various
types of fundamental tax reform that would lessen or eliminate some or all of the tax advantages
currently benefiting us and therefore could materially and adversely impact our results of operations. In
addition, such legislation could adversely affect the value of our investment portfolio, particularly
changes to the taxation of interest from municipal bonds (which comprise 43% of our investment
portfolio as of December 31, 2017), which could materially and adversely impact the value of those
bonds.

Other tax law changes could materially and adversely impact our results of operations. For

example, budget constraints faced by many states and localities increase the likelihood that state and
local governments will raise revenue by enacting legislation increasing the taxes paid by individuals and
corporations.

(1) The cumulative return to shareholders is a concept used to compare the performance of a

company’s stock over time and is the ratio of the net stock price change plus the cumulative
amount of dividends over the specified time period (assuming dividend reinvestment) to the stock
price at the beginning of the time period.

(2) Assumes $100 invested in common shares of The Travelers Companies, Inc. on December 31,

2012.

(3) Companies in the S&P 500 Property & Casualty Insurance Index as of December 31, 2017 were
the following: The Travelers Companies, Inc., Chubb Limited, Cincinnati Financial Corporation,
The Progressive Corporation, The Allstate Corporation and XL Group Ltd.
Returns of each of the companies included in this index have been weighted according to their
respective market capitalizations.
A long-term perspective is particularly important in the property and casualty insurance industry,
where the periodic occurrences of significant catastrophes have historically produced results that
can vary significantly year-to-year. Accordingly, management manages with a long-term perspective.
For the ten-year period ended December 31, 2017, the Company’s cumulative return to
shareholders was 224% as compared to 126% for the S&P 500 Index and 157% for the S&P 500
Property & Casualty Insurance Index.

The Company’s Board of Directors has approved common share repurchase authorizations under

which repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market, pursuant to pre-set trading
plans meeting the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, in private
transactions or otherwise. The authorizations do not have a stated expiration date. The timing and
actual number of shares to be repurchased in the future will depend on a variety of factors, including
the Company’s financial position, earnings, share price, catastrophe losses, maintaining capital levels
commensurate with the Company’s desired ratings from independent rating agencies, funding of the
Company’s qualified pension plan, capital requirements of the Company’s operating subsidiaries, legal
requirements, regulatory constraints, other investment opportunities (including mergers and acquisitions
and related financings), market conditions and other factors.

The Company acquired 5,998 shares for a total cost of approximately $0.8 million during the three

months ended December 31, 2017 that were not part of the publicly announced share repurchase
authorization. These shares consisted of shares retained to cover payroll withholding taxes in
connection with the vesting of restricted stock unit awards and performance share awards, and shares
used by employees to cover the price of certain stock options that were exercised.

For additional information regarding the Company’s share repurchases, see ‘‘Item 7—

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity
and Capital Resources.’’

Information relating to compensation plans under which the Company’s equity securities are

authorized for issuance is set forth in Part III—Item 12 of this Report.

Realignment of Reportable Business Segments

Effective April 1, 2017, the Company’s results are reported in the following three business

segments—Business Insurance, Bond & Specialty Insurance and Personal Insurance, reflecting a change
in the manner in which the Company’s businesses were being managed as of that date, as well as the
aggregation of products and services based on the type of customer, how the business is marketed and
the manner in which risks are underwritten. While the segmentation of the Company’s domestic
businesses was unchanged, the Company’s international businesses, which were previously managed and
reported in total within the Business and International Insurance segment, were disaggregated by
product type among the three newly aligned reportable business segments. All prior periods presented
have been reclassified to conform to this presentation. In connection with these changes, the Company
revised the names and descriptions of certain businesses comprising the Company’s segments and has
reflected other related changes. The following discussion of segment results is based on the realigned
reportable business segment structure effective April 1, 2017.

The following discussions of the Company’s net income and segment income are presented on an
after-tax basis. Discussions of the components of net income and segment income are presented on a
pre-tax basis, unless otherwise noted. Discussions of earnings per common share are presented on a
diluted basis.

Overview

Diluted net income per share of $7.33 in 2017 decreased by 29% from diluted net income per
share of $10.28 in 2016. Net income of $2.06 billion in 2017 decreased by 32% from net income of
$3.01 billion in 2016. The lower rate of decrease in diluted net income per share reflected the impact
of share repurchases in recent periods. The decrease in net income primarily reflected the pre-tax
impacts of (i) significantly higher catastrophe losses, (ii) lower net favorable prior year reserve
development, (iii) lower underwriting margins excluding catastrophe losses and prior year reserve
development (‘‘underlying underwriting margins’’) and (iv) lower other income in 2017 due to a
favorable settlement of a reinsurance dispute in 2016, partially offset by (v) higher net realized
investment gains and (vi) higher net investment income. Catastrophe losses in 2017 and 2016 were
$1.95 billion and $877 million, respectively. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2017 and
2016 was $592 million and $771 million, respectively. The lower underlying underwriting margins
primarily resulted from the impacts of (i) loss cost trends that modestly exceeded earned pricing in

77

Business Insurance, (ii) higher non-catastrophe fire-related losses in Business Insurance and (iii) higher
non-catastrophe weather-related losses in Personal Insurance, partially offset by (iv) increased business
volumes. Partially offsetting this net pre-tax decrease in income was a related decrease in income tax
expense. Income tax expense also included a net charge of $129 million to reflect the change in tax
laws and tax rates enacted in the U.S. on December 22, 2017 as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
of 2017 (TCJA), resulting primarily from revaluing the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities and
the tax imposed on accumulated foreign earnings. In addition, income tax expense in 2017 was reduced
by $39 million as a result of the resolution of prior year tax matters.

Diluted net income per share of $10.28 in 2016 decreased by 6% from diluted net income per
share of $10.88 in 2015. Net income of $3.01 billion in 2016 decreased by 12% from net income of
$3.44 billion in 2015. The lower rate of decrease in diluted net income per share reflected the impact
of share repurchases in recent periods. The decrease in net income primarily reflected the pre-tax
impacts of (i) higher catastrophe losses, (ii) lower underlying underwriting margins, (iii) lower net
favorable prior year reserve development and (iv) lower net investment income, partially offset by
(v) higher other revenues and (vi) higher net realized investment gains. Catastrophe losses in 2016 and
2015 were $877 million and $514 million, respectively. Net favorable prior year reserve development in
2016 and 2015 was $771 million and $941 million, respectively. The lower underlying underwriting
margins primarily resulted from (i) higher loss estimates in the personal automobile product line for
bodily injury liability coverages, (ii) the impact of loss cost trends that modestly exceeded earned
pricing in Business Insurance and (iii) higher general and administrative expenses, partially offset by
(iv) lower non-catastrophe fire-related losses and other loss activity in Business Insurance. Partially
offsetting this net pre-tax decrease in income was a related decrease in income tax expense. Income tax
expense in 2015 was also reduced by $32 million as a result of the resolution of prior year tax matters.
The Company has insurance operations in Canada, the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland

and throughout other parts of the world as a corporate member of Lloyd’s, as well as in Brazil and
Colombia, primarily through joint ventures. Because these operations are conducted in local currencies
other than the U.S. dollar, the Company is subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. For
the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, changes in foreign currency exchange rates
impacted reported line items in the statement of income by insignificant amounts. The impact of these
changes was not material to the Company’s net income or segment income for the periods reported.

Revenues

Earned Premiums

Earned premiums in 2017 were $25.68 billion, $1.15 billion or 5% higher than in 2016. In Business

Insurance, earned premiums in 2017 increased by 2% over 2016. In Bond & Specialty Insurance,
earned premiums in 2017 increased by 2% over 2016. In Personal Insurance, earned premiums in 2017
increased by 10% over 2016. Earned premiums in 2016 were $24.53 billion, $660 million or 3% higher
than in 2015. In Business Insurance, earned premiums in 2016 increased by 1% over 2015. In Bond &
Specialty Insurance, earned premiums in 2016 were comparable to 2015. In Personal Insurance, earned
premiums in 2016 increased by 6% over 2015. Factors contributing to the changes in earned premiums
in each segment in 2017 and 2016 compared with the respective prior year are discussed in more detail
in the segment discussions that follow.

(2) Excludes net realized and net unrealized investment gains and losses.

Net investment income in 2017 was $2.40 billion, $95 million or 4% higher than in 2016. Net

investment income from fixed maturity investments in 2017 was $1.89 billion, $86 million lower than in
2016. The decrease primarily resulted from lower long-term reinvestment rates available in the market,
partially offset by the impact of a slightly higher average level of fixed maturity investments. Net
investment income from short-term securities in 2017 was $62 million, $33 million higher than in 2016,
primarily due to higher short-term interest rates and a higher average level of short-term investments.
Net investment income generated by non-fixed maturity investments in 2017 was $478 million,
$148 million higher than in 2016, primarily due to higher returns from private equity limited
partnerships.

Net investment income in 2016 was $2.30 billion, $77 million or 3% lower than in 2015. Net

investment income from fixed maturity investments in 2016 was $1.98 billion, $110 million lower than in
2015. The decrease in net investment income from fixed maturity investments primarily resulted from
lower long-term reinvestment rates available in the market and a modestly lower amount of fixed
income investments that were impacted by the Company’s $524 million payment related to the
settlement of the PPG Industries, Inc. litigation in the second quarter of 2016. Net investment income
from short-term securities in 2016 was $29 million, $17 million higher than in 2015, primarily due to
higher short-term interest rates. Net investment income generated by non-fixed maturity investments in
2016 was $330 million, $13 million higher than in 2015, primarily due to higher returns from private
equity limited partnerships, partially offset by lower returns from real estate partnerships.

Fee Income

The National Accounts market in Business Insurance is the primary source of the Company’s

fee-based business. Fee income is described in more detail in the Business Insurance discussion that
follows.

Other Net Realized Investment Gains

Other net realized investment gains in 2017 included $236 million of net realized investment gains

related to equity securities, $10 million of net realized investment gains from real estate sales,
$4 million of net realized gains related to fixed maturity investments and $20 million of net realized
investment losses related to other investments.

Other net realized investment gains in 2016 included $59 million of net realized gains related to

fixed maturity investments, $14 million of net realized investment gains related to equity securities,
$7 million of net realized investment gains from real estate sales and $17 million of net realized
investment gains related to other investments.

Other net realized investment gains in 2015 included $81 million of net realized gains related to

fixed maturity investments, $6 million of net realized investment gains related to equity securities,
$2 million of net realized investment gains from real estate sales and $34 million of net realized
investment losses related to other investments. The net realized investment losses related to other
investments included $26 million of realized foreign exchange translation losses incurred in connection
with the Company’s increased ownership of Travelers Participa¸c˜oes em Seguros Brasil S.A.

Other Revenues

Other revenues in all years presented included installment premium charges. Other revenues in

2017 also included revenues from Simply Business, which was acquired in August 2017. Other revenues
in 2017 and 2016 also included gains related to the settlement of reinsurance disputes (discussed in
more detail in note 16 of notes to the consolidated financial statements). Other revenues in 2016 also
included proceeds from the favorable settlement of a claims-related legal matter.

Claims and Expenses

Claims and Claim Adjustment Expenses

Claims and claim adjustment expenses in 2017 were $17.47 billion, $2.40 billion or 16% higher
than in 2016, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) significantly higher catastrophe losses, (ii) higher
volumes of insured exposures, (iii) loss cost trends, (iv) lower net favorable prior year reserve
development, (v) higher non-catastrophe fire-related losses in Business Insurance and (vi) higher
non-catastrophe weather-related losses in Personal Insurance. Catastrophe losses in 2017 primarily
resulted from wildfires in California, Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, and several winter, wind and
hail storms throughout the United States.

Claims and claim adjustment expenses in 2016 were $15.07 billion, $1.35 billion or 10% higher

than in 2015, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) higher volumes of insured exposures, (ii) loss cost
trends, (iii) higher catastrophe losses, (iv) lower net favorable prior year reserve development and
(v) higher loss estimates in the personal automobile product line for bodily injury liability coverages,
partially offset by (vi) lower non-catastrophe fire-related losses and other loss activity in Business
Insurance. Catastrophe losses in 2016 primarily resulted from Hurricane Matthew, wind and hail storms
in several regions of the United States, flooding in the Southeast region of the United States, wildfires
in Canada and Tennessee, and winter storms in the eastern United States. Catastrophe losses in 2015
primarily resulted from wildfires in California, and several winter, wind and hail storms throughout the
United States.

Factors contributing to net favorable prior year reserve development during the years ended

December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 are discussed in more detail in note 7 of notes to the consolidated
financial statements.

80

Significant Catastrophe Losses

The Company defines a ‘‘catastrophe’’ as an event that:
(cid:127) is designated a catastrophe by internationally recognized organizations that track and report on

insured losses resulting from catastrophic events, such as Property Claim Services (PCS) for
events in the United States and Canada; and

(cid:127) the Company’s estimates of its ultimate losses before reinsurance and taxes exceed a

pre-established dollar threshold.

The Company’s threshold for disclosing catastrophes is primarily determined at the reportable
segment level. If a threshold for one segment or a combination thereof is exceeded and the other
segments have losses from the same event, losses from the event are identified as catastrophe losses in
the segment results and for the consolidated results of the Company. Additionally, an aggregate
threshold is applied for International business across all reportable segments. The threshold for 2017
ranged from approximately $17 million to $30 million of losses before reinsurance and taxes.

The following table presents the amount of losses recorded by the Company for significant

catastrophes that occurred in 2017, 2016 and 2015, the amount of net unfavorable (favorable) prior
year reserve development recognized in 2017 and 2016 for catastrophes that occurred in 2016 and 2015,
and the estimate of ultimate losses for those catastrophes at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. For
purposes of the table, a significant catastrophe is an event for which the Company estimates its
ultimate losses will be $100 million or more after reinsurance and before taxes.

Amortization of Deferred Acquisition Costs

Amortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2017 was $4.17 billion, $181 million or 5% higher

than in 2016. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2016 was $3.99 billion, $100 million or
3% higher than in 2015. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs is discussed in more detail in the
segment discussions that follow.

General and Administrative Expenses

General and administrative expenses in 2017 were $4.17 billion, comparable with 2016. General

and administrative expenses in 2016 were $4.15 billion, $60 million or 1% higher than in 2015. General
and administrative expenses are discussed in more detail in the segment discussions that follow.

Interest Expense

Interest expense in 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $369 million, $363 million and $373 million,

respectively.

Income Tax Expense

Income tax expense in 2017 was $674 million, $365 million or 35% lower than in 2016, primarily

reflecting the impact of the $1.32 billion decrease in income before income taxes in 2017 and the
$39 million reduction in income tax expense resulting from the resolution of prior year tax matters,
partially offset by the net charge of $129 million as part of the TCJA described above. Income tax
expense in 2016 was $1.04 billion, $262 million or 20% lower than in 2015, primarily reflecting the
impact of the $687 million decrease in income before income taxes in 2016.

The Company’s effective tax rate was 25%, 26% and 27% in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

The effective tax rates in all years were lower than the statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the
impact of tax-exempt investment income on the calculation of the Company’s income tax provision. In
addition, the effective tax rate in 2017 was increased by the net charge related to TCJA described
above and was reduced by the impact of the resolution of prior year tax matters discussed above.

Combined Ratio

The combined ratio of 97.9% in 2017 was 5.9 points higher than the combined ratio of 92.0% in

2016.

The loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 67.2% in 2017 was 6.7 points higher than the loss
and loss adjustment expense ratio of 60.5% in 2016. Catastrophe losses accounted for 7.6 points and
3.6 points of the 2017 and 2016 loss and loss adjustment expense ratios, respectively. Net favorable
prior year reserve development in 2017 and 2016 provided 2.3 points and 3.2 points of benefit,
respectively, to the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio. The loss and loss adjustment expense ratio
excluding catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development (‘‘underlying loss and loss adjustment
expense ratio’’) in 2017 was 1.8 points higher than the 2016 ratio on the same basis, primarily reflecting
(i) loss cost trends that modestly exceeded earned pricing in Business Insurance, (ii) higher
non-catastrophe fire-related losses in Business Insurance and (iii) higher non-catastrophe weather-
related losses in Personal Insurance.

The underwriting expense ratio of 30.7% in 2017 was 0.8 points lower than the underwriting

expense ratio of 31.5% in 2016.

The combined ratio of 92.0% in 2016 was 3.7 points higher than the combined ratio of 88.3% in

2015.

The loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 60.5% in 2016 was 3.9 points higher than the loss
and loss adjustment expense ratio of 56.6% in the same period of 2015. Catastrophe losses accounted
for 3.6 points and 2.1 points of the 2016 and 2015 loss and loss adjustment expense ratios, respectively.
Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2016 and 2015 provided 3.2 points and 3.9 points of
benefit, respectively, to the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio. The underlying loss and loss
adjustment expense ratio in 2016 was 1.7 points higher than the 2015 ratio on the same basis, primarily
reflecting (i) higher loss estimates in the personal automobile product line for bodily injury liability

82

coverages and (ii) the impact of loss cost trends that modestly exceeded earned pricing in Business
Insurance, partially offset by (iii) lower non-catastrophe fire-related losses and other loss activity in
Business Insurance.

The underwriting expense ratio of 31.5% was 0.2 points lower than the underwriting expense ratio

of 31.7% in 2015.

Overview

Segment income in 2017 was $1.61 billion, $369 million or 19% lower than segment income of
$1.98 billion in 2016, primarily reflecting the pre-tax impacts of (i) significantly higher catastrophe
losses, (ii) lower other income due to a favorable settlement of a reinsurance dispute in 2016 and
(iii) lower underlying underwriting margins, partially offset by (iv) higher net investment income.
Catastrophe losses in 2017 and 2016 were $858 million and $463 million, respectively. Net favorable
prior year reserve development in 2017 and 2016 was $439 million and $424 million, respectively. The
lower underlying underwriting margins primarily resulted from the impacts of (i) loss cost trends that
modestly exceeded earned pricing and (ii) higher non-catastrophe fire-related losses. Partially offsetting
this net pre-tax decrease in segment income was a related decrease in income tax expense. In addition,
income tax expense in 2017 was reduced by $15 million as a result of the resolution of prior year tax
matters.

Segment income in 2016 was $1.98 billion, $95 million or 5% lower than segment income of

$2.08 billion in 2015, primarily reflecting the pre-tax impacts of (i) higher catastrophe losses, (ii) lower
underlying underwriting margins and (iii) lower net investment income, partially offset by (iv) higher
other revenues and (v) higher net favorable prior year reserve development. Catastrophe losses in 2016
and 2015 were $463 million and $245 million, respectively. Net favorable prior year reserve
development in 2016 and 2015 was $424 million and $332 million, respectively. The lower underlying
underwriting margins primarily resulted from (i) the impact of loss cost trends that modestly exceeded
earned pricing and (ii) higher general and administrative expenses, partially offset by (iii) lower
non-catastrophe fire-related losses and other loss activity. Partially offsetting this net pre-tax decrease in
segment income was a related decrease in income tax expense.

Revenues

Earned Premiums

Earned premiums of $14.15 billion in 2017 were $291 million or 2% higher than in 2016. Earned

premiums of $13.86 billion in 2016 were $157 million or 1% higher than in 2015. The increase in
earned premiums in both 2017 and 2016 reflected increases in net written premiums over the preceding
twelve months.

Net Investment Income

Net investment income in 2017 was $1.79 billion, $85 million or 5% higher than in 2016. Net

investment income in 2016 was $1.70 billion, $56 million or 3% lower than in 2015. Refer to the ‘‘Net
Investment Income’’ section of the ‘‘Consolidated Results of Operations’’ discussion for a description of
the factors contributing to the changes in the Company’s consolidated net investment income in 2017
and 2016 compared with the respective prior years. In addition, refer to note 2 of notes to the
consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the Company’s net investment income allocation
methodology.

Fee Income

National Accounts is the primary source of fee income due to its service businesses, which include

claim and loss prevention services to large companies that choose to self-insure a portion of their
insurance risks, as well as claims and policy management services to workers’ compensation residual
market pools. Fee income in 2017 was $430 million, $12 million or 3% lower than in 2016, primarily
reflecting lower serviced premium volume due to the depopulation of workers’ compensation residual
market pools. Fee income in 2016 was $442 million, $3 million or 1% lower than in 2015.

84

Other Revenues

Other revenues in all years presented included installment premium charges. Other revenues in
2017 included revenues from Simply Business, which was acquired in August 2017. Other revenues in
2017 and 2016 also included gains related to the settlement of reinsurance disputes. Additionally, other
revenues in 2016 included proceeds from the favorable settlement of a claims-related legal matter.

Claims and Expenses

Claims and Claim Adjustment Expenses

Claims and claim adjustment expenses in 2017 were $9.52 billion, $768 million or 9% higher than

in 2016, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) significantly higher catastrophe losses, (ii) loss cost
trends, (iii) higher volumes of insured exposures and (iv) higher non-catastrophe fire-related losses.
Claims and claim adjustment expenses in 2016 were $8.75 billion, $344 million or 4% higher than in
2015, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) loss cost trends and (ii) higher catastrophe losses, partially
offset by (iii) lower non-catastrophe fire-related losses and other loss activity.

Factors contributing to net favorable prior year reserve development during the years ended

December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 are discussed in more detail in note 7 of notes to the consolidated
financial statements.

Amortization of Deferred Acquisition Costs

Amortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2017 was $2.29 billion, $65 million or 3% higher than
in 2016. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2016 was $2.22 billion, $39 million or 2% higher
than in 2015. The increases in both 2017 and 2016 were generally consistent with the increases in
earned premiums.

General and Administrative Expenses

General and administrative expenses in 2017 were $2.56 billion, which were comparable with 2016.
General and administrative expenses in 2016 were $2.55 billion, $49 million or 2% higher than in 2015,
primarily reflecting higher employee and technology related expenses.

Income Tax Expense

Income tax expense in 2017 was $448 million, $208 million or 32% lower than in 2016, primarily

reflecting the impact of the $577 million decrease in income before income taxes in 2017 and the
$15 million reduction in income tax expense resulting from the resolution of prior year tax matters.
Income tax expense in 2016 was $656 million, $88 million or 12% lower than in 2015, primarily
reflecting the $183 million decrease in income before income taxes in 2016.

Combined Ratio

The combined ratio of 97.8% in 2017 was 3.7 points higher than the combined ratio of 94.1% in

2016.

The loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 65.9% in 2017 was 4.2 points higher than the loss

and loss adjustment expense ratio of 61.7% in 2016. Catastrophe losses in 2017 and 2016 accounted for
6.0 points and 3.4 points of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio, respectively. Net favorable prior
year reserve development provided 3.1 points of benefit to the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in
both 2017 and 2016. The underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in 2017 was 1.6 points
higher than the 2016 ratio on the same basis, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) loss cost trends that
modestly exceeded earned pricing and (ii) higher non-catastrophe fire-related losses.

85

The underwriting expense ratio of 31.9% in 2017 was 0.5 points lower than the underwriting

expense ratio of 32.4% in 2016.

The combined ratio of 94.1% in 2016 was 2.1 points higher than the combined ratio of 92.0% in

2015.

The loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 61.7% in 2016 was 1.8 points higher than the loss

and loss adjustment expense ratio of 59.9% in 2015. Catastrophe losses in 2016 and 2015 accounted for
3.4 points and 1.8 points, respectively, of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio. Net favorable prior
year reserve development in 2016 and 2015 provided 3.1 points and 2.4 points of benefit, respectively,
to the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio. The underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in
2016 was 0.9 points higher than the 2015 ratio on the same basis.

Overview

Segment income in 2017 was $556 million, $156 million or 22% lower than segment income of

$712 million in 2016, primarily reflecting the pre-tax impacts of (i) lower net favorable prior year
reserve development and (ii) lower underlying underwriting margins. Net favorable prior year reserve

87

development in 2017 and 2016 was $140 million and $350 million, respectively. Catastrophe losses in
both 2017 and 2016 were $6 million. The lower underlying underwriting margins primarily reflected a
higher level of international surety losses. Partially offsetting this net pre-tax decrease in segment
income was a related decrease in income tax expense. In addition, income tax expense in 2017 was
reduced by $17 million as a result of the resolution of prior year tax matters.

Segment income in 2016 was $712 million, $29 million or 4% higher than segment income of
$683 million in 2015, primarily reflecting the pre-tax impact of (i) higher net favorable prior year
reserve development, partially offset by (ii) lower net investment income. Net favorable prior year
reserve development in 2016 and 2015 was $350 million and $281 million, respectively. Catastrophe
losses in 2016 and 2015 were $6 million and $3 million, respectively. Partially offsetting this net pre-tax
increase in segment income was a related increase in income tax expense.

Revenues

Earned Premiums

Earned premiums in 2017 were $2.31 billion, $47 million or 2% higher than in 2016, primarily

reflecting an increase in net written premiums over the preceding twelve months. Earned premiums of
$2.26 billion in 2016 were comparable with 2015.

Net Investment Income

Net investment income in 2017 was $228 million, $11 million or 5% lower than in 2016. Net
investment income in 2016 was $239 million, $15 million or 6% lower than in 2015. Included in
Bond & Specialty Insurance are certain legal entities whose invested assets and related net investment
income are reported exclusively in this segment and not allocated among all business segments. As a
result, reported net investment income in Bond & Specialty Insurance reflects a significantly smaller
proportion of allocated net investment income, including that from the Company’s non-fixed maturity
investments that experienced an increase in investment income in 2017 and 2016. Refer to the ‘‘Net
Investment Income’’ section of the ‘‘Consolidated Results of Operations’’ discussion for a description of
the factors contributing to the changes in the Company’s consolidated net investment income in 2017
and 2016 compared with the respective prior years. In addition, refer to note 2 of notes to the
consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the Company’s net investment income allocation
methodology.

Claims and Expenses

Claims and Claim Adjustment Expenses

Claims and claim adjustment expenses in 2017 were $899 million, $266 million or 42% higher than

in 2016, primarily reflecting (i) lower net favorable prior year reserve development and (ii) a higher
level of international surety losses. Claims and claim adjustment expenses in 2016 were $633 million,
$86 million or 12% lower than in 2015, primarily reflecting higher net favorable prior year reserve
development.

Factors contributing to net favorable prior year reserve development during the years ended

December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 are discussed in more detail in note 7 of notes to the consolidated
financial statements.

Amortization of Deferred Acquisition Costs

Amortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2017 was $432 million, $11 million or 3% higher than

in 2016, generally consistent with the increase in earned premiums. Amortization of deferred
acquisition costs in 2016 was $421 million, $3 million or 1% higher than in 2015.

88

General and Administrative Expenses

General and administrative expenses in 2017 were $464 million, $19 million or 4% higher than in

2016, primarily reflecting higher employee and technology related expenses. General and administrative
expenses in 2016 were $445 million, $5 million or 1% higher than in 2015.

Income Tax Expense

Income tax expense in 2017 was $208 million, $101 million or 33% lower than in 2016, primarily

reflecting the impact of the $257 million decrease in income before income taxes in 2017 and the
$17 million reduction in income tax expense resulting from the resolution of prior year tax matters.
Income tax expense in 2016 was $309 million, $26 million or 9% higher than in 2015, primarily
reflecting the impact of the $55 million increase in income before income taxes in 2016.

Combined Ratio

The combined ratio of 77.4% in 2017 was 11.7 points higher than the combined ratio of 65.7% in

2016.

The loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 38.6% in 2017 was 11.2 points higher than the loss
and loss adjustment expense ratio of 27.4% in 2016. Net favorable prior year reserve development in
2017 and 2016 provided 6.1 points and 15.5 points of benefit, respectively, to the loss and loss
adjustment expense ratio. Catastrophe losses in 2017 and 2016 accounted for 0.3 points of the loss and
loss adjustment expense ratio in each year. The underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in
2017 was 1.8 points higher than the 2016 ratio on the same basis, primarily reflecting the impact of a
higher level of international surety losses.

The underwriting expense ratio of 38.8% in 2017 was 0.5 points higher than the underwriting

expense ratio of 38.3% in 2016.

The combined ratio of 65.7% in 2016 was 3.4 points lower than the combined ratio of 69.1% in

2015.

The loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 27.4% in 2016 was 3.9 points lower than the loss and

loss adjustment expense ratio of 31.3% in 2015. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2016
and 2015 provided 15.5 points and 12.4 points of benefit, respectively, to the loss and loss adjustment
expense ratio. Catastrophe losses in 2016 and 2015 accounted for 0.3 points and 0.1 points, respectively,
of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio. The underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in
2016 was 1.0 points lower than the 2015 ratio on the same basis.

The underwriting expense ratio of 38.3% in 2016 was 0.5 points higher than the underwriting

expense ratio of 37.8% in 2015.

Overview

Segment income in 2017 was $128 million, $389 million or 75% lower than segment income of
$517 million in 2016, primarily reflecting the pre-tax impacts of (i) significantly higher catastrophe
losses, partially offset by (ii) higher net investment income, (iii) higher underlying underwriting margins
and (iv) net favorable prior year reserve development as compared to net unfavorable prior year
reserve development in 2016. Catastrophe losses in 2017 and 2016 were $1.09 billion and $408 million,
respectively. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2017 was $13 million, compared with net
unfavorable prior year reserve development of $3 million in 2016. The higher underlying underwriting
margins primarily resulted from the impacts of (i) increased business volumes and (ii) earned pricing
that modestly exceeded loss cost trends, partially offset by (iii) higher non-catastrophe weather-related
losses. Partially offsetting this net pre-tax decrease in segment income was a related decrease in income
tax expense. In addition, income tax expense in 2017 was reduced by $7 million as a result of the
resolution of prior year tax matters.

Segment income in 2016 was $517 million, $415 million or 45% lower than segment income of

$932 million in 2015, primarily reflecting the pre-tax impacts of (i) net unfavorable prior year reserve
development as compared to net favorable prior year reserve development in 2015, (ii) lower
underlying underwriting margins and (iii) higher catastrophe losses. Net unfavorable prior year reserve
development in 2016 was $3 million, compared with net favorable prior year reserve development of
$328 million in 2015. Catastrophe losses in 2016 and 2015 were $408 million and $266 million,
respectively. The lower underlying underwriting margins primarily resulted from higher loss estimates in
the Automobile product line for bodily injury liability coverages. Partially offsetting this net pre-tax
decrease in segment income was a related decrease in income tax expense.

Revenues

Earned Premiums

Earned premiums in 2017 were $9.23 billion, $811 million or 10% higher than in 2016. Earned

premiums in 2016 were $8.42 billion, $510 million or 6% higher than in 2015. The increase in earned
premiums in both 2017 and 2016 reflected increases in net written premiums over the preceding twelve
months.

91

Net Investment Income

Net investment income in 2017 was $383 million, $21 million or 6% higher than in 2016. Net

investment income in 2016 was $362 million, $6 million or 2% lower than in 2015. Refer to the ‘‘Net
Investment Income’’ section of ‘‘Consolidated Results of Operations’’ for a discussion of the changes in
the Company’s net investment income in 2017 and 2016 as compared with the respective prior year. In
addition, refer to note 2 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the
Company’s net investment income allocation methodology.

Other Revenues

Other revenues in all years presented included installment premium charges.

Claims and Expenses

Claims and Claim Adjustment Expenses

Claims and claim adjustment expenses in 2017 were $7.05 billion, $1.36 billion or 24% higher than
in 2016, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) significantly higher catastrophe losses, (ii) higher volumes
of insured exposures, (iii) loss cost trends and (iv) higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses,
partially offset by (v) net favorable prior year reserve development as compared with net unfavorable
prior year reserve development in 2016. Claims and claim adjustment expenses in 2016 were
$5.68 billion, $1.09 billion or 24% higher than in 2015, primarily reflecting (i) higher volumes of
insured exposures, (ii) net unfavorable prior year reserve development as compared to net favorable
prior year reserve development in 2015, (iii) higher catastrophe losses, (iv) higher loss estimates in the
Automobile product line for bodily injury liability coverages and (v) the impact of loss cost trends.

Net prior year reserve development in 2017 and 2016 was not significant. Factors contributing to

prior year reserve development during the year ended December 31, 2015 are discussed in more detail
in note 7 of notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Amortization of Deferred Acquisition Costs

Amortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2017 was $1.45 billion, $105 million or 8% higher
than in 2016. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2016 was $1.34 billion, $58 million or 5%
higher than in 2015. The increases in both 2017 and 2016 were generally consistent with the increases
in earned premiums.

General and Administrative Expenses

General and administrative expenses in 2017 were $1.11 billion, $13 million or 1% lower than in

2016. General and administrative expenses of $1.12 billion in 2016 were comparable with 2015.

Income Tax Expense (Benefit)

The income tax benefit in 2017 was $(44) million, compared with income tax expense of

$192 million in 2016, primarily reflecting the impact of the $625 million decrease in income before
income taxes in 2017, and the $7 million reduction in income tax expense resulting from the resolution
of prior year tax matters. Income tax expense in 2016 was $192 million, $224 million or 54% lower than
in 2015, primarily reflecting the impact of the $639 million decrease in income before income taxes in
2016. The level of income tax expense (benefit) in all years reflected the impact of tax-exempt
investment income on the calculation of the Company’s tax provision.

92

Combined Ratio

The combined ratio of 103.1% in 2017 was 7.3 points higher than the combined ratio of 95.8% in

2016.

The loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 76.3% in 2017 was 8.8 points higher than the loss
and loss adjustment expense ratio of 67.5% in 2016. Catastrophe losses accounted for 11.7 points and
4.9 points of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratios in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Net favorable
prior year reserve development in 2017 provided 0.1 points of benefit to the loss and loss adjustment
expense ratio. Net unfavorable prior year reserve development in 2016 had no impact on the loss and
loss adjustment expense ratio. The underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in 2017 was 2.1
points higher than the 2016 ratio on the same basis, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) higher
non-catastrophe weather-related losses, (ii) the tenure impact of higher levels of new business in recent
years in the Automobile product line and (iii) a higher level of automobile business relative to
homeowners and other business, partially offset by (iv) earned pricing that modestly exceeded loss cost
trends.

The underwriting expense ratio of 26.8% in 2017 was 1.5 points lower than the underwriting

expense ratio of 28.3% in 2016, primarily reflecting the impact of higher levels of earned premiums.
The combined ratio of 95.8% in 2016 was 8.4 points higher than the combined ratio of 87.4% in

2015.

The loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 67.5% in 2016 was 9.4 points higher than the loss

and loss adjustment expense ratio of 58.1% in 2015. Net unfavorable prior year reserve development in
2016 had no impact on the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio. Net favorable prior year reserve
development provided 4.2 points of benefit to the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in 2015.
Catastrophe losses accounted for 4.9 points and 3.4 points of the loss and loss adjustment expense
ratios in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in 2016 was
3.7 points higher than the 2015 ratio on the same basis, primarily reflecting (i) higher loss estimates in
the Automobile product line for bodily injury liability coverages, (ii) the tenure impact of higher levels
of new business in recent years in the Automobile product line and (iii) a higher level of automobile
business relative to homeowners and other business.

The underwriting expense ratio of 28.3% in 2016 was 1.0 points lower than the underwriting

expense ratio of 29.3% in 2015, primarily reflecting the impact of higher levels of earned premiums.

ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION

The Company believes that the property and casualty insurance industry has suffered from court
decisions and other trends that have expanded insurance coverage for asbestos claims far beyond the
original intent of insurers and policyholders. The Company has received and continues to receive a
significant number of asbestos claims from the Company’s policyholders (which includes others seeking
coverage under a policy). Factors underlying these claim filings include continued intensive advertising
by lawyers seeking asbestos claimants and the continued focus by plaintiffs on defendants who were not
traditionally primary targets of asbestos litigation. The focus on these defendants is primarily the result
of the number of traditional asbestos defendants who have sought bankruptcy protection in previous
years. In addition to contributing to the overall number of claims, bankruptcy proceedings may increase
the volatility of asbestos-related losses by initially delaying the reporting of claims and later by
significantly accelerating and increasing loss payments by insurers, including the Company. The
bankruptcy of many traditional defendants has also caused increased settlement demands against those
policyholders who are not in bankruptcy but remain in the tort system. Currently, in many jurisdictions,
those who allege very serious injury and who can present credible medical evidence of their injuries are
receiving priority trial settings in the courts, while those who have not shown any credible disease
manifestation are having their hearing dates delayed or placed on an inactive docket. Prioritizing claims
involving credible evidence of injuries, along with the focus on defendants who were not traditionally
primary targets of asbestos litigation, contributes to the claims and claim adjustment expense payment
patterns experienced by the Company. The Company’s asbestos-related claims and claim adjustment
expense experience also has been impacted by the unavailability of other insurance sources potentially
available to policyholders, whether through exhaustion of policy limits or through the insolvency of
other participating insurers.

The Company continues to be involved in coverage litigation concerning a number of

policyholders, some of whom have filed for bankruptcy, who in some instances have asserted that all or
a portion of their asbestos-related claims are not subject to aggregate limits on coverage. In these
instances, policyholders also may assert that each individual bodily injury claim should be treated as a
separate occurrence under the policy. It is difficult to predict whether these policyholders will be
successful on both issues. To the extent both issues are resolved in a policyholder’s favor and other
Company defenses are not successful, the Company’s coverage obligations under the policies at issue
would be materially increased and bounded only by the applicable per-occurrence limits and the
number of asbestos bodily injury claims against the policyholders. Although the Company has seen a
reduction in the overall risk associated with these lawsuits, it remains difficult to predict the ultimate
cost of these claims.

Many coverage disputes with policyholders are only resolved through settlement agreements.
Because many policyholders make exaggerated demands, it is difficult to predict the outcome of
settlement negotiations. Settlements involving bankrupt policyholders may include extensive releases
which are favorable to the Company but which could result in settlements for larger amounts than
originally anticipated. There also may be instances where a court may not approve a proposed

95

settlement, which may result in additional litigation and potentially less beneficial outcomes for the
Company. As in the past, the Company will continue to pursue settlement opportunities.

In addition to claims against policyholders, proceedings have been launched directly against
insurers, including the Company, by individuals challenging insurers’ conduct with respect to the
handling of past asbestos claims and by individuals seeking damages arising from alleged asbestos-
related bodily injuries. Travelers Property Casualty Corp. (TPC) had previously entered into settlement
agreements in connection with a number of these direct action claims (Direct Action Settlements). The
Company had been involved in litigation concerning whether all of the conditions of the Direct Action
Settlements had been satisfied. On July 22, 2014, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit ruled that all of the conditions of the Direct Action Settlements had been satisfied. On
January 15, 2015, the bankruptcy court entered an order directing the Company to pay $579 million to
the plaintiffs, comprised of the $502 million settlement amounts, plus pre- and post-judgment interest
of $77 million, which the Company paid in 2015. It is possible that the filing of other direct actions
against insurers, including the Company, could be made in the future. It is difficult to predict the
outcome of these proceedings, including whether the plaintiffs would be able to sustain these actions
against insurers based on novel legal theories of liability. The Company believes it has meritorious
defenses to any such claims and has received favorable rulings in certain jurisdictions.

On January 29, 2009, the Company and PPG Industries, Inc. (PPG), along with approximately 30
other insurers of PPG, agreed in principle to settle asbestos-related coverage litigation under insurance
policies issued to PPG (the ‘‘Agreement’’). The Agreement was incorporated into the Modified Third
Amended Plan of Reorganization (‘‘Amended Plan’’) proposed as part of the Pittsburgh Corning Corp.
(PCC, which is 50% owned by PPG) bankruptcy proceeding. Pursuant to the Amended Plan, which was
filed on January 30, 2009, PCC, along with enumerated other companies (including PPG as well as the
Company as a participating insurer), receive protections afforded by Section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy
Code from certain asbestos-related bodily injury claims. Under the Agreement, the Company had the
option to make a series of payments over 20 years totaling approximately $620 million to the trust
created under the Amended Plan, or it could elect to make a discounted payment. On January 7, 2016,
the remaining objections to the Amended Plan were dismissed. On April 27, 2016, the Amended Plan
became effective and all the remaining conditions to the Agreement were satisfied. The Company fully
satisfied its obligation under the Agreement by making a discounted payment in the second quarter of
2016. The Company’s payment totaled $524 million, of which $518 million was related to asbestos
reserves. The Company’s obligations under the Agreement were included in its claims and claim
adjustment expense reserves at December 31, 2015.

Because each policyholder presents different liability and coverage issues, the Company generally

reviews the exposure presented by each policyholder at least annually. Among the factors which the
Company may consider in the course of this review are: available insurance coverage, including the role
of any umbrella or excess insurance the Company has issued to the policyholder; limits and deductibles;
an analysis of the policyholder’s potential liability; the jurisdictions involved; past and anticipated future
claim activity and loss development on pending claims; past settlement values of similar claims;
allocated claim adjustment expense; potential role of other insurance; the role, if any, of non-asbestos
claims or potential non-asbestos claims in any resolution process; and applicable coverage defenses or
determinations, if any, including the determination as to whether or not an asbestos claim is a products/
completed operation claim subject to an aggregate limit and the available coverage, if any, for that
claim.

96

In the third quarter of 2017, the Company completed its annual in-depth asbestos claim review,

including a review of active policyholders and litigation cases for potential product and ‘‘non-product’’
liability, and noted the continuation of the following trends:

(cid:127) a high level of litigation activity in certain jurisdictions involving individuals alleging serious

asbestos-related illness, primarily involving mesothelioma claims;

(cid:127) while overall payment patterns have been generally stable, there has been an increase in severity

for certain policyholders due to a high level of litigation activity; and

(cid:127) a moderate level of asbestos-related bankruptcy activity.
In the Home Office and Field Office category, which accounts for the vast majority of

policyholders with active asbestos-related claims, the number of policyholders tendering asbestos claims
for the first time and the number of policyholders with open asbestos claims declined slightly when
compared to 2016 while gross asbestos-related payments were higher. Payments on behalf of
policyholders in this category continue to be influenced by a high level of litigation activity in a limited
number of jurisdictions where individuals alleging serious asbestos-related injury, primarily
mesothelioma, continue to target defendants who were not traditionally primary targets of asbestos
litigation.

The Company’s quarterly asbestos reserve reviews include an analysis of exposure and claim

payment patterns by policyholder category, as well as recent settlements, policyholder bankruptcies,
judicial rulings and legislative actions. The Company also analyzes developing payment patterns among
policyholders in the Home Office and Field Office, and Assumed Reinsurance and Other categories as
well as projected reinsurance billings and recoveries. In addition, the Company reviews its historical
gross and net loss and expense paid experience, year-by-year, to assess any emerging trends,
fluctuations, or characteristics suggested by the aggregate paid activity. Conventional actuarial methods
are not utilized to establish asbestos reserves and the Company’s evaluations have not resulted in a
reliable method to determine a meaningful average asbestos defense or indemnity payment.

The completion of these reviews and analyses in 2017, 2016 and 2015 resulted in $225 million,

$225 million and $224 million increases, respectively, in the Company’s net asbestos reserves. In each
year, the reserve increases were primarily driven by increases in the Company’s estimate of projected
settlement and defense costs related to a broad number of policyholders in the Home Office category
due to a higher than previously anticipated level of litigation activity surrounding mesothelioma claims.
This increase in the estimate of projected settlement and defense costs resulted from payment trends
that continue to be higher than previously anticipated due to the impact of the current litigation
environment discussed above. Over the past decade, the property and casualty insurance industry,
including the Company, has experienced net unfavorable prior year reserve development with regard to
asbestos reserves, but the Company believes that over that period there has been a reduction in the
volatility associated with the Company’s overall asbestos exposure as the overall asbestos environment
has evolved from one dominated by exposure to significant litigation risks, particularly coverage
disputes relating to policyholders in bankruptcy who were asserting that their claims were not subject to
the aggregate limits contained in their policies, to an environment primarily driven by a frequency of
litigation related to individuals with mesothelioma. The Company’s overall view of the current
underlying asbestos environment is essentially unchanged from recent periods and there remains a high
degree of uncertainty with respect to future exposure to asbestos claims.

The Policyholders with Settlement Agreements category includes structured settlements, coverage

in place arrangements and, with respect to TPC, Wellington accounts (as discussed below). Reserves
are based on the expected payout for each policyholder under the applicable agreement. Structured
settlements are arrangements under which policyholders and/or plaintiffs agree to fixed financial
amounts to be paid at scheduled times. Coverage in place arrangements represent agreements with
policyholders on specified amounts of coverage to be provided. Payment obligations may be subject to
annual maximums and are only made when valid claims are presented. Wellington accounts refer to the
35 defendants that are parties to a 1985 agreement settling certain disputes concerning insurance
coverage for their asbestos claims. Many of the aspects of the Wellington agreement are similar to
those of coverage in place arrangements in which the parties have agreed on specific amounts of
coverage and the terms under which the coverage can be accessed. In 2016, the Company paid the
$518 million settlement related to asbestos-related coverage litigation under insurance policies issued to
PPG, as described above.

The Home Office and Field Office category relates to all other policyholders and also includes

IBNR reserves and reserves for the costs of defending asbestos-related coverage litigation. IBNR
reserves in the Home Office and Field Office category include amounts for new claims and adverse
development on existing Home Office and Field Office policyholders, as well as reserves for claims
from policyholders reporting asbestos claims for the first time and for policyholders for which there is,
or may be, litigation. Policyholders are identified for the annual home office review based upon, among
other factors: a combination of past payments and current case reserves in excess of a specified
threshold (currently $100,000), perceived level of exposure, number of reported claims, products/
completed operations and potential ‘‘non-product’’ exposures, size of policyholder and geographic
distribution of products or services sold by the policyholder. The Assumed Reinsurance and Other
category primarily consists of reinsurance of excess coverage, including various pool participations.

Net asbestos paid loss and loss expenses in 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $271 million, $708 million

and $770 million, respectively. Net payments in 2016 included the $458 million payment related to the
PPG settlement, as described above. Net payments in 2015 included the $502 million payment related
to the Direct Action Settlements as described above. Approximately 4%, 69% and 69% of total net
paid losses in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, related to policyholders with whom the Company had
entered into settlement agreements limiting the Company’s liability.

See ‘‘—Uncertainty Regarding Adequacy of Asbestos and Environmental Reserves.’’

ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION

The Company has received and continues to receive claims from policyholders who allege that they
are liable for injury or damage arising out of their alleged disposition of toxic substances. Mostly, these
claims are due to various legislative as well as regulatory efforts aimed at environmental remediation.
For instance, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
(CERCLA), enacted in 1980 and later modified, enables private parties as well as federal and state
governments to take action with respect to releases and threatened releases of hazardous substances.
This federal statute permits the recovery of response costs from some liable parties and may require
liable parties to undertake their own remedial action. Liability under CERCLA may be joint and
several with other responsible parties.

The Company has been, and continues to be, involved in litigation involving insurance coverage

issues pertaining to environmental claims. The Company believes that some court decisions have
interpreted the insurance coverage to be broader than the original intent of the insurers and
policyholders. These decisions often pertain to insurance policies that were issued by the Company
prior to the mid-1980s. These decisions continue to be inconsistent and vary from jurisdiction to
jurisdiction. Environmental claims, when submitted, rarely indicate the monetary amount being sought
by the claimant from the policyholder, and the Company does not keep track of the monetary amount
being sought in those few claims which indicate a monetary amount.

The resolution of environmental exposures by the Company generally occurs through settlements

with policyholders as opposed to claimants. Generally, the Company strives to extinguish any

99

obligations it may have under any policy issued to the policyholder for past, present and future
environmental liabilities and extinguish any pending coverage litigation dispute with the policyholder.
This form of settlement is commonly referred to as a ‘‘buy-back’’ of policies for future environmental
liability. In addition, many of the agreements have also extinguished any insurance obligation which the
Company may have for other claims, including, but not limited to, asbestos and other cumulative injury
claims. The Company and its policyholders may also agree to settlements which extinguish any liability
arising from known specified sites or claims. Where appropriate, these agreements also include
indemnities and hold harmless provisions to protect the Company. The Company’s general purpose in
executing these agreements is to reduce the Company’s potential environmental exposure and eliminate
the risks presented by coverage litigation with the policyholder and related costs.

In establishing environmental reserves, the Company evaluates the exposure presented by each

policyholder and the anticipated cost of resolution, if any. In the course of this analysis, the Company
generally considers the probable liability, available coverage and relevant judicial interpretations. In
addition, the Company considers the many variables presented, such as: the nature of the alleged
activities of the policyholder at each site; the number of sites; the total number of potentially
responsible parties at each site; the nature of the alleged environmental harm and the corresponding
remedy at each site; the nature of government enforcement activities at each site; the ownership and
general use of each site; the overall nature of the insurance relationship between the Company and the
policyholder, including the role of any umbrella or excess insurance the Company has issued to the
policyholder; the involvement of other insurers; the potential for other available coverage, including the
number of years of coverage; the role, if any, of non-environmental claims or potential
non-environmental claims in any resolution process; and the applicable law in each jurisdiction. The
evaluation of the exposure presented by a policyholder can change as information concerning that
policyholder and the many variables presented is developed. Conventional actuarial methods are not
used to estimate these reserves.

In its review of environmental reserves, the Company considers: past settlement payments;

changing judicial and legislative trends; its reserves for the costs of litigating environmental coverage
matters; the potential for policyholders with smaller exposures to be named in new clean-up actions for
both on- and off-site waste disposal activities; the potential for adverse development; the potential for
additional new claims beyond previous expectations; and the potential higher costs for new settlements.
The duration of the Company’s investigation and review of these claims and the time necessary to
determine an appropriate estimate, if any, of the value of the claim to the Company vary significantly
and are dependent upon a number of factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, the
cooperation of the policyholder in providing claim information, the pace of underlying litigation or
claim processes, the pace of coverage litigation between the policyholder and the Company and the
willingness of the policyholder and the Company to negotiate, if appropriate, a resolution of any
dispute pertaining to these claims. Because these factors vary from claim-to-claim and
policyholder-by-policyholder, the Company cannot provide a meaningful average of the duration of an
environmental claim. However, based upon the Company’s experience in resolving these claims, the
duration may vary from months to several years.

The Company continues to receive notices from policyholders tendering claims for the first time,

frequently under policies issued prior to the mid-1980s. These policyholders continue to present smaller
exposures, have fewer sites and are lower tier defendants. Further, in many instances, clean-up costs
have been reduced because regulatory agencies are willing to accept risk-based site analyses and more
efficient clean-up technologies. Over the past several years, the Company has experienced generally
favorable trends in the number of new policyholders tendering environmental claims for the first time
and in the number of pending declaratory judgment actions relating to environmental matters.
However, the degree to which those favorable trends have continued has been less than anticipated. In
addition, reserve development on existing environmental claims has been greater than anticipated,

100

driven by claims and legal developments in a limited number of jurisdictions. As a result of these
factors, in 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company increased its net environmental reserves by $65 million,
$82 million and $72 million, respectively.

Net environmental paid loss and loss expenses were $88 million, $61 million and $55 million in

2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. At December 31, 2017, approximately 94% of the net environmental
reserve (approximately $340 million) was carried in a bulk reserve and included unresolved
environmental claims, incurred but not reported environmental claims and the anticipated cost of
coverage litigation disputes relating to these claims. The bulk reserve the Company carries is
established and adjusted based upon the aggregate volume of in-process environmental claims and the
Company’s experience in resolving those claims. The balance, approximately 6% of the net
environmental reserve (approximately $20 million), consists of case reserves.

UNCERTAINTY REGARDING ADEQUACY OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES

As a result of the processes and procedures discussed above, management believes that the

reserves carried for asbestos and environmental claims are appropriately established based upon known
facts, current law and management’s judgment. However, the uncertainties surrounding the final
resolution of these claims continue, and it is difficult to determine the ultimate exposure for asbestos
and environmental claims and related litigation. As a result, these reserves are subject to revision as
new information becomes available and as claims develop. The continuing uncertainties include,
without limitation, the risks and lack of predictability inherent in complex litigation, any impact from
the bankruptcy protection sought by various asbestos producers and other asbestos defendants, a
further increase or decrease in the cost to resolve, and/or the number of, asbestos and environmental
claims beyond that which is anticipated, the emergence of a greater number of asbestos claims than

101

anticipated as a result of extended life expectancies resulting from medical advances and lifestyle
improvements, the role of any umbrella or excess policies the Company has issued, the resolution or
adjudication of disputes pertaining to the amount of available coverage for asbestos and environmental
claims in a manner inconsistent with the Company’s previous assessment of these claims, the number
and outcome of direct actions against the Company, future developments pertaining to the Company’s
ability to recover reinsurance for asbestos and environmental claims and the unavailability of other
insurance sources potentially available to policyholders, whether through exhaustion of policy limits or
through the insolvency of other participating insurers. In addition, uncertainties arise from the
insolvency or bankruptcy of policyholders and other defendants. It is also not possible to predict
changes in the legal, regulatory and legislative environment and their impact on the future development
of asbestos and environmental claims. This environment could be affected by changes in applicable
legislation and future court and regulatory decisions and interpretations, including the outcome of legal
challenges to legislative and/or judicial reforms establishing medical criteria for the pursuit of asbestos
claims. It is also difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of complex coverage disputes until settlement
negotiations near completion and significant legal questions are resolved or, failing settlement, until the
dispute is adjudicated. This is particularly the case with policyholders in bankruptcy where negotiations
often involve a large number of claimants and other parties and require court approval to be effective.
As part of its continuing analysis of asbestos and environmental reserves, the Company continues to
study the implications of these and other developments.

Because of the uncertainties set forth above, additional liabilities may arise for amounts in excess
of the Company’s current insurance reserves. In addition, the Company’s estimate of claims and claim
adjustment expenses may change. These additional liabilities or increases in estimates, or a range of
either, cannot now be reasonably estimated and could result in income statement charges that could be
material to the Company’s operating results in future periods.

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO

The Company’s invested assets at December 31, 2017 were $72.50 billion, of which 93% was
invested in fixed maturity and short-term investments, 1% in equity securities, 1% in real estate
investments and 5% in other investments. Because the primary purpose of the investment portfolio is
to fund future claims payments, the Company employs a conservative investment philosophy. A
significant majority of funds available for investment are deployed in a widely diversified portfolio of
high quality, liquid, taxable U.S. government, tax-exempt U.S. municipal and taxable corporate and U.S.
agency mortgage-backed bonds.

The carrying value of the Company’s fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 2017 was

$62.69 billion. The Company closely monitors the duration of its fixed maturity investments, and
investment purchases and sales are executed with the objective of having adequate funds available to
satisfy the Company’s insurance and debt obligations. The weighted average credit quality of the
Company’s fixed maturity portfolio, both including and excluding U.S. Treasury securities, was ‘‘Aa2’’ at
both December 31, 2017 and 2016. Below investment grade securities represented 2.7% and 2.9% of
the total fixed maturity investment portfolio at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The weighted
average effective duration of fixed maturities and short-term securities was 4.0 (4.3 excluding short-term
securities) at December 31, 2017 and 4.2 (4.5 excluding short-term securities) at December 31, 2016.

Obligations of States, Municipalities and Political Subdivisions

The Company’s fixed maturity investment portfolio at December 31, 2017 and 2016 included

$30.92 billion and $31.91 billion, respectively, of securities which are obligations of states, municipalities
and political subdivisions (collectively referred to as the municipal bond portfolio). The municipal bond
portfolio is diversified across the United States, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico and includes
general obligation and revenue bonds issued by states, cities, counties, school districts and similar
issuers. Included in the municipal bond portfolio at December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $3.90 billion and
$5.16 billion, respectively, of pre-refunded bonds, which are bonds for which states or municipalities
have established irrevocable trusts, almost exclusively comprised of U.S. Treasury securities and
obligations of U.S. government and government agencies and authorities. These trusts were created to
fund the payment of principal and interest due under the bonds. The irrevocable trusts are verified as
to their sufficiency by an independent verification agent of the underwriter, issuer or trustee. All of the
Company’s holdings of securities issued by Puerto Rico and related entities have been pre-refunded
and therefore are defeased by U.S. Treasury securities.

(1) Rated using external rating agencies or by the Company when a public rating does not exist. The

table includes $335 million of short-term securities which have the highest ratings issued by
external rating agencies for short-term issuances. For purposes of this table, the short-term
securities, which are rated ‘‘A-1+’’ and/or ‘‘P-1,’’ are included as ‘‘Aaa’’ rated securities.
In addition to fixed maturities noted in the foregoing table, the Company has exposure totaling

$153 million to private equity limited partnerships and real estate partnerships (both of which are
included in other investments in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet) whose primary investing
focus is across Europe. The Company has unfunded commitments totaling $134 million to these
partnerships. The Company has no non-redeemable preferred stock issued by companies in the
Eurozone.

Mortgage-Backed Securities, Collateralized Mortgage Obligations and Pass-Through Securities

The Company’s fixed maturity investment portfolio at December 31, 2017 and 2016 included

$2.41 billion and $1.71 billion, respectively, of residential mortgage-backed securities, including
pass-through-securities and collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), all of which are subject to
prepayment risk (either shortening or lengthening of duration). While prepayment risk for securities
and its effect on income cannot be fully controlled, particularly when interest rates move dramatically,
the Company’s investment strategy generally favors securities that reduce this risk within expected
interest rate ranges. The Company makes investments in residential CMOs that are either guaranteed
by GNMA, FNMA or FHLMC, or if not guaranteed, are senior or super-senior positions within their
respective securitizations. Both guaranteed and non-guaranteed residential CMOs allocate the
distribution of payments from the underlying mortgages among different classes of bondholders. In
addition, non-guaranteed residential CMOs provide structures that allocate the impact of credit losses
to different classes of bondholders. Senior and super-senior CMOs are protected, to varying degrees,

107

from credit losses as those losses are initially allocated to subordinated bondholders. The Company’s
investment strategy is to purchase CMO tranches that are expected to offer the most favorable return
given the Company’s assessment of associated risks. The Company does not purchase residual interests
in CMOs. For more information regarding the Company’s investments in residential mortgage-backed
securities, see note 3 of notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Alternative Documentation Mortgages and Sub-Prime Mortgages

At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company’s fixed maturity investment portfolio included

CMOs backed by alternative documentation mortgages and asset-backed securities collateralized by
sub-prime mortgages with a collective fair value of $111 million and $142 million, respectively
(comprising less than 1% of the Company’s total fixed maturity investments at both dates). The
Company defines sub-prime mortgage-backed securities as investments in which the underlying loans
primarily exhibit one or more of the following characteristics: low FICO scores, above-prime interest
rates, high loan-to-value ratios or high debt-to-income ratios. Alternative documentation securitizations
are those in which the underlying loans primarily meet the government-sponsored entities’ requirements
for credit score but do not meet the government-sponsored entities’ guidelines for documentation,
property type, debt and loan-to-value ratios. The weighted average credit rating on these securities and
obligations held by the Company was ‘‘B1’’ and ‘‘Ba3’’ at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
The Company does not believe this portfolio exposes it to a material adverse impact on its results of
operations, financial position or liquidity, due to the portfolio’s relatively small size.

Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities and Project Loans

At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company held commercial mortgage-backed securities

(including FHA project loans) of $1.17 billion and $938 million, respectively. The Company does not
believe this portfolio exposes it to a material adverse impact on its results of operations, financial
position or liquidity, due to the portfolio’s relatively small size and the underlying credit strength of
these securities. For more information regarding the Company’s investments in commercial mortgage-
backed securities, see note 3 of notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Equity Securities Available for Sale, Real Estate and Short-Term Investments

See note 1 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information about these

invested asset classes.

Other Investments

The Company also invests in private equity limited partnerships, hedge funds and real estate

partnerships. Also included in other investments are non-public common and preferred equities and
derivatives. These asset classes have historically provided a higher return than fixed maturities but are
subject to more volatility. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the carrying value of the Company’s other
investments was $3.53 billion and $3.45 billion, respectively.

Securities Lending

The Company has, from time to time, engaged in securities lending activities from which it

generates net investment income by lending certain of its investments to other institutions for short
periods of time. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had $304 million and $286 million of
securities on loan, respectively, as part of a tri-party lending agreement. The average monthly balance
of securities on loan during 2017 and 2016 was $318 million and $346 million, respectively. Borrowers
of these securities provide collateral equal to at least 102% of the market value of the loaned securities

108

plus accrued interest. The Company has not incurred any investment losses in its securities lending
program for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.

Lloyd’s Trust Deposits

The Company meets its capital requirements to support its underwriting at Lloyd’s using a

combination of trust deposits and uncollateralized letters of credit. Securities with a fair value of
approximately $37 million and $97 million held by a wholly-owned subsidiary at December 31, 2017 and
2016, respectively, and $33 million held by TRV at December 31, 2017, were pledged into Lloyd’s trust
accounts to provide a portion of the Lloyd’s capital requirements. For more information regarding the
Company’s utilization of uncollateralized letters of credit, see ‘‘Liquidity and Capital Resources’’ herein.

Net unrealized investment gains included in shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2017 increased
from the prior year-end, primarily reflecting the impact of a decrease in market interest rates in 2017
and the tax effect of the TCJA. Net unrealized investment gains included in shareholders’ equity at
December 31, 2016 decreased from the prior year-end, primarily reflecting the impact of an increase in
market interest rates in 2016.

At December 31, 2017, the amount of gross unrealized losses for all fixed maturity and equity

investments reported at fair value for which fair value was less than 80% of amortized cost for fixed
maturity investments and cost for equity investments was not significant.

For fixed maturity investments where fair value is less than the carrying value and the Company
did not reach a decision to impair, the Company continues to have the intent and ability to hold such
investments to a projected recovery in value, which may not be until maturity.

At December 31, 2017 and 2016, below investment grade securities comprised 2.7% and 2.9%,

respectively, of the Company’s fixed maturity investment portfolio. Included in below investment grade
securities at December 31, 2017 were securities in an unrealized loss position that, in the aggregate,
had an amortized cost of $313 million and a fair value of $305 million, resulting in a net pre-tax
unrealized investment loss of $8 million. These securities in an unrealized loss position represented
approximately 0.5% of the total amortized cost and 0.5% of the fair value of the fixed maturity
portfolio at December 31, 2017 and accounted for 4.5% of the total gross pre-tax unrealized investment
loss in the fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 2017.

Purchases and sales of investments are based on cash requirements, the characteristics of the

insurance liabilities and current market conditions. The Company identifies investments to be sold to
achieve its primary investment goals of assuring the Company’s ability to meet policyholder obligations
as well as to optimize investment returns, given these obligations.

CATASTROPHE MODELING

The Company uses various analyses and methods, including proprietary and third-party computer
modeling processes, to make underwriting and reinsurance decisions designed to manage its exposure
to catastrophic events. There are no industry-standard methodologies or assumptions for projecting
catastrophe exposure. Accordingly, catastrophe estimates provided by different insurers may not be
comparable.

The Company actively monitors and evaluates changes in third-party models and, when necessary,

calibrates the catastrophe risk model estimates delivered via its own proprietary modeling processes.
The Company considers historical loss experience, recent events, underwriting practices, market share
analyses, external scientific analysis and various other factors including non-modeled losses, to refine its
proprietary view of catastrophe risk. These proprietary models are continually updated as new
information and techniques emerge.

110

The tables below set forth the probabilities that estimated losses, comprising claims and allocated
claim adjustment expenses (but excluding unallocated claim adjustment expenses), from a single event
occurring in a one-year timeframe will equal or exceed the indicated loss amounts (expressed in dollars,
net of tax at the newly enacted federal tax rate of 21%, and as a percentage of the Company’s common
equity), based on the proprietary and third-party computer models utilized by the Company at
December 31, 2017. For example, on the basis described below the tables, the Company estimates that
there is a one percent chance that the Company’s loss from a single U.S. and Canadian hurricane in a
one-year timeframe would equal or exceed $1.6 billion, or 7% of the Company’s common equity at
December 31, 2017.

(1) An event that has, for example, a 2% likelihood of exceedance is sometimes described as
a ‘‘1-in-50 year event.’’ As noted above, however, the probabilities in the table represent
the likelihood of losses from a single event equaling or exceeding the indicated threshold
loss amount in a one-year timeframe, not over a multi-year timeframe. Also, because the
probabilities relate to a single event, the probabilities do not address the likelihood of
more than one event occurring in a particular period, and, therefore, the amounts do not
address potential aggregate catastrophe losses occurring in a one-year timeframe.

(2) The percentage of common equity is calculated by dividing (a) indicated loss amounts in
dollars by (b) total common equity excluding net unrealized investment gains and losses,
net of taxes, included in shareholders’ equity. Net unrealized investment gains and losses
can be significantly impacted by both discretionary and other economic factors and are
not necessarily indicative of operating trends. Accordingly, the Company’s management
uses the percentage of common equity calculated on this basis as a metric to evaluate the
potential impact of a single hurricane or single earthquake on the Company’s financial
position for purposes of making underwriting and reinsurance decisions.

The threshold loss amounts in the tables above, which are based on the Company’s in-force

portfolio at December 31, 2017 and catastrophe reinsurance program at January 1, 2018, are net of
reinsurance, after-tax and exclude unallocated claim adjustment expenses, which historically have been
less than 10% of loss estimates. For further information regarding the Company’s reinsurance, see
‘‘Item 1—Reinsurance.’’ The amounts for hurricanes reflect U.S. and Canadian exposures and include
property exposures, property residual market exposures and an adjustment for certain non-property
exposures. The hurricane loss amounts are based on the Company’s catastrophe risk model estimates
and include losses from the hurricane hazards of wind and storm surge. The amounts for earthquakes

111

reflect U.S. and Canadian property and workers’ compensation exposures. The Company does not
believe that the inclusion of hurricane or earthquake losses arising from other geographical areas or
other exposures would materially change the estimated threshold loss amounts.

Catastrophe modeling relies upon inputs based on experience, science, engineering and history.
These inputs reflect a significant amount of judgment and are subject to changes which may result in
volatility in the modeled output. Catastrophe modeling output may also fail to account for risks that
are outside the range of normal probability or are otherwise unforeseeable. Catastrophe modeling
assumptions include, among others, the portion of purchased reinsurance that is collectible after a
catastrophic event, which may prove to be materially incorrect. Consequently, catastrophe modeling
estimates are subject to significant uncertainty. In the tables above, the uncertainty associated with the
estimated threshold loss amounts increases significantly as the likelihood of exceedance decreases. In
other words, in the case of a relatively more remote event (e.g., 1-in-1,000), the estimated threshold
loss amount is relatively less reliable. Actual losses from an event could materially exceed the indicated
threshold loss amount. In addition, more than one such event could occur in any period.

Moreover, the Company is exposed to the risk of material losses from other than property and

workers’ compensation coverages arising out of hurricanes and earthquakes, and it is exposed to
catastrophe losses from perils other than hurricanes and earthquakes, such as tornadoes and other
windstorms, hail, wildfires, severe winter weather, floods, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions and other
naturally-occurring events, such as solar flares, as well as acts of terrorism and cyber events.

For more information about the Company’s exposure to catastrophe losses, see ‘‘Item 1A—Risk

Factors—Catastrophe losses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, our
financial position and/or liquidity, and could adversely impact our ratings, our ability to raise capital
and the availability and cost of reinsurance’’ and ‘‘Item 1A—Risk Factors—We may be adversely
affected if our pricing and capital models provide materially different indications than actual results.’’

CHANGING CLIMATE CONDITIONS

Severe weather events over the last two decades have underscored the unpredictability of future

climate trends and created uncertainty regarding insurers’ exposures to financial loss as a result of
catastrophes and other weather-related events. For example, hurricane and storm surge activity have
impacted areas further inland than previously experienced, and demographic changes have resulted in
larger populations in coastal areas which historically have been subject to severe storms, thus expanding
the Company’s potential for losses from hurricanes. Additionally, both the frequency and severity of
tornado and hail storms in the United States have been more volatile during the last decade.
Accordingly, the Company may be subject to increased losses from catastrophes and other weather-
related events. Demographic changes in areas prone to wildfires have also expanded the Company’s
potential for losses from wildfires. Additionally, the Company’s catastrophe models may be less reliable
due to the increased unpredictability in frequency and severity of severe weather events or other
emerging trends in climate conditions.

The Company discusses how potentially changing climate conditions may present other issues for

its business under ‘‘Item 1A—Risk Factors’’ and ‘‘Outlook.’’ For example, among other things:

(cid:127) Increasingly unpredictable and severe weather conditions could result in increased frequency and
severity of claims under policies issued by the Company. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Catastrophe losses
could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, our financial position and/or
liquidity, and could adversely impact our ratings, our ability to raise capital and the availability
and cost of reinsurance’’ and ‘‘—Outlook—Underwriting Gain/Loss.’’

(cid:127) Changing climate conditions could also impact the creditworthiness of issuers of securities in

which the Company invests. For example, water supply adequacy could impact the

112

creditworthiness of bond issuers in the Southwestern United States, and more frequent and/or
severe hurricanes could impact the creditworthiness of issuers in the Southeastern United States,
among other areas. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Our investment portfolio is subject to credit and interest
rate risk, and may suffer reduced returns or material realized or unrealized losses.’’

(cid:127) Increased regulation adopted in response to potential changes in climate conditions may impact

the Company and its customers. For example, state insurance regulation could impact the
Company’s ability to manage property exposures in areas vulnerable to significant climate driven
losses. If the Company is unable to implement risk based pricing, modify policy terms or reduce
exposures to the extent necessary to address rising losses related to catastrophes and smaller
scale weather events (should those increased losses occur), its business may be adversely
affected. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Catastrophe losses could materially and adversely affect our results
of operations, our financial position and/or liquidity, and could adversely impact our ratings, our
ability to raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance.’’ In addition, climate change
regulation could increase the Company’s customers’ costs of doing business. For example,
insureds faced with carbon management regulatory requirements may have less available capital
for investment in loss prevention and safety features which may, over time, increase loss
exposures. Increased regulation may also result in reduced economic activity, which would
decrease the amount of insurable assets and businesses.

(cid:127) The full range of potential liability exposures related to changing climate conditions continues to

evolve. Through the Company’s Emerging Issues Committee and its Committee on Climate,
Energy and the Environment, the Company works with its business units and corporate groups,
as appropriate, to identify and try to assess climate change-related liability issues, which are
continually evolving and often hard to fully evaluate. The Company regularly reviews emerging
issues, including changing climate conditions, to consider potential changes to its modeling and
the use of such modeling, as well as to help determine the need for new underwriting strategies,
coverage modifications or new products. See ‘‘Risk Factors—The effects of emerging claim and
coverage issues on our business are uncertain.’’

REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES

The Company reinsures a portion of the risks it underwrites in order to control its exposure to

losses. For additional discussion regarding the Company’s reinsurance coverage, see ‘‘Part I—Item 1—

At December 31, 2017, the Company held $972 million of collateral in the form of letters of credit,

funds and trust agreements held to fully or partially collateralize certain reinsurance recoverables.
Included in reinsurance recoverables are amounts related to structured settlements, which are
annuities purchased from various life insurance companies to settle certain personal physical injury
claims, of which workers’ compensation claims comprise a significant portion. In cases where the
Company did not receive a release from the claimant, the amount due from the life insurance company
related to the structured settlement is included in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as a
reinsurance recoverable and the related claim cost is included in the liability for claims and claim
adjustment expense reserves, as the Company retains the contingent liability to the claimant. If it is
expected that the life insurance company is not able to pay, the Company would recognize an
impairment of the related reinsurance recoverable if, and to the extent, the purchased annuities are not
covered by state guaranty associations. In the event that the life insurance company fails to make the
required annuity payments, the Company would be required to make such payments. The following
table presents the Company’s top five groups by structured settlements at December 31, 2017

(1) On November 30, 2017, CF Corporation acquired Fidelity & Guaranty Life and changed its name

to FGL Holdings.

(2) On October 23, 2016, Genworth Financial (Genworth) announced that they have entered into a

definitive agreement under which China Oceanwide Holdings Group Co., Ltd. (China Oceanwide)
agreed to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Genworth. On March 7, 2017, Genworth
stockholders adopted the merger agreement, and the acquisition is pending the receipt of required
regulatory approvals. China Oceanwide is a privately held, family-owned international financial
holding group headquartered in Beijing, China. On February 12, 2018, A.M. Best downgraded the
financial strength rating of Genworth Life & Annuity Insurance Company to B+ (Good) from
B++ (Good), and downgraded Genworth Life Insurance Company and Genworth Life Insurance
Company of New York to Bǁ (Fair) from B (Fair) and has maintained the under-review status of
all ratings and revised the implications to developing from negative. The parties to the transaction
agreed to extend the closing deadline for the transaction until April 1, 2018.

114

The Company considers the ratings and related outlook assigned to reinsurance companies and life
insurance companies by various independent ratings agencies in assessing the adequacy of its allowance
for uncollectible amounts.

OUTLOOK

The following discussion provides outlook information for certain key drivers of the Company’s

results of operations and capital position.

Premiums. The Company’s earned premiums are a function of net written premium volume. Net

written premiums comprise both renewal business and new business and are recognized as earned
premium over the life of the underlying policies. When business renews, the amount of net written
premiums associated with that business may increase or decrease (renewal premium change) as a result
of increases or decreases in rate and/or insured exposures, which the Company considers as a measure
of units of exposure (such as the number and value of vehicles or properties insured). Net written
premiums from both renewal and new business, and therefore earned premiums, are impacted by
competitive market conditions as well as general economic conditions, which, particularly in the case of
Business Insurance, affect audit premium adjustments, policy endorsements and mid-term cancellations.
Property and casualty insurance market conditions are expected to remain competitive. Net written
premiums may also be impacted by the structure of reinsurance programs and related costs, as well as
changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

Overall, the Company expects retention levels (the amount of expiring premium that renews,

before the impact of renewal premium changes) will remain strong by historical standards during 2018.
In Business Insurance, the Company expects that domestic renewal premium changes during 2018 will
remain positive and will be higher than the levels attained in 2017. In Bond & Specialty Insurance, the
Company expects that renewal premium changes with respect to domestic management liability business
during 2018 will remain positive and will be broadly consistent with the levels attained in 2017. With
respect to domestic surety business within Bond & Specialty Insurance, the Company expects that net
written premium volume during 2018 will be slightly higher than in 2017. In Personal Insurance, the
Company expects that domestic Agency Auto renewal premium changes will be positive and broadly
consistent with the levels attained in 2017. The Company expects domestic Agency Auto renewal
premium changes will be higher in the first half of 2018 and lower in the second half of 2018 compared
with the same periods of 2017. The Company expects that domestic Agency Homeowners and Other
renewal premium changes during 2018 will remain positive and will be slightly higher than the levels
attained in 2017. The need for state regulatory approval for changes to personal property and casualty
insurance prices, as well as competitive market conditions, may impact the timing and extent of renewal
premium changes. Given the relatively smaller amount of premium that the Company generates from
outside the United States and the transactional nature of some of those markets, particularly Lloyd’s,
international renewal premium changes in each segment during 2018 could be somewhat higher,
broadly consistent with or somewhat lower than the levels attained in 2017.

Property and casualty insurance market conditions are expected to remain competitive during 2018

for new business. In each of the Company’s business segments, new business generally has less of an
impact on underwriting profitability than renewal business, given the volume of new business relative to
renewal business. However, in periods of meaningful increases in new business, despite its positive
impact on underwriting gains over time, the impact of higher new business levels may negatively impact
the combined ratio for a period of time.

Economic conditions in the United States and elsewhere could change, due to a variety of factors,

including the political and regulatory environment, the U.S. Federal budget and further potential
changes in tax laws in the United States, the repeal, replacement or modification of the Affordable
Care Act, the imposition of tariffs or other barriers to international trade, the United Kingdom’s

115

withdrawal from the European Union, rapid changes in commodity prices and fluctuations in interest
rates and foreign currency exchange rates. The resulting changes in levels of economic activity could
positively or negatively impact exposure changes at renewal and the Company’s ability to write business
at acceptable rates. Additionally, changes in levels of economic activity could positively or negatively
impact audit premium adjustments, policy endorsements and mid-term cancellations after policies are
written. All of the foregoing, in turn, could positively or negatively impact net written premiums during
2018, and because earned premiums are a function of net written premiums, earned premiums could be
impacted on a lagging basis.

Underwriting Gain/Loss. The Company’s underwriting gain/loss can be significantly impacted by

catastrophe losses and net favorable or unfavorable prior year reserve development, as well as
underlying underwriting margins.

Catastrophe losses and non-catastrophe weather-related losses are inherently unpredictable from

period to period. The Company’s results of operations could be adversely impacted if significant
catastrophe and non-catastrophe weather-related losses were to occur.

For a number of years, the Company’s results have included significant amounts of net favorable

prior year reserve development driven by better than expected loss experience. However, given the
inherent uncertainty in estimating claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, loss experience could
develop such that the Company recognizes higher or lower levels of favorable prior year reserve
development, no favorable prior year reserve development or unfavorable prior year reserve
development in future periods. In addition, the ongoing review of prior year claims and claim
adjustment expense reserves, or other changes in current period circumstances, may result in the
Company revising current year loss estimates upward or downward in future periods of the current
year.

It is possible that changes in economic conditions could lead to higher inflation than the Company

had anticipated, which could in turn lead to an increase in the Company’s loss costs and the need to
strengthen claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. These impacts of inflation on loss costs and
claims and claim adjustment expense reserves could be more pronounced for those lines of business
that require a relatively longer period of time to finalize and settle claims for a given accident year and,
accordingly, are relatively more inflation sensitive. For a further discussion, see ‘‘Part I—Item 1A—Risk
Factors—If actual claims exceed our claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, or if changes in the
estimated level of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves are necessary, including as a result of,
among other things, changes in the legal, regulatory and economic environments in which the Company
operates, our financial results could be materially and adversely affected.’’

In Business Insurance, the Company expects underlying underwriting margins in 2018 will be

higher than in 2017, and the underlying combined ratio will be slightly lower than in 2017, assuming
lower (and more normalized) levels of non-catastrophe weather-related losses and other loss activity.
In Bond & Specialty Insurance, the Company expects that underlying underwriting margins and

the underlying combined ratio for the first nine months of 2018 will be broadly consistent with the
same period of 2017, and in the last quarter of 2018, the Company expects that underlying underwriting
margins will be higher and the underlying combined ratio will be lower than in the same period
of 2017.

In Personal Insurance, the Company expects underlying underwriting margins in 2018 will be

higher than in 2017, and the underlying combined ratio will be slightly lower than in 2017. In Agency
Automobile, the Company expects that underlying underwriting margins and the underlying combined
ratio will improve during 2018 compared with 2017, reflecting actions taken to improve profitability. In
Agency Homeowners and Other, the Company expects that underlying underwriting margins and the
underlying combined ratio in 2018 will be broadly consistent with 2017, assuming lower (and more
normalized) levels of non-catastrophe weather-related losses and other loss activity.

116

Income Taxes. As a result of the decrease in the corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to

21% due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) in December 2017, the Company’s
effective tax rate will decline in 2018. The Company expects its 2018 results of operations will benefit
from the impact of that rate change. Under current GAAP reporting guidance, there is potential
variability in the Company’s effective tax rate due to the manner in which changes in corporate tax
rates are reported on items reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), particularly
the tax related to unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturity securities. In February 2018, the FASB
issued new accounting guidance to address the effects of the change in tax rates in the TCJA on items
reported in AOCI; however, the new guidance is only applicable to changes resulting from the
enactment of the TCJA and does not apply to future changes in tax laws and rates.

Investment Portfolio. The Company expects to continue to focus its investment strategy on

maintaining a high-quality investment portfolio and a relatively short average effective duration. The
weighted average effective duration of fixed maturities and short-term securities was 4.0 (4.3 excluding
short-term securities) at December 31, 2017. From time to time, the Company enters into short
positions in U.S. Treasury futures contracts to manage the duration of its fixed maturity portfolio. At
December 31, 2017, the Company had $400 million notional value of open U.S. Treasury futures
contracts. The Company continually evaluates its investment alternatives and mix. Currently, the
majority of the Company’s investments are comprised of a widely diversified portfolio of high-quality,
liquid, taxable U.S. government, tax-exempt U.S. municipal and taxable corporate and U.S. agency
mortgage-backed bonds.

The Company also invests much smaller amounts in equity securities, real estate, private equity
limited partnerships, hedge funds, and real estate partnerships and joint ventures. These investment
classes have the potential for higher returns but also the potential for higher degrees of risk, including
less stable rates of return and less liquidity.

Net investment income is a material contributor to the Company’s results of operations. Based on
the impacts of (i) the lower federal corporate income tax rate in 2018, (ii) slightly higher levels of fixed
maturities and (iii) higher short-term investment yields, partially offset by the impact of (iv) expected
lower reinvestment yields on fixed maturity investments, the Company expects that during 2018,
after-tax net investment income from those portfolios will be approximately $25 million to $30 million
higher on a quarterly basis as compared to the corresponding quarters of 2017. The impact of future
market conditions on net investment income from the non-fixed maturity investment portfolio during
2018 is hard to predict. If general economic conditions and/or investment market conditions change
during 2018, the Company could experience an increase or decrease in net investment income and/or
significant realized investment gains or losses (including impairments).

The Company had a net pre-tax unrealized investment gain of $1.38 billion ($1.09 billion after-tax)
in its fixed maturity investment portfolio at December 31, 2017. While the Company does not attempt
to predict future interest rate movements, a rising interest rate environment would reduce the market
value of fixed maturity investments and, therefore, reduce shareholders’ equity, and a declining interest
rate environment would have the opposite effects. The Company’s investment portfolio has benefited
from certain tax exemptions (primarily those related to interest from municipal bonds) and certain
other tax laws, including, but not limited to, those governing dividends-received deductions and tax
credits (such as foreign tax credits). Changes in these laws could adversely impact the value of the
Company’s investment portfolio. See ‘‘Changes in U.S. tax laws or in the tax laws of other jurisdictions
in which we operate could adversely impact us’’ included in ‘‘Part I—Item 1A—Risk Factors.’’

In 2017, the Company had net pre-tax realized investment gains of $216 million, which were

primarily driven by gains on sales of equity securities. Pursuant to updated FASB guidance and
beginning January 1, 2018, the Company’s equity securities, except those accounted for under the
equity method of accounting, that have readily determinable fair value will be measured at fair value

117

with changes in fair value recognized as part of net realized investment gains in net income. At
December 31, 2017, the carrying value of the Company’s equity securities was $453 million, which
included $13 million of net pre-tax unrealized investment gains. The Company currently expects that
net pre-tax realized investment gains related to equity securities in 2018, if any, will be lower than in
2017.

discussion of the risks to the Company’s business during or following a financial market disruption and
risks to the Company’s investment portfolio, see the risk factors entitled ‘‘During or following a period
of financial market disruption or an economic downturn, our business could be materially and adversely
affected’’ and ‘‘Our investment portfolio is subject to credit and interest rate risk, and may suffer
reduced returns or material realized or unrealized losses’’ included in ‘‘Part I—Item 1A—Risk Factors.’’
For a discussion of the risks to the Company’s investments from foreign currency exchange rate
fluctuations, see the risk factor entitled ‘‘We are also subject to a number of additional risks associated
with our business outside the United States’’ included in ‘‘Part I—Item 1A—Risk Factors’’ and see
‘‘Part II—Item 7A—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk—Foreign Currency
Exchange Rate Risk.’’

Capital Position. The Company believes it has a strong capital position and, as part of its ongoing

efforts to create shareholder value, expects to continue to return capital not needed to support its
business operations to its shareholders. The Company expects that, generally over time, the
combination of dividends to common shareholders and common share repurchases will likely not
exceed net income. In addition, the timing and actual number of shares to be repurchased in the future
will depend on a variety of additional factors, including the Company’s financial position, earnings,
share price, catastrophe losses, maintaining capital levels commensurate with the Company’s desired
ratings from independent rating agencies, funding of the Company’s qualified pension plan, capital
requirements of the Company’s operating subsidiaries, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, other
investment opportunities (including mergers and acquisitions and related financings), market conditions
and other factors. For information regarding the Company’s common share repurchases in 2017, see
‘‘Liquidity and Capital Resources.’’

As a result of the Company’s business outside of the United States, primarily in Canada, the

United Kingdom (including Lloyd’s), the Republic of Ireland and Brazil, the Company’s capital is also
subject to the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. For example, strengthening of the
U.S. dollar in comparison to other currencies could result in a reduction of shareholders’ equity. For
additional discussion of the Company’s foreign exchange market risk exposure, see ‘‘Part II—Item 7A—
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.’’

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Liquidity is a measure of a company’s ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash

requirements of its business operations and to satisfy general corporate purposes when needed.

Operating Company Liquidity. The liquidity requirements of the Company’s insurance subsidiaries

are met primarily by funds generated from premiums, fees, income received on investments and
investment maturities. Cash provided from these sources is used primarily for claims and claim
adjustment expense payments and operating expenses. The insurance subsidiaries’ liquidity
requirements can be impacted by, among other factors, the timing and amount of catastrophe claims,
which are inherently unpredictable, as well as the timing and amount of reinsurance recoveries, which
may be affected by reinsurer solvency and reinsurance coverage disputes. Additionally, the variability of
asbestos-related claim payments, as well as the volatility of potential judgments and settlements arising
out of litigation, may also result in increased liquidity requirements. It is the opinion of the Company’s
management that the insurance subsidiaries’ future liquidity needs will be adequately met from all of
the sources described above. Subject to restrictions imposed by states in which the Company’s insurance
subsidiaries are domiciled, the Company’s principal insurance subsidiaries pay dividends to their
respective parent companies, which, in turn, pay dividends to the corporate holding (parent) company
(TRV). For further information regarding restrictions on dividends paid by the Company’s insurance
subsidiaries, see ‘‘Part I—Item 1—Regulation.’’

Holding Company Liquidity. TRV’s liquidity requirements primarily include shareholder dividends,

debt servicing, common share repurchases and, from time to time, contributions to its qualified
domestic pension plan. At December 31, 2017, TRV held total cash and short-term invested assets in
the United States aggregating $1.27 billion and having a weighted average maturity of 71 days. TRV
has established a holding company liquidity target equal to its estimated annual pre-tax interest expense
and common shareholder dividends (currently approximately $1.1 billion). TRV’s holding company
liquidity of $1.27 billion at December 31, 2017 exceeded this target and it is the opinion of the
Company’s management that these assets are sufficient to meet TRV’s current liquidity requirements.
TRV is not dependent on dividends or other forms of repatriation from its foreign operations to

support its liquidity needs. The undistributed earnings of the Company’s foreign operations are
intended to be permanently reinvested in those operations, and such earnings were not material to the
Company’s financial position or liquidity at December 31, 2017.

TRV has a shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission that

expires on June 17, 2019 which permits it to issue securities from time to time. TRV also has a
$1.0 billion line of credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions that expires on June 7, 2018.
This line of credit also supports TRV’s $800 million commercial paper program. At December 31, 2017,
the Company had $100 million of commercial paper outstanding. TRV is not reliant on its commercial
paper program to meet its operating cash flow needs.

The Company utilized uncollateralized letters of credit issued by major banks with an aggregate

limit of approximately $347 million to provide a portion of the capital needed to support its obligations
at Lloyd’s at December 31, 2017. If uncollateralized letters of credit are not available at a reasonable
price or at all in the future, the Company can collateralize these letters of credit or may have to seek
alternative means of supporting its obligations at Lloyd’s, which could include utilizing holding company
funds on hand.

On August 4, 2017, the Company completed its previously announced acquisition of all issued and

outstanding shares of Simply Business Holdings Ltd (Simply Business), a leading provider of small
business insurance policies in the United Kingdom, for a purchase price of approximately $464 million,
which included the repayment of debt and other obligations of Simply Business. In addition, the
Company issued 95,953 shares of restricted common stock valued at approximately $12 million to

119

certain employees of Simply Business who were equity holders of Simply Business. The Company used
a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of senior notes in May 2017 (described in more detail
in note 8 of notes to the consolidated financial statements) and internal resources to fund this
transaction.

Operating Activities

Net cash flows provided by operating activities were $3.76 billion, $4.20 billion and $3.43 billion in

2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in cash flows in 2017 reflected higher levels of
payments for claims and claim adjustment expenses, the inclusion in 2016 of proceeds from the
settlement of a reinsurance dispute as discussed in more detail in note 16 of notes to the consolidated
financial statements, higher commission expenses and a higher discretionary contribution to the
Company’s U.S. qualified non-contributory defined benefit pension plan, partially offset by higher levels
of collected premiums and lower income tax payments. The higher level of payments for claims and
claim adjustment expenses in 2017 included the impact of increased business volumes and a higher
level of catastrophe losses, partially offset by the inclusion in 2016 of the Company’s $524 million
payment related to the settlement of the PPG Industries, Inc. litigation as described in more detail in
the ‘‘Asbestos Claims and Litigation’’ section. The increase in cash flows in 2016 reflected higher levels
of collected premiums, proceeds from the settlement of a reinsurance dispute discussed above and
lower income tax payments, partially offset by higher levels of payments for claims and claim
adjustment expenses, general and administrative expenses and commission expenses. The higher level of
payments for claims and claim adjustment expenses in 2016 included the Company’s $524 million
payment related to the settlement of the PPG Industries, Inc. litigation discussed above. Cash flows in
2015 included the Company’s $579 million payment related to the Direct Action Settlements and a
lower level of net investment income, partially offset by a higher level of collected premiums and a
lower contribution to the Company’s qualified domestic pension plan. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, the
Company voluntarily made contributions totaling $300 million, $200 million and $100 million,
respectively, to its qualified domestic pension plan. The qualified domestic pension plan was 108% and
101% funded at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities was $1.82 billion and $1.46 billion in 2017 and 2016,

respectively, compared with net cash provided by investing activities of $317 million in 2015. The
Company’s consolidated total investments at December 31, 2017 increased by $2.01 billion, or 3% over
year-end 2016, primarily reflecting the impacts of net cash flows provided by operating activities and an
increase in the unrealized appreciation of investments, partially offset by common share repurchases,
dividends paid to shareholders and the cost of acquiring Simply Business. The Company’s consolidated
total investments at December 31, 2016 increased by $18 million, or less than 1% from year-end 2015,
primarily reflecting net cash flows provided by operating activities, largely offset by common share
repurchases, a decrease in the unrealized appreciation of investments and dividends paid to
shareholders.

The Company’s investment portfolio is managed to support its insurance operations; accordingly,

the portfolio is positioned to meet obligations to policyholders. As such, the primary goals of the
Company’s asset-liability management process are to satisfy the insurance liabilities and maintain
sufficient liquidity to cover fluctuations in projected liability cash flows. Generally, the expected
principal and interest payments produced by the Company’s fixed maturity portfolio adequately fund
the estimated runoff of the Company’s insurance reserves. Although this is not an exact cash flow
match in each period, the substantial amount by which the market value of the fixed maturity portfolio
exceeds the value of the net insurance liabilities, as well as the positive cash flow from newly sold

120

policies and the large amount of high quality liquid bonds, contributes to the Company’s ability to fund
claim payments without having to sell illiquid assets or access credit facilities.

Financing Activities

Net cash flows used in financing activities were $1.92 billion, $2.81 billion and $3.73 billion in 2017,

2016 and 2015, respectively. The totals in each year primarily reflected common share repurchases,
dividends paid to shareholders and the payment of debt, partially offset by the issuance of debt and
proceeds from employee stock option exercises. Common share repurchases in 2017, 2016 and 2015
were $1.44 billion, $2.47 billion and $3.22 billion, respectively.

Debt Transactions.

2017. On May 22, 2017, the Company issued $700 million aggregate principal amount of 4.00%

senior notes that will mature on May 30, 2047. The net proceeds of the issuance, after the deduction of
the underwriting discount and expenses payable by the Company, totaled approximately $689 million.
Interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on May 30 and November 30. Prior to
November 30, 2046, the senior notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at the Company’s option,
at any time or from time to time, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (a) 100% of the
principal amount of any senior notes to be redeemed or (b) the sum of the present values of the
remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to November 30, 2046 on any senior notes to
be redeemed (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the date of
redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the
then current Treasury rate (as defined in the senior notes), plus 15 basis points. On or after
November 30, 2046, the senior notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at the Company’s option,
at any time or from time to time, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of any
senior notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.
On June 2, 2017, the Company redeemed the remaining $107 million aggregate principal amount

of its 6.25% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2067 at a price per debenture
of 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. On
December 15, 2017, the Company’s $450 million, 5.75% senior notes matured and were fully paid.

2016. On May 11, 2016, the Company issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75%

senior notes that will mature on May 15, 2046. The net proceeds of the issuance, after the deduction of
underwriting and other expenses, totaled approximately $491 million. Interest on the senior notes is
payable semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15. Prior to November 15, 2045, the senior
notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at the Company’s option, at any time or from time to
time, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (a) 100% of the principal amount of any senior
notes to be redeemed or (b) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of
principal and interest on any senior notes to be redeemed (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of
redemption) discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year
consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the then current Treasury Rate (as defined in the senior notes),
plus 20 basis points. On or after November 15, 2045, the senior notes may be redeemed, in whole or in
part, at the Company’s option, at any time or from time to time, at a redemption price equal to 100%
of the principal amount of any senior notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but
excluding, the redemption date.

On June 20, 2016, the Company’s $400 million, 6.25% senior notes matured and were fully paid.

2015. On August 25, 2015, the Company issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of 4.30%

senior notes that will mature on August 25, 2045. The net proceeds of the issuance, after original
issuance discount and the deduction of underwriting expenses and commissions and other expenses,
totaled approximately $392 million. Interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on

121

February 25 and August 25. Prior to February 25, 2045, the senior notes may be redeemed, in whole or
in part, at the Company’s option, at any time or from time to time, at a redemption price equal to the
greater of (a) 100% of the principal amount of any senior notes to be redeemed or (b) the sum of the
present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on any senior notes to be
redeemed (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the date of
redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the
then current Treasury Rate (as defined in the senior notes), plus 25 basis points. On or after
February 25, 2045, the senior notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at the Company’s option, at
any time or from time to time, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of any
senior notes to be redeemed.

On December 1, 2015, the Company’s $400 million, 5.50% senior notes matured and were fully

paid.

Dividends. Dividends paid to shareholders were $785 million, $757 million and $739 million in
2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of the
Company’s common stock will be at the discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors and will
depend upon many factors, including the Company’s financial position, earnings, capital requirements
of the Company’s operating subsidiaries, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors as
the Board of Directors deems relevant. Dividends will be paid by the Company only if declared by its
Board of Directors out of funds legally available, subject to any other restrictions that may be
applicable to the Company. On January 23, 2018, the Company announced that its Board of Directors
declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.72 per share, payable March 30, 2018, to shareholders of
record on March 9, 2018.

Share Repurchases. The Company’s Board of Directors has approved common share repurchase
authorizations under which repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market, pursuant
to pre-set trading plans meeting the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, in private transactions or otherwise. The authorizations do not have a stated expiration date. The
timing and actual number of shares to be repurchased in the future will depend on a variety of factors,
including the Company’s financial position, earnings, share price, catastrophe losses, maintaining capital
levels commensurate with the Company’s desired ratings from independent rating agencies, funding of
the Company’s qualified pension plan, capital requirements of the Company’s operating subsidiaries,
legal requirements, regulatory constraints, other investment opportunities (including mergers and
acquisitions and related financings), market conditions and other factors. In April 2017, the Board of
Directors approved a share repurchase authorization that added an additional $5.0 billion of repurchase
capacity. The following table summarizes repurchase activity in 2017 and remaining repurchase capacity
at December 31, 2017.

From the inception of the first authorization on May 2, 2006 through December 31, 2017, the

Company has repurchased a cumulative total of 487.7 million shares for a total cost of $31.44 billion, or
an average of $64.48 per share.

122

In 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company acquired 0.5 million, 0.6 million and 0.7 million shares,

respectively, of common stock from employees as treasury stock primarily to cover payroll withholding
taxes in connection with the vesting of restricted stock unit awards and performance share awards, and
shares used by employees to cover the price of certain stock options that were exercised.

Capital Resources

Capital resources reflect the overall financial strength of the Company and its ability to borrow

funds at competitive rates and raise new capital to meet its needs. The following table summarizes the

Total capitalization at December 31, 2017 was $30.30 billion, $644 million higher than at

December 31, 2016, primarily reflecting the impacts of net income of $2.06 billion, an increase in
accumulated other comprehensive income of $412 million due to changes in unrealized appreciation on
investments and unrealized foreign currency translation, proceeds from the exercise of employee share
options of $173 million and an increase in debt outstanding of $134 million, partially offset by common
share repurchases totaling $1.38 billion under the Company’s share repurchase authorization and
shareholder dividends of $789 million.

The following table provides a reconciliation of total capitalization to total capitalization excluding

net unrealized gains on investments, net of taxes, included in shareholders’ equity:

The debt-to-total capital ratio excluding net unrealized gain on investments, net of taxes, included

in shareholders’ equity, is calculated by dividing (a) debt by (b) total capitalization excluding net
unrealized gains and losses on investments, net of taxes, included in shareholders’ equity. Net
unrealized gains and losses on investments can be significantly impacted by both interest rate

123

movements and other economic factors. Accordingly, in the opinion of the Company’s management, the
debt-to-total capital ratio calculated on this basis provides another useful metric for investors to
understand the Company’s financial leverage position. The Company’s ratio of debt-to-total capital
excluding after-tax net unrealized investment gains included in shareholders’ equity of 22.5% at
December 31, 2017 was within the Company’s target range of 15% to 25%.

Credit Agreement. The Company is a party to a five-year, $1.0 billion revolving credit agreement

with a syndicate of financial institutions that expires on June 7, 2018. Terms of the credit agreement are
discussed in more detail in note 8 of notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Shelf Registration. The Company has filed a universal shelf registration statement with the

Securities and Exchange Commission that expires on June 17, 2019 for the potential offering and sale
of securities. The Company may offer these securities from time to time at prices and on other terms
to be determined at the time of offering.

Share Repurchase Authorization. At December 31, 2017, the Company had $4.56 billion of
capacity remaining under its share repurchase authorization approved by the Board of Directors.

Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes, as of December 31, 2017, the Company’s future payments under

contractual obligations and estimated claims and claim-related payments. The table excludes short-term
obligations and includes only liabilities at December 31, 2017 that are expected to be settled in cash.

The table below includes the amount and estimated future timing of claims and claim-related

payments. The amounts do not represent the exact liability, but instead represent estimates, generally
utilizing actuarial projection techniques, at a given accounting date. These estimates include
expectations of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost based on the
Company’s assessment of facts and circumstances known, review of historical settlement patterns,
estimates of trends in claims severity, frequency, legal theories of liability and other factors. Variables in
the reserve estimation process can be affected by both internal and external events, such as changes in
claims handling procedures, economic inflation or deflation, legal trends and legislative changes. Many
of these items are not directly quantifiable, particularly on a prospective basis. Additionally, there may
be significant reporting lags between the occurrence of the policyholder event and the time it is actually
reported to the insurer. The future cash flows related to the items contained in the table below
required estimation of both amount (including severity considerations) and timing. Amount and timing
are frequently estimated separately. An estimation of both amount and timing of future cash flows
related to claims and claim-related payments has unavoidable estimation uncertainty.

(1) See note 8 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of outstanding
indebtedness. Because the amounts reported in the foregoing table include principal and interest,
the total long-term debt obligations will not agree with the amounts reported in note 8.

(2) Represents agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business to lease office space,

equipment and furniture. Future sublease rental income aggregating approximately $4 million will
partially offset these commitments.

(3) Includes agreements with vendors to purchase system software administration and maintenance

services.

(4) Includes commitments to vendors entered into in the ordinary course of business for goods and

services including property, plant and equipment, office supplies, archival services, etc.

(5) Represents estimated timing for fulfilling unfunded commitments for private equity limited

partnerships and real estate partnerships.

(6) The amounts in ‘‘Claims and claim adjustment expenses’’ in the table above represent the

expected to be paid by annuity companies.
The Company has entered into reinsurance agreements to manage its exposure to losses and
protect its capital as described in note 5 of notes to the consolidated financial statements.
In order to qualify for reinsurance accounting, a reinsurance agreement must indemnify the insurer
from insurance risk, i.e., the agreement must transfer amount and timing risk. Since the timing and
amount of cash inflows from such reinsurance agreements are directly related to the underlying
payment of claims and claim adjustment expenses by the insurer, reinsurance recoverables are
recognized in a manner consistent with the liabilities (the estimated liability for claims and claim
adjustment expenses) relating to the underlying reinsured contracts. The presence of any feature
that can delay timely reimbursement of claims by a reinsurer results in the reinsurance contract
being accounted for as a deposit rather than reinsurance. The assumptions used in estimating the
amount and timing of the reinsurance recoverables are consistent with those used in estimating the
amount and timing of the related liabilities.
The estimated future cash inflows from the Company’s reinsurance contracts that qualify for
reinsurance accounting are as follows:

For business underwritten by non-U.S. operations, future cash flows related to reported and
unreported claims incurred and related claim adjustment expenses were translated at the spot rate
on December 31, 2017.
The amounts reported in the table above and in the table of reinsurance recoverables above are
presented on a nominal basis and have not been adjusted to reflect the time value of money.
Accordingly, the amounts above will differ from the Company’s balance sheet to the extent that
the liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses and the related reinsurance recoverables
have been discounted in the balance sheet. See note 1 of notes to the consolidated financial
statements.

(7) Workers’ compensation large deductible policies provide third-party coverage in which the

Company typically is responsible for paying the entire loss under such policies and then seeks
reimbursement from the insured for the deductible amount. ‘‘Claims from large deductible
policies’’ represent the estimated future payment for claims and claim related expenses below the
deductible amount, net of the estimated recovery of the deductible. The liability and the related
deductible receivable for unpaid claims are presented in the consolidated balance sheet as
‘‘contractholder payables’’ and ‘‘contractholder receivables,’’ respectively. Most deductibles for such
policies are paid directly from the policyholder’s escrow, which is periodically replenished by the
policyholder. The payment of the loss amounts above the deductible are reported within ‘‘Claims
and claim adjustment expenses’’ in the above table. Because the timing of the collection of the
deductible (contractholder receivables) occurs shortly after the payment of the deductible to a
claimant (contractholder payables), these cash flows offset each other in the table.

(8) The amounts in ‘‘Loss-based assessments’’ relate to estimated future payments of second-injury

fund assessments which would result from payment of current claim liabilities. Second injury funds
cover the cost of any additional benefits for aggravation of a pre-existing condition. For loss-based
assessments, the cost is shared by the insurance industry and self-insureds, funded through
assessments to insurance companies and self-insureds based on losses. Amounts relating to second-
injury fund assessments are included in ‘‘other liabilities’’ in the consolidated balance sheet.

(9) The amounts in ‘‘Reinsurance contracts accounted for as deposits’’ represent estimated future

nominal payments for reinsurance agreements that are accounted for as deposits. Amounts payable
under deposit agreements are included in ‘‘other liabilities’’ in the consolidated balance sheet.

(10) The amounts in ‘‘Payout from ceded funds withheld’’ represent estimated payments for losses and

return of funds held related to certain reinsurance arrangements whereby the Company holds a
portion of the premium due to the reinsurer and is allowed to pay claims from the amounts held.
(11) The Company’s current liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits from uncertain tax positions
are $230 million. Offsetting these liabilities are deferred tax assets of $207 million associated with
the temporary differences that would exist if these positions become realized.
The above table does not include an analysis of liabilities reported for structured settlements for
which the Company has purchased annuities and remains contingently liable in the event of default by
the company issuing the annuity. The Company is not reasonably likely to incur material future
payment obligations under such agreements. In addition, the Company is not currently subject to any
minimum funding requirements for its qualified pension plan. Accordingly, future contributions are not
included in the foregoing table.

Dividend Availability

The Company’s principal insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in the State of Connecticut. The

insurance holding company laws of Connecticut applicable to the Company’s subsidiaries requires
notice to, and approval by, the state insurance commissioner for the declaration or payment of any
dividend that, together with other distributions made within the preceding twelve months, exceeds the
greater of 10% of the insurer’s statutory capital and surplus as of the preceding December 31, or the
insurer’s net income for the twelve-month period ending the preceding December 31, in each case
determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices and by state regulation. This declaration
or payment is further limited by adjusted unassigned surplus, as determined in accordance with
statutory accounting practices. The insurance holding company laws of other states in which the
Company’s subsidiaries are domiciled generally contain similar, although in some instances somewhat
more restrictive, limitations on the payment of dividends. A maximum of $2.66 billion is available by
the end of 2018 for such dividends to the holding company, TRV, without prior approval of the
Connecticut Insurance Department. The Company may choose to accelerate the timing within 2018
and/or increase the amount of dividends from its insurance subsidiaries in 2018, which could result in
certain dividends being subject to approval by the Connecticut Insurance Department.

In addition to the regulatory restrictions on the availability of dividends that can be paid by the

Company’s U.S. insurance subsidiaries, the maximum amount of dividends that may be paid to the
Company’s shareholders is limited, to a lesser degree, by certain covenants contained in its line of
credit agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions that require the Company to maintain a

127

minimum consolidated net worth as described in note 8 of notes to the consolidated financial
statements.

TRV is not dependent on dividends or other forms of repatriation from its foreign operations to

support its liquidity needs. The undistributed earnings of the Company’s foreign operations are
intended to be permanently reinvested in those operations, and such earnings were not material to the
Company’s financial position or liquidity at December 31, 2017.

TRV and its two non-insurance holding company subsidiaries received dividends of $2.33 billion,

$3.05 billion and $3.75 billion from their U.S. insurance subsidiaries in 2017, 2016 and 2015,
respectively.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

The Company sponsors a qualified non-contributory defined benefit pension plan (the Qualified
Plan), which covers substantially all U.S. domestic employees and provides benefits primarily under a
cash balance formula. In addition, the Company sponsors a nonqualified defined benefit pension plan
which covers certain highly-compensated employees, pension plans for employees of its foreign
subsidiaries, and a postretirement health and life insurance benefit plan for employees satisfying certain
age and service requirements and for certain retirees.

The Qualified Plan is subject to regulations under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act

of 1974 as amended (ERISA), which requires plans to meet minimum standards of funding and
requires such plans to subscribe to plan termination insurance through the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation (PBGC). The Company does not have a minimum funding requirement for the Qualified
Plan for 2018 and does not anticipate having a minimum funding requirement in 2019. The Company
has significant discretion in making contributions above those necessary to satisfy the minimum funding
requirements. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, there was no minimum funding requirement for the Qualified
Plan. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company voluntarily made contributions totaling $300 million,
$200 million and $100 million, respectively, to the Qualified Plan. Based on its funded status at
December 31, 2017, the Company does not currently anticipate making a voluntary contribution to the
Qualified Plan in 2018. In determining future contributions, the Company will consider the
performance of the plan’s investment portfolio, the effects of interest rates on the projected benefit
obligation of the plan and the Company’s other capital requirements.

In 2016, the Company began using a full yield-curve approach in the estimation of the service and

interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs for its qualified and nonqualified domestic
pension plans and its domestic postretirement benefit plans. For a full discussion of the rationale and
impact of this change in approach, see note 14 of notes to the consolidated financial statements.

The Qualified Plan assets are managed to maximize long-term total return while maintaining an
appropriate level of risk. The Company’s overall strategy is to achieve a mix of approximately 85% to
90% of investments for long-term growth and 10% to 15% for near-term benefit payments with a
diversification of asset types, fund strategies and fund managers. The current target allocations for plan
assets are 55% to 65% equity securities and 20% to 40% fixed income securities, with the remainder
allocated to short-term securities. For 2018, the Company plans to apply an expected long-term rate of
return on plan assets of 7.00%, the same rate that was applied in 2017. The expected rate of return
reflects the Company’s current expectations with regard to long-term returns in the capital markets,
taking into account the pension plan’s asset allocation targets, the historical performance and current
valuation of U.S. and international equities, and the level of long term interest rate and inflation
expectations. The Company’s expected long-term rate of return on plan assets also contemplates a
return to more normal levels of long-term interest rates in the future.

128

For further discussion of the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, see note 14 of notes

to the consolidated financial statements.

Risk-Based Capital

The NAIC has an RBC requirement for most property and casualty insurance companies, which

determines minimum capital requirements and is intended to raise the level of protection for
policyholder obligations. The Company’s U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to these NAIC RBC
requirements based on laws that have been adopted by individual states. These requirements subject
insurers having policyholders’ surplus less than that required by the RBC calculation to varying degrees
of regulatory action, depending on the level of capital inadequacy. Each of the Company’s U.S.
insurance subsidiaries had policyholders’ surplus at December 31, 2017 significantly above the level at
which any RBC regulatory action would occur. Regulators in the jurisdictions in which the Company’s
foreign insurance subsidiaries are located require insurance companies to maintain certain levels of
capital depending on, among other things, the type and amount of insurance policies in force. Each of
the Company’s foreign insurance subsidiaries had capital significantly above their respective regulatory
requirements at December 31, 2017.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

The Company has entered into certain contingent obligations for guarantees related to selling

businesses to third parties, certain investments, third-party loans related to certain investments, certain
insurance policy obligations of former insurance subsidiaries and various other indemnifications. See
note 16 of notes to the consolidated financial statements. The Company does not expect these
arrangements will have a material effect on the Company’s financial position, changes in financial
position, revenues and expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital
resources.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The Company considers its most significant accounting estimates to be those applied to claims and

claim adjustment expense reserves and related reinsurance recoverables, investment valuation and
impairments, and goodwill and other intangible assets impairments.

The $1.70 billion increase in gross claims and claim adjustment expense reserves since

December 31, 2016 primarily reflected the impacts of (i) catastrophe losses incurred in the second half
of 2017 and (ii) higher volumes of insured exposures and loss cost trends for the current accident year,
partially offset by the impacts of (iii) payments related to operations in runoff and (iv) net favorable
prior year reserve development.

Asbestos and environmental reserves are included in the General liability, Commercial multi-peril
and International and other lines in the foregoing summary table. Asbestos and environmental reserves
are discussed separately; see ‘‘Asbestos Claims and Litigation’’, ‘‘Environmental Claims and Litigation’’
and ‘‘Uncertainty Regarding Adequacy of Asbestos and Environmental Reserves.’’

Claims and claim adjustment expense reserves represent management’s estimate of the ultimate
liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for claims that have been reported and claims
that have been incurred but not yet reported (IBNR) as of the balance sheet date. Claims and claim
adjustment expense reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability, but instead represent
management estimates, primarily utilizing actuarial expertise and projection methods. These estimates
are expectations of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost upon final
resolution in the future, based on the Company’s assessment of facts and circumstances then known,
review of historical settlement patterns, estimates of trends in claims severity and frequency, expected
interpretations of legal theories of liability and other factors. In establishing gross claims and claim
adjustment expense reserves, the Company also considers salvage and subrogation. Estimated recoveries
from reinsurance are included in ‘‘Reinsurance Recoverables’’ as an asset on the Company’s
consolidated balance sheet. The claims and claim adjustment expense reserves are reviewed regularly by
qualified actuaries employed by the Company.

The process of estimating claims and claim adjustment expense reserves involves a high degree of
judgment and is subject to a number of variables. These variables can be affected by both internal and
external events, such as changes in claims handling procedures, changes in individuals involved in the
reserve estimation process, economic inflation, legal trends and legislative changes, among others. The
impact of many of these items on ultimate costs for claims and claim adjustment expenses is difficult to
estimate. Estimation difficulties also differ significantly by product line due to differences in claim
complexity, the volume of claims, the potential severity of individual claims, the determination of
occurrence date for a claim and reporting lags (the time between the occurrence of the policyholder
event and when it is actually reported to the insurer). Informed judgment is applied throughout the
process, including the application of various individual experiences and expertise to multiple sets of
data and analyses. The Company continually refines its estimates in a regular ongoing process as
historical loss experience develops and additional claims are reported and settled. The Company
rigorously attempts to consider all significant facts and circumstances known at the time claims and
claim adjustment expense reserves are established. Due to the inherent uncertainty underlying these
estimates including, but not limited to, the future settlement environment, final resolution of the
estimated liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses may be higher or lower than the related
claims and claim adjustment expense reserves at the reporting date. Therefore, actual paid losses, as
claims are settled in the future, may be materially different than the amount currently recorded—
favorable or unfavorable.

Because establishment of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves is an inherently uncertain

process involving estimates, currently established claims and claim adjustment expense reserves may
change. The Company reflects adjustments to the reserves in the results of operations in the period the
estimates are changed.

There are also additional risks which impact the estimation of ultimate costs for catastrophes. For
example, the estimation of reserves related to hurricanes, tornadoes and other catastrophic events can
be affected by the inability of the Company and its insureds to access portions of the impacted areas,

130

the complexity of factors contributing to the losses, the legal and regulatory uncertainties, including the
interpretation of policy terms and conditions, and the nature of the information available to establish
the reserves. Complex factors include, but are not limited to: determining whether damage was caused
by flooding versus wind; evaluating general liability and pollution exposures; estimating additional living
expenses; estimating the impact of demand surge, infrastructure disruption, fraud, the effect of mold
damage and business interruption costs; and reinsurance collectibility. The timing of a catastrophe, such
as at or near the end of a reporting period, can also affect the information available to the Company in
estimating reserves for that reporting period. The estimates related to catastrophes are adjusted as
actual claims emerge.

A portion of the Company’s gross claims and claim adjustment expense reserves (totaling

$1.91 billion at December 31, 2017) are for asbestos and environmental claims and related litigation.
While the ongoing review of asbestos and environmental claims and associated liabilities considers the
inconsistencies of court decisions as to coverage, plaintiffs’ expanded theories of liability and the risks
inherent in complex litigation and other uncertainties, in the opinion of the Company’s management, it
is possible that the outcome of the continued uncertainties regarding these claims could result in
liability in future periods that differs from current insurance reserves by an amount that could be
material to the Company’s future operating results. See the preceding discussion of ‘‘Asbestos Claims
and Litigation’’ and ‘‘Environmental Claims and Litigation.’’

General Discussion

The process for estimating the liabilities for claims and claim adjustment expenses begins with the

collection and analysis of claim data. Data on individual reported claims, both current and historical,
including paid amounts and individual claim adjuster estimates, are grouped by common characteristics
(components) and evaluated by actuaries in their analyses of ultimate claim liabilities. Such data is
occasionally supplemented with external data as available and when appropriate. The process of
analyzing reserves for a component is undertaken on a regular basis, generally quarterly, in light of
continually updated information.

Multiple estimation methods are available for the analysis of ultimate claim liabilities. Each

estimation method has its own set of assumption variables and its own advantages and disadvantages,
with no single estimation method being better than the others in all situations and no one set of
assumption variables being meaningful for all product line components. The relative strengths and
weaknesses of the particular estimation methods when applied to a particular group of claims can also
change over time. Therefore, the actual choice of estimation method(s) can change with each
evaluation. The estimation method(s) chosen are those that are believed to produce the most reliable
indication at that particular evaluation date for the claim liabilities being evaluated.

In most cases, multiple estimation methods will be valid for the particular facts and circumstances

of the claim liabilities being evaluated. This will result in a range of reasonable estimates for any
particular claim liability. The Company uses such range analyses to back test whether previously
established estimates for reserves by reporting segments are reasonable, given available information.
Reported values found to be closer to the endpoints of a range of reasonable estimates are subject to
further detailed reviews. These reviews may substantiate the validity of management’s recorded
estimate or lead to a change in the reported estimate.

The exact boundary points of these ranges are more qualitative than quantitative in nature, as no
clear line of demarcation exists to determine when the set of underlying assumptions for an estimation
method switches from being reasonable to unreasonable. As a result, the Company does not believe
that the endpoints of these ranges are or would be comparable across companies. In addition, potential
interactions among the different estimation assumptions for different product lines make the
aggregation of individual ranges a highly judgmental and inexact process.

131

Property-casualty insurance policies are either written on a ‘‘claims-made’’ or on an ‘‘occurrence’’

basis. Claims-made policies generally cover, subject to requirements in individual policies, claims
reported during the policy period. Policies that are written on an occurrence basis require that the
insured demonstrate that a loss occurred in the policy period, even if the insured reports the loss many
years later.

Most general liability policies are written on an occurrence basis. These policies are subject to
substantial loss development over time as facts and circumstances change in the years following the
policy issuance. The occurrence form, which accounts for much of the reserve development in asbestos
and environmental exposures, is also used to provide coverage for construction general liability,
including construction defect. Occurrence-based forms of insurance for general liability exposures
require substantial projection of loss trends, which can be influenced by a number of factors, including
future inflation, judicial interpretations and societal litigation trends (e.g., size of jury awards and
propensity of individuals to pursue litigation), among others.

A basic premise in most actuarial analyses is that past patterns demonstrated in the data will

repeat themselves in the future, absent a material change in the associated risk factors discussed below.
To the extent a material change affecting the ultimate claim liability is known, such change is estimated
to the extent possible through an analysis of internal company data and, if available and when
appropriate, external data. Such a measurement is specific to the facts and circumstances of the
particular claim portfolio and the known change being evaluated. Significant structural changes to the
available data, product mix or organization can materially impact the reserve estimation process. In
addition, the introduction of new products creates a unique risk as historical company data would
typically not be available.

Informed judgment is applied throughout the reserving process. This includes the application of

various individual experiences and expertise to multiple sets of data and analyses. In addition to
actuaries, experts involved with the reserving process also include underwriting and claims personnel
and lawyers, as well as other company management. Therefore, management may have to consider
varying individual viewpoints as part of its estimation of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
It is also likely that during periods of significant change, such as a merger, consistent application of
informed judgment becomes even more complicated and difficult.

The variables discussed above in this general discussion have different impacts on reserve

estimation uncertainty for a given product line, depending on the length of the claim tail, the reporting
lag, the impact of individual claims and the complexity of the claim process for a given product line.

Product lines are generally classifiable as either long tail or short tail, based on the average length

of time between the event triggering claims under a policy and the final resolution of those claims.
Short tail claims are reported and settled quickly, resulting in less estimation variability. The longer the
time to final claim resolution, the greater the exposure to estimation risks and hence the greater the
estimation uncertainty.

A major component of the claim tail is the reporting lag. The reporting lag, which is the time

between the event triggering a claim and the reporting of the claim to the insurer, makes estimating
IBNR inherently more uncertain. In addition, the greater the reporting lag, the greater the proportion
of IBNR to the total claim liability for the product line. Writing new products with material reporting
lags can result in adding several years’ worth of IBNR claim exposure before the reporting lag exposure
becomes clearly observable, thereby increasing the risk associated with estimating the liabilities for
claims and claim adjustment expenses for such products. The most extreme example of claim liabilities
with long reporting lags are asbestos claims.

For some lines, the impact of large individual claims can be material to the analysis. These lines
are generally referred to as being ‘‘low frequency/high severity,’’ while lines without this ‘‘large claim’’

132

sensitivity are referred to as ‘‘high frequency/low severity.’’ Estimates of claim liabilities for low
frequency/high severity lines can be sensitive to the impact of a small number of potentially large
claims. As a result, the role of judgment is much greater for these reserve estimates. In contrast, for
high frequency/low severity lines the impact of individual claims is relatively minor and the range of
reasonable reserve estimates is likely narrower and more stable.

Claim complexity can also greatly affect the estimation process by impacting the number of

assumptions needed to produce the estimate, the potential stability of the underlying data and claim
process, and the ability to gain an understanding of the data. Product lines with greater claim
complexity, such as for certain surety and construction exposures, have inherently greater estimation
uncertainty.

Actuaries have to exercise a considerable degree of judgment in the evaluation of all these factors
in their analysis of reserves. The human element in the application of actuarial judgment is unavoidable
when faced with material uncertainty. Different actuaries may choose different assumptions when faced
with such uncertainty, based on their individual backgrounds, professional experiences and areas of
focus. Hence, the estimates selected by the various actuaries may differ materially from each other.
Lastly, significant structural changes to the available data, product mix or organization can also

materially impact the reserve estimation process. Events such as mergers increase the inherent
uncertainty of reserve estimates for a period of time, until stable trends re-establish themselves within
the new organization.

Risk Factors

The major causes of material uncertainty (‘‘risk factors’’) generally will vary for each product line,
as well as for each separately analyzed component of the product line. In a few cases, such risk factors
are explicit assumptions of the estimation method, but in most cases, they are implicit. For example, a
method may explicitly assume that a certain percentage of claims will close each year, but will implicitly
assume that the legal interpretation of existing contract language will remain unchanged. Actual results
will likely vary from expectations for each of these assumptions, causing actual paid losses, as claims
are settled in the future, to be different in amount than the reserves being estimated currently.

Some risk factors will affect more than one product line. Examples include changes in claim

department practices, changes in settlement patterns, regulatory and legislative actions, court actions,
timeliness of claim reporting, state mix of claimants and degree of claimant fraud. The extent of the
impact of a risk factor will also vary by components within a product line. Individual risk factors are
also subject to interactions with other risk factors within product line components.

The effect of a particular risk factor on estimates of claim liabilities cannot be isolated in most
cases. For example, estimates of potential claim settlements may be impacted by the risk associated
with potential court rulings, but the final settlement agreement typically does not delineate how much
of the settled amount is due to this and other factors.

The evaluation of data is also subject to distortion from extreme events or structural shifts,

sometimes in unanticipated ways. For example, the timing of claims payments in one geographic region
may be impacted if claim adjusters are temporarily reassigned from that region to help settle
catastrophe claims in another region.

While some changes in the claim environment are sudden in nature (such as a new court ruling

affecting the interpretation of all contracts in that jurisdiction), others are more evolutionary.
Evolutionary changes can occur when multiple factors affect final claim values, with the uncertainty
surrounding each factor being resolved separately, in stepwise fashion. The final impact is not known
until all steps have occurred.

133

Sudden changes generally cause a one-time shift in claim liability estimates, although there may be

some lag in reliable quantification of their impact. Evolutionary changes generally cause a series of
shifts in claim liability estimates, as each component of the evolutionary change becomes evident and
estimable.

Actuarial Methods for Analyzing and Estimating Claims and Claim Adjustment Expense Reserves

The principal estimation and analysis methods utilized by the Company’s actuaries to evaluate

management’s existing estimates for prior accident periods are the paid loss development method, the
case incurred development method, the Bornhuetter-Ferguson (BF) method, and average value analysis
combined with the reported claim development method. The BF method is usually utilized for more
recent accident periods, with a transition to other methods as the underlying claim data becomes more
voluminous and therefore more credible. These estimation and analysis methods are typically referred
to as conventional actuarial methods. (See note 7 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for
an explanation of these methods).

While the Company utilizes these conventional actuarial methods to estimate the claims liability

for its various businesses, Company actuaries evaluating a particular component for a product line may
select from the full range of methods developed within the casualty actuarial profession. The
Company’s actuaries are also continually monitoring developments within the profession for advances in
existing techniques or the creation of new techniques that might improve current and future estimates.
Some components of a product line may be susceptible to infrequent large claims or not be subject

to conventional methods. In such cases, the Company’s actuarial analysis will isolate such components
for review. The reserves excluding such large claims are generally analyzed using the conventional
methods described above. The reserves associated with large claims are then analyzed utilizing various
methods, such as:

(cid:127) Estimating the number of large claims and their average values based on historical trends from
prior accident periods, adjusted for the current environment and supplemented with actual data
for the accident year analyzed to the extent available.

(cid:127) Utilizing individual claim adjuster estimates of the large claims, combined with continual

monitoring of the aggregate accuracy of such claim adjuster estimates. (This monitoring may
lead to supplemental adjustments to the aggregate of such claim estimates).

(cid:127) Utilizing historic longer-term average ratios of large claims to small claims, and applying such

ratios to the estimated ultimate small claims from conventional analysis.

(cid:127) Ground-up analysis of the underlying exposure (typically used for asbestos and environmental).
The results of such methodologies are subjected to various reasonability and diagnostic tests,

including implied incurred-loss-to-earned-premium ratios, non-zero claim severity trends and
paid-to-incurred loss ratios. An actual versus expected analysis is also performed comparing actual loss
development to expected development embedded within management’s best estimate. Additional
analyses may be performed based on the results of these diagnostics, including the investigation of
other actuarial methods.

The methods described above are generally utilized to evaluate management’s estimate for prior

accident periods. For the initial estimate of the current accident year, however, the available claim data
is typically insufficient to produce a reliable indication. As a result, the initial estimate for an accident
year is generally based on an exposure-based method using either the loss ratio projection method or
the expected loss method. The loss ratio projection method, which is typically used for guaranteed-cost
business, develops an initial estimate for an accident year by multiplying earned premiums for the
accident year by a projected loss ratio. The projected loss ratio is determined by analyzing prior period

134

experience, and adjusting for loss cost trends, rate level differences, mix of business changes and other
known or observed factors influencing the current accident year relative to prior accident years. The
exact number of prior accident years utilized varies by product line component, based on the stability
and consistency of the individual accident year estimates. The expected loss method, which is typically
used for loss sensitive business, develops an initial estimate of ultimate claims and claim adjustment
expenses for an accident year by analyzing exposures by account.

Management’s Estimates

At least once per quarter, certain members of Company management meet with the Company’s
actuaries to review the latest claims and claim adjustment expense reserve analyses. Based on these
analyses, management determines whether its ultimate claim liability estimates should be changed. In
doing so, it must evaluate whether the new data provided represents credible actionable information or
an anomaly that will have no effect on estimated ultimate claim liability. For example, as described
above, payments may have decreased in one geographic region due to fewer claim adjusters being
available to process claims. The resulting claim payment patterns would be analyzed to determine
whether or not the change in payment pattern represents a change in ultimate claim liability.

Such an assessment requires considerable judgment. It is frequently not possible to determine

whether a change in the data is an anomaly until sometime after the event. Even if a change is
determined to be permanent, it is not always possible to reliably determine the extent of the change
until sometime later. The overall detailed analyses supporting such an effort can take several months to
perform as the underlying causes of the trends observed need to be evaluated, which may require the
gathering or assembling of data not previously available. It may also include interviews with experts
involved with the underlying processes. As a result, there can be a time lag between the emergence of a
change and a determination that the change should be reflected in the Company’s estimated claim
liabilities. The final estimate selected by management in a reporting period is based on these various
detailed analyses of past data, adjusted to reflect any new actionable information.

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors reviews the process by which the Company

establishes reserves for the purpose of the Company’s financial statements.

Discussion of Product Lines

The following section details reserving considerations and common risk factors by product line.

There are many additional risk factors that may impact ultimate claim costs. Each risk factor presented
will have a different impact on required reserves. Also, risk factors can have offsetting or compounding
effects on required reserves. For example, in workers’ compensation, the use of expensive medical
procedures that result in medical cost inflation may enable workers to return to work faster, thereby
lowering indemnity costs. Thus, in almost all cases, it is impossible to discretely measure the effect of a
single risk factor and construct a meaningful sensitivity expectation.

In order to provide information on reasonably possible reserving changes by product line, the

historical changes in year-end claims and claim adjustment expense reserves over a one-year period are
provided for the U.S. product lines. This information is provided for both the Company and the
industry for the nine most recent years, and is based on the most recent publicly available data for the
reported line(s) that most closely match the individual product line being discussed. These changes
were calculated, net of reinsurance, from statutory annual statement data found in Schedule P of those
statements, and represent the reported reserve development on the beginning-of-the-year claim
liabilities divided by the beginning claim liabilities, all accident years combined, excluding non-defense
related claim adjustment expense. Data presented for the Company includes history for the entire
Travelers group (U.S. companies only), as required by the statutory reporting instructions promulgated
by state regulatory authorities for Schedule P. Comparable data for non-U.S. companies is not available.

General Liability

General liability is generally considered a long tail line, as it takes a relatively long period of time

to finalize and settle claims from a given accident year. The speed of claim reporting and claim
settlement is a function of the characteristics of claims, including specific coverage provided, the
jurisdiction and specific policy provisions such as self-insured retentions, among others. There are
numerous components underlying the general liability product line. Some of these have relatively
moderate payment patterns (with most of the claims for a given accident year closed within five to
seven years), while others can have extreme lags in both reporting and payment of claims (e.g., a
reporting lag of a decade or more for ‘‘construction defect’’ claims).

While the majority of general liability coverages are written on an ‘‘occurrence’’ basis, certain
general liability coverages (such as those covering management and professional liability, including
cyber coverages) are typically insured on a ‘‘claims-made’’ basis.

General liability reserves are generally analyzed as two components: primary and excess/umbrella,

with the primary component generally analyzed separately for bodily injury and property damage.
Bodily injury liability payments reimburse the claimant for damages pertaining to physical injury as a
result of the policyholder’s legal obligation arising from non-intentional acts such as negligence, subject
to the insurance policy provisions. In some cases the damages can include future wage loss (which is a
function of future earnings power and wage inflation) and future medical treatment costs. Property
damage liability payments result from damages to the claimant’s private property arising from the
policyholder’s legal obligation for non-intentional acts. In most cases, property damage losses are a
function of costs as of the loss date, or soon thereafter.

In addition, sizable or unique exposures are reviewed separately. These exposures include asbestos,

environmental, other mass torts, construction defect and large unique accounts that would otherwise
distort the analysis. These unique categories often require a very high degree of judgment and require
reserve analyses that do not rely on conventional actuarial methods.

Defense costs are also a part of the insured costs covered by liability policies and can be

significant, sometimes greater than the cost of the actual paid claims. For some products this risk is
mitigated by policy language such that the insured portion of defense costs is included in the policy
limit available to pay the claim. Such ‘‘defense within the limits’’ policies are most common for
‘‘claims-made’’ products. When defense costs are outside of the policy limits, the full amount of the
policy limit is available to pay claims and the amounts paid for defense costs have no contractual limit.

This line is typically the largest source of reserve estimate uncertainty in the United States

(excluding assumed reinsurance contracts covering the same risk). Major contributors to this reserve
estimate uncertainty include the reporting lag (i.e., the length of time between the event triggering
coverage and the actual reporting of the claim), the number of parties involved in the underlying tort
action, whether the ‘‘event’’ triggering coverage is confined to only one time period or is spread over
multiple time periods, the potential dollars involved (in the individual claim actions), whether such
claims were reasonably foreseeable and intended to be covered at the time the contracts were written
(i.e., coverage dispute potential), and the potential for mass claim actions. Claims with longer reporting
lags result in greater estimation uncertainty. This is especially true for alleged claims with a latency
feature, particularly where courts have ruled that coverage is spread over multiple policy years, hence
involving multiple defendants (and their insurers and reinsurers) and multiple policies (thereby
increasing the potential dollars involved and the underlying settlement complexity). Claims with long
latencies also increase the potential recognition lag (i.e., the lag between writing a type of policy in a
certain market and the recognition that such policies have potential mass tort and/or latent claim
exposure).

136

The amount of reserve estimate uncertainty also varies significantly by component for the general

liability product line. The components in this product line with the longest latency, longest reporting
lags, largest potential dollars involved and greatest claim settlement complexity are asbestos and
environmental. Components that include latency, reporting lag and/or complexity issues, but to a
materially lesser extent than asbestos and environmental, include construction defect and other mass
tort actions. Many components of general liability are not subject to material latency or claim
complexity risks and hence have materially less uncertainty than the previously mentioned components.
In general, components with shorter reporting lags, fewer parties involved in settlement negotiations,
only one policy potentially triggered per claim, fewer potential settlement dollars, reasonably
foreseeable (and stable) potential hazards/claims and no mass tort potential result in much less reserve
estimate uncertainty than components without those characteristics.

In addition to the conventional actuarial methods mentioned in the general discussion section, the

company utilizes various report year development and S-curve methods for the construction defect
components of this product line. The Construction Defect report year development analysis is
supplemented with projected claim counts and average values for IBNR claim counts. For components
with greater lags in claim reporting, such as excess and umbrella components of this product line, the
company relies more heavily on the BF method than on the paid and case incurred development
methods.

Examples of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the

required general liability reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section) include:

(cid:127) Product mix (e.g., size of account, industries insured, jurisdiction mix)
Unanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves. As an indicator of the causal effect that a

change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for general liability (excluding asbestos and
environmental), a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future
calendar year could result in a 1.5% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense
reserves.

Historically, the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line, excluding estimated

asbestos and environmental amounts, over the last nine years has varied from  ǁ8% to  ǁ3%
(averaging  ǁ4%) for the Company, and from  ǁ5% to 0% (averaging  ǁ3%) for the industry overall.
The Company’s year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year.
The Company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible
one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line. General liability reserves (excluding
asbestos and environmental) represent approximately 20% of the Company’s total claims and claim
adjustment expense reserves.

The Company’s change in reserve estimate for this product line, excluding estimated asbestos and

environmental amounts, was  ǁ4% for 2017,  ǁ4% for 2016 and  ǁ3% for 2015. The 2017 change
primarily reflected better than expected loss experience for both primary and excess coverages for
accident years 2009 through 2016. The 2016 change primarily reflected better than expected loss
experience for both primary and excess coverages for accident years 2015 and prior. The 2015 change
primarily reflected better than expected loss experience for excess coverages for accident years 2005
through 2013.

Commercial Property

Commercial property is generally considered a short tail line with a simpler and faster claim

reporting and adjustment process than liability coverages, and less uncertainty in the reserve setting
process (except for more complex business interruption claims). It is generally viewed as a moderate
frequency, low to moderate severity line, except for catastrophes and coverage related to large
properties. The claim reporting and settlement process for property coverage claim reserves is generally
restricted to the insured and the insurer. Overall, the claim liabilities for this line create a low
estimation risk, except possibly for catastrophes and business interruption claims.

Commercial property reserves are typically analyzed in two components, one for catastrophic or

other large single events, and another for all other events. Examples of common risk factors, or
perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required property reserves (beyond those
included in the general discussion section) include:

Commercial property risk factors

(cid:127) Physical concentration of policyholders
(cid:127) Availability and cost of local contractors
(cid:127) For the more severe catastrophic events, ‘‘demand surge’’ inflation, which refers to significant

short-term increases in building material and labor costs due to a sharp increase in demand for
those materials and services

(cid:127) Local building codes
(cid:127) Amount of time to return property to full usage (for business interruption claims)
(cid:127) Frequency of claim re-openings on claims previously closed
(cid:127) Court interpretation of policy provisions (such as occurrence definition, or wind versus flooding)

138

(cid:127) Lags in reporting claims (e.g., winter damage to summer homes, hidden damage after an

(cid:127) Changes in underwriting standards
Unanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves. As an indicator of the causal effect that a

change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for property, a 1% increase (decrease) in
incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.1% increase
(decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.

Historically, the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the last nine

years has varied from  ǁ25% to  ǁ5% (averaging  ǁ15%) for the Company, and from  ǁ14% to  ǁ5%
(averaging  ǁ8%) for the industry overall. The Company’s year-to-year changes are driven by, and are
based on, observed events during the year. The Company believes that its range of historical outcomes
is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line.
Commercial property reserves represent approximately 3% of the Company’s total claims and claim
adjustment expense reserves.

Since commercial property is considered a short tail coverage, the one year change for commercial
property can be more volatile than that for the longer tail product lines. This is due to the fact that the
majority of the reserve for commercial property relates to the most recent accident year, which is
subject to the most uncertainty for all product lines. This recent accident year uncertainty is relevant to
commercial property because of weather-related events which, notwithstanding 2013 through 2016
experience, tend to be concentrated in the second half of the year, and generally are not completely
resolved until the following year. Reserve estimates associated with major catastrophes may take even
longer to resolve. The reserve estimates for this product line are also potentially subject to material
changes due to uncertainty in measuring ultimate losses for significant catastrophes such as the events
of September 11, 2001, Hurricane Katrina and Storm Sandy.

The Company’s change in reserve estimate for this product line was  ǁ9% for 2017,  ǁ9% for 2016

and  ǁ21% for 2015. The 2017 change primarily reflected better than expected loss experience related
to non-catastrophe losses for accident years 2015 and 2016. The 2016 change primarily reflected better
than expected loss experience related to non-catastrophe losses for accident years 2014 and 2015. The
2015 change primarily reflected better than expected loss experience related to catastrophe losses for
accident years 2011, 2012 and 2014, and non-catastrophe losses for accident years 2013 and 2014.

Commercial Multi-Peril

Commercial multi-peril provides a combination of property and liability coverage typically for small

businesses and, therefore, includes both short and long tail coverages. For property coverage, it
generally takes a relatively short period of time to close claims, while for the other coverages, generally
for the liability coverages, it takes a longer period of time to close claims.

The reserving risk for this line is dominated by the liability coverage portion of this product, except
occasionally in the event of catastrophic or other large single loss events. The reserving risk for this line
differs from that of the general liability product line and the property product line due to the nature of
the customer. Commercial multi-peril is generally sold to small- to mid-sized accounts, while the
customer profile for general liability and commercial property includes larger customers.

139

See ‘‘Commercial property risk factors’’ and ‘‘General liability risk factors,’’ discussed above, with

regard to reserving risk for commercial multi-peril.

Unanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves. As an indicator of the causal effect that a

change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for commercial multi-peril (excluding
asbestos and environmental), a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each
future calendar year could result in a 1.2% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense
reserves.

Historically, the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line, excluding estimated
asbestos and environmental amounts, over the last nine years has varied from  ǁ9% to 5% (averaging
0%) for the Company, and from  ǁ6% to 1% (averaging  ǁ2%) for the industry overall. The
Company’s year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year. The
Company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year
changes in reserve estimates for this product line. Commercial multi-peril reserves (excluding asbestos
and environmental reserves) represent approximately 8% of the Company’s total claims and claim
adjustment expense reserves.

As discussed above, this line combines general liability and commercial property coverages and it

has been impacted in the past by many of the same events as those two lines.

The Company’s change in reserve estimate for this product line was  ǁ5% for 2017, 1% for 2016

and  ǁ1% for 2015. The 2017 change primarily reflected better than expected loss experience for
liability coverages for accident years 2016 and prior. The 2016 change primarily reflected worse than
expected loss experience for property coverages related to non-catastrophe losses for accident year
2015. The 2015 change primarily reflected better than expected loss experience for property coverages
related to non-catastrophe losses for accident years 2012 and 2014.

Commercial Automobile

The commercial automobile product line is a mix of property and liability coverages and, therefore,

includes both short and long tail coverages. The payments that are made quickly typically pertain to
auto physical damage (property) claims and property damage (liability) claims. The payments that take
longer to finalize and are more difficult to estimate relate to bodily injury claims. In general, claim
reporting lags are generally short, claim complexity is not a major issue, and the line is viewed as high
frequency, low to moderate severity. Overall, the claim liabilities for this line create a moderate
estimation risk.

Commercial automobile reserves are typically analyzed in four components: bodily injury liability;
property damage liability; collision claims; and comprehensive claims. These last two components have
minimum reserve risk and fast payouts and, accordingly, separate risk factors are not presented.

The Company utilizes the conventional actuarial methods mentioned in the general discussion

above in estimating claim liabilities for this line. This is supplemented with detailed custom analyses
where needed.

Examples of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the

required commercial automobile reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section)
include:

Unanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves. As an indicator of the causal effect that a

change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for commercial automobile, a 1% increase

Historically, the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the last nine

years has varied from  ǁ6% to 7% (averaging 1%) for the Company, and from  ǁ3% to 7% (averaging
1%) for the industry overall. The Company’s year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on,
observed events during the year. The Company believes that its range of historical outcomes is
illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line.
Commercial automobile reserves represent approximately 7% of the Company’s total claims and claim
adjustment expense reserves.

The Company’s change in reserve estimate for this product line was 4% for 2017,  ǁ1% for 2016
and 0% for 2015. The 2017 change primarily reflected worse than expected loss experience for liability
coverages for accident years 2013 through 2016. The 2016 change primarily reflected better than
expected loss experience for accident years 2011 and prior.

Workers’ Compensation

Workers’ compensation is generally considered a long tail coverage, as it takes a relatively long
period of time to finalize claims from a given accident year. While certain payments such as initial
medical treatment or temporary wage replacement for the injured worker are made quickly, some other
payments are made over the course of several years, such as awards for permanent partial injuries. In
addition, some payments can run as long as the injured worker’s life, such as permanent disability

141

benefits and on-going medical care. Despite the possibility of long payment tails, the reporting lags are
generally short, payment obligations are generally not complex, and most of the liability can be
considered high frequency with moderate severity. The largest reserve risk generally comes from the
low frequency, high severity claims providing lifetime coverage for medical expense arising from a
worker’s injury, as such claims are subject to greater inflation risk. Overall, the claim liabilities for this
line create a somewhat greater than moderate estimation risk.

Workers’ compensation reserves are typically analyzed in three components: indemnity losses,

medical losses and claim adjustment expenses.

Examples of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the

required workers’ compensation reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section)
include:

Indemnity risk factors

(cid:127) Time required to recover from the injury
(cid:127) Degree of available transitional jobs
(cid:127) Degree of legal involvement
(cid:127) Changes in the interpretations and processes of the administrative bodies that oversee workers’

change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for workers’ compensation, a 1% increase
(decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.3%
increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.

Historically, the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the last nine

years has varied from  ǁ3% to 0% (averaging  ǁ1%) for the Company, and from  ǁ2% to 1%

based on, observed events during the year. The Company believes that its range of historical outcomes
is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line.
Workers’ compensation reserves represent approximately 39% of the Company’s total claims and claim
adjustment expense reserves.

The Company’s change in reserve estimate for this product line was  ǁ3% for 2017,  ǁ2% for 2016

and  ǁ1% for 2015. The 2017 change primarily reflected better than expected loss experience for
accident years 2016 and prior. The 2016 change primarily reflected better than expected loss experience
for accident years 2006 and prior as well as accident years 2009, 2013 and 2015. The 2015 change
primarily reflected better than expected loss experience for accident years 2006 and prior.

Fidelity and Surety

Fidelity is generally considered a short tail coverage. It takes a relatively short period of time to

finalize and settle most fidelity claims. The volatility of fidelity reserves is generally related to the type
of business of the insured, the size and complexity of the insured’s business operations, amount of
policy limit and attachment point of coverage. The uncertainty surrounding reserves for small,
commercial insureds is typically less than the uncertainty for large commercial or financial institutions.
The high frequency, low severity nature of small commercial fidelity losses provides for stability in loss
estimates, whereas the low frequency, high severity nature of losses for large insureds results in a wider
range of ultimate loss outcomes. Actuarial techniques that rely on a stable pattern of loss development
are generally not applicable to low frequency, high severity claims.

Surety has certain components that are generally considered short tail coverages with short

reporting lags, although large individual construction and commercial surety contracts can result in a
long settlement tail, based on the length and complexity of the construction project(s) or commercial
transaction being insured. The frequency of losses in surety generally correlates with economic cycles as
the primary cause of surety loss is the inability of an insured to fulfill its contractual obligations. The
Company actively seeks to mitigate this exposure to loss through disciplined risk selection, adherence to
underwriting standards and ongoing monitoring of contractor progress in significant construction
projects. The volatility of surety losses is generally related to the type of business performed by the
insured, the type of bonded obligation, the amount of limit exposed to loss and the amount of assets
available to the insurer to mitigate losses, such as unbilled contract funds, collateral, first and third
party indemnity, and other security positions of an insured’s assets. Certain classes of surety claims are
very high severity, low frequency in nature. These can include large construction contractors involved
with one or multiple large, complex projects as well as certain large commercial surety exposures.
Other claim factors affecting reserve variability of surety include litigation related to amounts owed by
and due the insured (e.g., salvage and subrogation efforts) and the results of financial restructuring of
an insured.

Unanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves. As an indicator of the causal effect that a

change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for fidelity and surety, a 1% increase
(decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.3%

Historically, the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the last nine

years has varied from  ǁ36% to  ǁ6% (averaging  ǁ18%) for the Company, and from  ǁ17% to  ǁ2%
(averaging  ǁ10%) for the industry overall. The Company’s year-to-year changes are driven by, and are
based on, observed events during the year. The Company believes that its range of historical outcomes
is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line. Fidelity
and surety reserves represent approximately 1% of the Company’s total claims and claim adjustment
expense reserves.

In general, developments on single large claims (both adverse and favorable) are a primary source

of changes in reserve estimates for this product line.

The Company’s change in reserve estimate for this product line was  ǁ10% for 2017,  ǁ36% for

2016 and  ǁ30% for 2015. The 2017 change primarily reflected better than expected loss experience in

144

the fidelity and surety product line for accident years 2014 and 2015. The 2016 change primarily
reflected better than expected loss experience in the fidelity and surety product line for accident years
2009 through 2015. The 2015 change primarily reflected better than expected loss experience in the
fidelity and surety product line for accident years 2008 through 2014, which was partially driven by a
reduction in outstanding exposures related to the financial crisis that commenced in 2007.

Personal Automobile

Personal automobile includes both short and long tail coverages. The payments that are made
quickly typically pertain to auto physical damage (property) claims and property damage (liability)
claims. The payments that take longer to finalize and are more difficult to estimate relate to bodily
injury claims. Reporting lags are relatively short and the claim settlement process for personal
automobile liability generally is the least complex of the liability products. It is generally viewed as a
high frequency, low to moderate severity product line. Overall, the claim liabilities for this line create a
moderate estimation risk.

Personal automobile reserves are typically analyzed in five components: bodily injury liability,

property damage liability, no-fault losses, collision claims and comprehensive claims. These last two
components have minimum reserve risk and fast payouts and, accordingly, separate factors are not
presented.

Examples of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the

required personal automobile reserves (beyond those included in the general reserve discussion section)
include:

Unanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves. As an indicator of the causal effect that a

change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for personal automobile, a 1% increase
(decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.1%
increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.

Historically, the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the last nine

years has varied from  ǁ4% to 3% (averaging 1%) for the Company, and from  ǁ3% to 2%
(averaging  ǁ1%) for the industry overall. The Company’s year-to-year changes are driven by, and are
based on, observed events during the year. The Company believes that its range of historical outcomes
is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line.
Personal automobile reserves represent approximately 7% of the Company’s total claims and claim
adjustment expense reserves.

The Company’s change in reserve estimate for this product line was 0% for 2017, 3% for 2016

and  ǁ4% for 2015. The 2016 change primarily reflected worse than expected loss experience for
liability coverages for accident year 2015. The change for 2015 primarily reflected better than expected
loss experience for liability coverages for accident years 2012 through 2014.

Homeowners and Personal Lines Other

Homeowners is generally considered a short tail coverage. Most payments are related to the

property portion of the policy, where the claim reporting and settlement process is generally restricted
to the insured and the insurer. Claims on property coverage are typically reported soon after the actual
damage occurs, although delays of several months are not unusual. The resulting settlement process is
typically fairly short term, although exceptions do exist.

The liability portion of the homeowners policy generates claims which take longer to pay due to
the involvement of litigation and negotiation, but with generally small reporting lags. Personal Lines
Other products include personal umbrella policies, among others. See ‘‘general liability reserving risk
factors,’’ discussed above, for reserving risk factors related to umbrella coverages.

Overall, the line is generally high frequency, low to moderate severity (except for catastrophes),

with simple to moderate claim complexity.

Homeowners reserves are typically analyzed in two components: non-catastrophe related losses and

catastrophe loss payments.

Examples of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the

required homeowners reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section) include:

Non-catastrophe risk factors
(cid:127) Salvage opportunities
(cid:127) Amount of time to return property to residential use
(cid:127) Changes in weather patterns

Unanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves. As an indicator of the causal effect that a

change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for homeowners and personal lines other,
a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could
result in a 1.1% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.

Historically, the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line (excluding the

umbrella line of business, which for statutory reporting purposes is included with the general liability
line of business) over the last nine years has varied from  ǁ17% to 3% (averaging  ǁ8%) for the
Company, and from  ǁ7% to  ǁ1% (averaging  ǁ4%) for the industry overall. The Company’s
year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year. The Company
believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in
reserve estimates for this product line. Homeowners and personal lines other reserves represent
approximately 3% of the Company’s total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.

This line combines both liability and property coverages; however, the majority of the reserves

relate to property. While property is considered a short tail coverage, the one year change for property
can be more volatile than that for the longer tail product lines. This is due to the fact that the majority
of the reserve for property relates to the most recent accident year, which is subject to the most
uncertainty for all product lines. This recent accident year uncertainty is relevant to property because of
weather related events which tend to be concentrated in the second half of the year, and generally are
not completely resolved until the following year. Reserve estimates associated with major catastrophes,
including California wildfires in 2017, may take even longer to resolve.

147

The Company’s change in reserve estimate for this product line (excluding the umbrella line of
business) was 1% for 2017, 3% for 2016 and  ǁ16% for 2015. The 2017 change primarily reflected
modestly worse than expected loss experience for liability coverages for accident years 2014 and 2015.
The 2016 change primarily reflected modestly worse than expected loss experience for liability
coverages for accident years 2012 through 2014. The 2015 change primarily reflected better than
expected loss experience for liability coverages for accident years 2011 through 2014, and for
non-catastrophe weather-related losses and non-weather-related losses for accident year 2014.

International and Other

International and other includes products written by the Company’s international operations, as

well as all other products not explicitly discussed above. The principal component of ‘‘other’’ claim
reserves is assumed reinsurance written on an excess-of-loss basis, which may include reinsurance of
non-U.S. exposures, and is runoff business.

International and other claim liabilities result from a mix of coverages, currencies and

jurisdictions/countries. The common characteristic is the need to customize the analysis to the
individual component, and the inability to rely on data characterizations and reporting requirements in
the U.S. statutory reporting framework.

Due to changes in the business mix for this line over time, including the 2013 acquisition of

Dominion, the recently incurred claim liabilities are relatively shorter tail (due to both the products and
the jurisdictions involved, e.g., Canada, the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom), while the
older liabilities include some from runoff operations that are extremely long tail (e.g., U.S. excess
liabilities reinsured through the London market, and several underwriting pools in runoff). The speed
of claim reporting and claim settlement is a function of the specific coverage provided, the jurisdiction,
the distribution system (e.g., underwriting pool versus direct) and the proximity of the insurance sale to
the insured hazard (e.g., insured and insurer located in different countries). In particular, liabilities
arising from the underwriting pools in runoff may result in significant reporting lags, settlement lags
and claim complexity, due to the need to coordinate with other pool members or co-insurers through a
broker or lead-insurer for claim settlement purposes.

International reserves are generally analyzed by country and general coverage category

(e.g., General Liability in Canada, Commercial Property in the United Kingdom, etc.). The business is
also generally split by direct versus assumed reinsurance for a given coverage. Where the underlying
insured hazard is outside the United States, the underlying coverages are generally similar to those
described under the Homeowners, Personal Automobile, Commercial Automobile, General Liability,
Commercial Property and Surety discussions above, taking into account differences in the legal
environment and differences in terms and conditions. However, statutory coverage differences exist
amongst various jurisdictions. For example, in some jurisdictions there are no aggregate policy limits on
certain liability coverages.

Other reserves, primarily assumed reinsurance in runoff, are generally analyzed by program/pool,
treaty type, and general coverage category (e.g., General Liability—excess of loss reinsurance). Excess
exposure requires the insured to ‘‘prove’’ not only claims under the policy, but also the prior payment
of claims reaching up to the excess policy’s attachment point.

Examples of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the

required International and other reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section, and
in the Personal Automobile, Homeowners, General Liability, Commercial Property, Commercial
Automobile and Surety discussions above) include:

International and other risk factors

(cid:127) Changes in claim handling procedures, including those of the primary carriers

(cid:127) Changes in statutes of limitations

(cid:127) Changes in foreign currency exchange rates

International and other book of business risk factors

(cid:127) Changes in policy provisions (e.g., deductibles, policy limits, endorsements, ‘‘claims-made’’

language)

(cid:127) Changes in underwriting standards
(cid:127) Product mix (e.g., size of account, industries insured, jurisdiction mix)
Unanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves. As an indicator of the causal effect that a

change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for International and other (excluding
asbestos and environmental), a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each
future calendar year could result in a 1.2% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense
reserves. International and other reserves (excluding asbestos and environmental) represent
approximately 8% of the Company’s total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.

International and other represents a combination of different product lines, some of which are in

runoff. Comparative historical information is not available for international product lines as insurers
domiciled outside of the United States do not file U.S. statutory reports. Comparative historical
information on runoff business is not indicative of reasonably possible one-year changes in the reserve
estimate for this mix of runoff business. Accordingly, the Company has not included comparative
analyses for International and other.

Reinsurance Recoverables

Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the associated
claim liability. The Company evaluates and monitors the financial condition of its reinsurers under
voluntary reinsurance arrangements to minimize its exposure to significant losses from reinsurer
insolvencies. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, the Company becomes involved in
coverage disputes with its reinsurers. Some of these disputes could result in lawsuits and arbitrations
brought by or against the reinsurers to determine the Company’s rights and obligations under the
various reinsurance agreements. The Company employs dedicated specialists and comprehensive
strategies to manage reinsurance collections and disputes.

The Company has entered into a reinsurance contract in connection with a catastrophe bond

issued by Long Point Re III. This contract meets the requirements to be accounted for as reinsurance
in accordance with guidance for accounting for reinsurance contracts. The catastrophe bond is
described in more detail in ‘‘Item 1—Business—Catastrophe Reinsurance.’’

149

The Company reports its reinsurance recoverables net of an allowance for estimated uncollectible

reinsurance recoverables. The allowance is based upon the Company’s ongoing review of amounts
outstanding, length of collection periods, changes in reinsurer credit standing, disputes, applicable
coverage defenses and other relevant factors. Accordingly, the establishment of reinsurance
recoverables and the related allowance for uncollectible reinsurance recoverables is also an inherently
uncertain process involving estimates. From time to time, as a result of the long-tailed nature of the
underlying liabilities, coverage complexities and potential for disputes, the Company considers the
commutation of reinsurance contracts. Changes in estimated reinsurance recoverables and commutation
activity could result in additional income statement charges.

Recoverables attributable to structured settlements relate primarily to personal injury claims, of

which workers’ compensation claims comprise a significant portion, for which the Company has
purchased annuities and remains contingently liable in the event of a default by the companies issuing
the annuities. Recoverables attributable to mandatory pools and associations relate primarily to
workers’ compensation service business. These recoverables are supported by the participating
insurance companies’ obligation to pay a pro rata share based on each company’s voluntary market
share of written premium in each state in which it is a pool participant. In the event a member of a
mandatory pool or association defaults on its share of the pool’s or association’s obligations, the other
members’ share of such obligation increases proportionally.

Investment Valuation and Impairments

Valuation of Investments Reported at Fair Value in Financial Statements

The Company’s estimates of fair value for financial assets and financial liabilities are based on the

framework established in the fair value accounting guidance. The framework is based on the inputs
used in valuation, gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and requires that
observable inputs be used in the valuations when available.

The fair value of a financial instrument is the estimated amount at which the instrument could be

exchanged in an orderly transaction between knowledgeable, unrelated, willing parties, i.e., not in a
forced transaction. The estimated fair value of a financial instrument may differ from the amount that
could be realized if the security was sold in an immediate sale, e.g., a forced transaction. Additionally,
the valuation of investments is more subjective when markets are less liquid due to the lack of market
based inputs, which may increase the potential that the estimated fair value of an investment is not
reflective of the price at which an actual transaction would occur.

See note 4 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the

determination of fair value of investments.

Investment Impairments

See note 1 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of investment

impairments.

Due to the subjective nature of the Company’s analysis and estimates of future cash flows, along
with the judgment that must be applied in the analysis, it is possible that the Company could reach a
different conclusion whether or not to impair a security if it had access to additional information about
the issuer. Additionally, it is possible that the issuer’s actual ability to meet contractual obligations may
be different than what the Company determined during its analysis, which may lead to a different
impairment conclusion in future periods.

Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

MARKET RISK

Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as

interest rates (inclusive of credit spreads), foreign currency exchange rates and other relevant market
rate or price changes. Market risk is directly influenced by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in
which the related underlying assets are traded. The following is a discussion of the Company’s primary
market risk exposures and how those exposures are managed as of December 31, 2017. The Company’s
market risk sensitive instruments, including derivatives, are primarily entered into for purposes other
than trading.

The carrying value of the Company’s investment portfolio at December 31, 2017 and 2016 was

$72.50 billion and $70.49 billion, respectively, of which 86% was invested in fixed maturity securities at
both dates. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, approximately 7.3% and 7.1%, respectively, of the
Company’s invested assets were denominated in foreign currencies. The Company’s exposure to equity
price risk is not significant. The Company has no direct commodity risk and is not a party to any credit
default swaps.

The primary market risks to the investment portfolio are interest rate risk and credit risk

associated with investments in fixed maturity securities. The portfolio duration is primarily managed
through cash market transactions and treasury futures transactions. For additional information
regarding the Company’s investments, see notes 3 and 4 of notes to the consolidated financial
statements as well as the ‘‘Investment Portfolio’’ and ‘‘Outlook’’ sections of ‘‘Item 7—Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.’’

The primary market risk for all of the Company’s debt is interest rate risk at the time of
refinancing. The Company monitors the interest rate environment and evaluates refinancing
opportunities as maturity dates approach. For additional information regarding the Company’s debt, see
note 8 of notes to the consolidated financial statements as well as the ‘‘Liquidity and Capital
Resources’’ section of ‘‘Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations.’’

The Company’s foreign exchange market risk exposure is concentrated in the Company’s invested
assets, insurance reserves and shareholders’ equity denominated in foreign currencies. Cash flows from
the Company’s foreign operations are the primary source of funds for the purchase of investments
denominated in foreign currencies. The Company purchases these investments primarily to fund
insurance reserves and other liabilities denominated in the same currency, effectively reducing its
foreign currency exchange rate exposure. Invested assets denominated in the Canadian dollar
comprised approximately 4.4% of the total invested assets at both December 31, 2017 and 2016.
Invested assets denominated in the British Pound Sterling comprised approximately 2.0% and 1.9% of
total invested assets at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Invested assets denominated in other
currencies at December 31, 2017 and 2016 were not material.

There were no other significant changes in the Company’s primary market risk exposures or in

how those exposures were managed for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended
December 31, 2016. The Company does not currently anticipate significant changes in its primary
market risk exposures or in how those exposures are managed in future reporting periods based upon
what is known or expected to be in effect in future reporting periods.

152

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

Sensitivity analysis is defined as the measurement of potential loss in future earnings, fair values or
cash flows of market sensitive instruments resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in
interest rates and other market rates or prices over a selected period of time. In the Company’s
sensitivity analysis model, a hypothetical change in market rates is selected that is expected to reflect
reasonably possible near-term changes in those rates. ‘‘Near-term’’ means a period of time going
forward up to one year from the date of the consolidated financial statements. Actual results may differ
from the hypothetical change in market rates assumed in this disclosure, especially since this sensitivity
analysis does not reflect the results of any actions that would be taken by the Company to mitigate
such hypothetical losses in fair value.

Interest Rate Risk

In this sensitivity analysis model, the Company uses fair values to measure its potential loss. The
sensitivity analysis model includes the following financial instruments entered into for purposes other
than trading: fixed maturities, non-redeemable preferred stocks, mortgage loans, short-term securities,
debt and derivative financial instruments. The primary market risk to the Company’s market sensitive
instruments is interest rate risk (inclusive of credit spreads). The sensitivity analysis model uses various
basis point changes in interest rates to measure the hypothetical change in fair value of financial
instruments included in the model.

For invested assets with primary exposure to interest rate risk, estimates of portfolio duration and

convexity are used to model the loss of fair value that would be expected to result from a parallel
increase in interest rates. Durations on invested assets are adjusted for call, put and interest rate reset
features. Durations on tax-exempt securities are adjusted for the fact that the yields on such securities
do not normally move in lockstep with changes in the U.S. Treasury curve. Fixed maturity portfolio
durations are calculated on a market value weighted basis, including accrued interest, using holdings as
of December 31, 2017 and 2016.

For debt, the change in fair value is determined by calculating hypothetical December 31, 2017 and

2016 ending prices based on yields adjusted to reflect a 100 basis point change, comparing such
hypothetical ending prices to actual ending prices, and multiplying the difference by the par or
securities outstanding.

The sensitivity analysis model used by the Company produces a loss in fair value of market
sensitive instruments of approximately $2.08 billion and $2.19 billion based on a 100 basis point
increase in interest rates at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

The loss estimates do not take into account the impact of possible interventions that the Company

might reasonably undertake in order to mitigate or avoid losses that would result from emerging
interest rate trends. In addition, the loss value only reflects the impact of an interest rate increase on
the fair value of the Company’s financial instruments.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

The Company uses fair values of investment securities to measure its potential loss from foreign

denominated investments. A hypothetical 10% reduction in value of foreign denominated investments is
used to estimate the impact on the market value of the foreign denominated holdings. The Company’s
analysis indicates that a hypothetical 10% reduction in the value of foreign denominated investments
would be expected to produce a loss in fair value of approximately $528 million and $502 million at
December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Shareholders and Board of Directors
The Travelers Companies, Inc.:

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Travelers Companies, Inc.

and subsidiaries (the ‘‘Company’’) as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the related consolidated
statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each
of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2017, and the related notes and financial
statement schedules as listed in the accompanying index to consolidated financial statements and
schedules (collectively, the ‘‘consolidated financial statements’’). In our opinion, the consolidated
financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of
December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years
in the three-year period ended December 31, 2017, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting

Oversight Board (United States) (‘‘PCAOB’’), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report
dated February 15, 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our

responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with
respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require

that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated
financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits
included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated
financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those
risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of The Travelers Companies, Inc.

(together with its subsidiaries, the Company). The preparation of the consolidated financial statements
in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and claims and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. Certain reclassifications have been made to the 2016 and 2015 financial
statements to conform to the 2017 presentation, including reclassifications related to the realignment of
the Company’s reportable business segments as described in the ‘‘Nature of Operations’’ section of this
note. All material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.

On August 4, 2017, the Company completed its previously announced acquisition of all issued and

outstanding shares of Simply Business Holdings Ltd (Simply Business), a leading provider of small
business insurance policies in the United Kingdom, for a purchase price of approximately $464 million,
which included the repayment of debt and other obligations of Simply Business. In addition, the
Company issued 95,953 shares of restricted common stock valued at approximately $12 million to
certain employees of Simply Business who were equity holders of Simply Business. Subject to the
satisfaction of certain conditions, 50% of the restricted stock will vest two years from the issuance date
and the remainder will vest three years from the issuance date. The Company used a portion of the net
proceeds from the issuance of senior notes in May 2017 (described in more detail in note 8) and
internal resources to fund this transaction.

Adoption of Accounting Standards
Investments—Equity Method and Joint Ventures: Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of

Accounting

In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued updated guidance that

eliminates the requirement to retroactively apply the equity method of accounting when an investment
that was previously accounted for using another method of accounting becomes qualified to apply the
equity method due to an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence. If the
investment was previously accounted for as an available-for-sale security, any related unrealized gain or
loss in accumulated other comprehensive income at the date the investment becomes qualified for the
equity method is recognized through earnings. The updated guidance was effective for reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and was applied prospectively. The adoption of this
guidance did not have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or
liquidity.

Derivatives and Hedging: Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments

In March 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance clarifying that when a call (put) option in a
debt instrument can accelerate the repayment of principal on the debt instrument, a reporting entity
does not need to assess whether the contingent event that triggers the ability to exercise the call (put)
option is related to interest rates or credit risk in determining whether the option should be accounted
for separately. The updated guidance was effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15,

161

THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
2016. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company’s results of
operations, financial position or liquidity.

Compensation—Retirement Benefits: Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net

Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost

In March 2017, the FASB issued updated guidance to improve the presentation of net periodic

pension cost and net periodic postretirement cost (net benefit costs). Net benefit costs comprise several
components that reflect different aspects of an employer’s financial arrangements as well as the cost of
benefits provided to employees. The updated guidance requires that the employer service cost
component be reported in the same lines as other employee compensation cost and that the other
components (non-service costs) be presented separately from the service cost and outside of a subtotal
of income from operations if one is presented. The updated guidance also allows only the service cost
component to be eligible for capitalization in assets when applicable.

The updated guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and is

to be applied retrospectively with respect to the presentation of service and non-service costs, and
prospectively with respect to service costs only being eligible for capitalization. Early adoption is
permitted as of the first interim period of an annual period if an entity issues interim financial
statements.

The Company adopted the updated guidance effective January 1, 2017. See note 14 which has

been expanded to disclose the amount of service cost and non-service cost components of net periodic
benefit cost and the line items in the consolidated statements of income in which such amounts are
reported. The updated guidance with respect to only service costs being eligible for capitalization in
assets was not applicable, as the Company capitalizes only commission and premium-related taxes in
deferred acquisition costs.

Compensation—Stock Compensation: Scope of Modification Accounting

In May 2017, the FASB issued updated guidance related to a change to the terms or conditions
(modification) of a share-based payment award. The updated guidance provides that an entity should
account for the effects of a modification unless the fair value and vesting conditions of the modified
award and the classification of the modified award (equity or liability instrument) are the same as the
original award immediately before the modification.

The updated guidance is effective for the quarter ending March 31, 2018. The update is to be

applied prospectively to an award modified on or after the adoption date. Early adoption is permitted
in any interim periods for which financial statements have not yet been made available for issuance.

The Company adopted the updated guidance effective April 1, 2017. The adoption did not have an

effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or liquidity.

Other Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted
Revenue from Contracts with Customers

In May 2014, the FASB issued updated guidance to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue.

While insurance contracts are not within the scope of this updated guidance, the Company’s fee income
related to providing claims and policy management services as well as claim and loss prevention

162

THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
services will, to the extent such services are not related to the insurance contracts issued by the
Company, be subject to this updated guidance.

The updated guidance requires an entity to recognize revenue as performance obligations are met,

in order to reflect the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects
the consideration the entity is entitled to receive for those goods or services. The following steps are
applied in the updated guidance: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the
performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction
price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when, or as, the entity
satisfies a performance obligation.

The updated guidance is effective for the quarter ending March 31, 2018. The adoption of this

guidance is not expected to have any effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial position
or liquidity.

Financial Instruments—Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities

In January 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance to address the recognition, measurement,
presentation, and disclosure of certain financial instruments. The updated guidance requires equity
investments, except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, that have readily
determinable fair value to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net
income. Such equity investments are no longer required to be classified as available for sale or trading
securities. Equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values may be remeasured at
fair value either upon the occurrence of an observable price change or upon identification of an
impairment. A qualitative assessment for impairment is required for equity investments without readily
determinable fair values. The updated guidance also eliminates the requirement to disclose the method
and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments measured at
amortized cost on the balance sheet. The updated guidance is effective for the quarter ending
March 31, 2018 and will result in the recognition of $22 million of net after-tax unrealized gains on
equity investments as a cumulative effect adjustment that will increase retained earnings as of
January 1, 2018 and decrease accumulated other comprehensive income by a corresponding amount.

Leases

In February 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance to require lessees to recognize a right-to-use
asset and a lease liability for leases with terms of more than 12 months. The updated guidance retains
the two classifications of a lease as either an operating or finance lease (previously referred to as a
capital lease). Both lease classifications require the lessee to record the right-to-use asset and the lease
liability based upon the present value of cash flows. Finance leases will reflect the financial
arrangement by recognizing interest expense on the lease liability separately from the amortization
expense of the right-to-use asset. Operating leases will recognize lease expense (with no separate
recognition of interest expense) on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The accounting by
lessors is not significantly changed by the updated guidance. The updated guidance requires expanded
qualitative and quantitative disclosures, including additional information about the amounts recorded in
the financial statements.

The updated guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and

will require that the earliest comparative period presented include the measurement and recognition of

163

THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
existing leases with an adjustment to equity as if the updated guidance had always been applied. Early
adoption is permitted. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material effect on the
Company’s results of operations, financial position or liquidity.

Financial Instruments—Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments

In June 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance for the accounting for credit losses for financial
instruments. The updated guidance applies a new credit loss model (current expected credit losses or
CECL) for determining credit-related impairments for financial instruments measured at amortized cost
(e.g. reinsurance recoverables, including structured settlements that are recorded as part of reinsurance
recoverables) and requires an entity to estimate the credit losses expected over the life of an exposure
or pool of exposures. The estimate of expected credit losses should consider historical information,
current information, as well as reasonable and supportable forecasts, including estimates of
prepayments. The expected credit losses, and subsequent adjustments to such losses, will be recorded
through an allowance account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset, with
the net carrying value of the financial asset presented on the consolidated balance sheet at the amount
expected to be collected.

The updated guidance also amends the current other-than-temporary impairment model for

available-for-sale debt securities by requiring the recognition of impairments relating to credit losses
through an allowance account and limits the amount of credit loss to the difference between a
security’s amortized cost basis and its fair value. In addition, the length of time a security has been in
an unrealized loss position will no longer impact the determination of whether a credit loss exists.

The updated guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early
adoption is permitted for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Based on the financial
instruments currently held by the Company, there would not be a material effect on the Company’s
results of operations, financial position or liquidity if the new guidance were able to be adopted in the
current accounting period. The impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or
liquidity at the date of adoption of the updated guidance will be determined by the financial
instruments held by the Company and the economic conditions at that time.

Intangibles—Goodwill and Other

In January 2017, the FASB issued updated guidance that eliminates the requirement to calculate
the implied fair value of goodwill (i.e., Step 2 of the current goodwill impairment test) to measure a
goodwill impairment charge. Instead, entities will record an impairment charge by comparing a
reporting unit’s fair value with its carrying amount and recognizing an impairment charge for the excess
of the carrying amount over estimated fair value (i.e., Step 1 of current guidance). The implied fair
value of goodwill is currently determined in Step 2 by deducting the fair value of all assets and
liabilities of the reporting unit (determined in the same manner as a business combination) from the
reporting unit’s fair value as determined in Step 1 (including any corporate-level assets or liabilities that
were included in the determination of the carrying amount and fair value of the reporting unit in
Step 1). The updated guidance requires an entity to perform its annual, or interim, impairment test by
either: (1) an initial qualitative assessment of factors (such as changes in management, key personnel,
strategy, key technology or customers) that may impact a reporting unit’s fair value and lead to the

164

THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
determination that it is more likely than not that the reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying
value, including goodwill (consistent with current guidance), or (2) applying Step 1.

The updated guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and is

to be applied prospectively. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests
performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have
a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or liquidity.

Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income

On February 14, 2018, the FASB issued updated guidance that allows a reclassification of the

stranded tax effects in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) resulting from the Tax Cuts
and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA). Current guidance requires the effect of a change in tax laws or rates on
deferred tax balances to be reported in income from continuing operations in the accounting period
that includes the period of enactment, even if the related income tax effects were originally charged or
credited directly to AOCI. The amount of the reclassification would include the effect of the change in
the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate on the gross deferred tax amounts and related valuation
allowances, if any, at the date of the enactment of TCJA related to items in AOCI. The updated
guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and is to be applied
retrospectively to each period in which the effect of the TCJA related to items remaining in AOCI are
recognized or at the beginning of the period of adoption. Early adoption is permitted.

The Company expects to adopt the updated guidance effective January 1, 2018. The adoption will

not affect the Company’s results of operations, financial position, or liquidity.

Accounting Policies
Investments
Fixed Maturity and Equity Securities

Fixed maturities include bonds, notes and redeemable preferred stocks. Fixed maturities, including

instruments subject to securities lending agreements, are classified as available for sale and are
reported at fair value, with unrealized investment gains and losses, net of income taxes, charged or
credited directly to other comprehensive income. Equity securities, which include public common and
non-redeemable preferred stocks, are classified as available for sale and are reported at fair value with
unrealized gains and losses, net of income taxes, charged or credited directly to other comprehensive
income.

Real Estate Investments

The Company’s real estate investments include warehouses, office buildings and other commercial

land and properties that are directly owned. Real estate is recorded on the purchase date at the
purchase price, which generally represents fair value, and is supported by internal analysis or external
appraisals that use discounted cash flow analyses and other acceptable valuation techniques. Real estate
held for investment purposes is subsequently carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.

Buildings are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the expected useful life of the

building or 39 years. Real estate held for sale is carried at lower of cost or fair value, less estimated
costs to sell.

165

THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
Short-term Securities

Short-term securities have an original maturity of less than one year and are carried at amortized

cost, which approximates fair value.

Other Investments

Investments in Private Equity Limited Partnerships, Hedge Funds and Real Estate Partnerships
The Company uses the equity method of accounting for investments in private equity limited

partnerships, hedge funds and real estate partnerships. The partnerships and the hedge funds generally
report investments on their balance sheet at fair value. The financial statements prepared by the
investee are received by the Company on a lag basis, with the lag period generally dependent upon the
type of underlying investments. The private equity and real estate partnerships provide financial
information quarterly which is generally available to investors, including the Company, within three to
six months following the date of the reporting period. The hedge funds provide financial information
monthly, which is generally available to investors within one month following the date of the reporting
period. The Company regularly requests financial information from the partnerships prior to the receipt
of the partnerships’ financial statements and records any material information obtained from these
requests in its consolidated financial statements.

Other

Also included in other investments are non-public common equities, preferred equities and

derivatives. Non-public common equities and preferred equities are reported at fair value with changes
in fair value, net of income taxes, charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income. The
Company’s derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value, with the changes in fair value
reflected in the consolidated statements of income in net realized investment gains (losses). For a
further discussion of the derivatives used by the Company, see note 3.

Net Investment Income

Investment income from fixed maturities is recognized based on the constant effective yield

method which includes an adjustment for estimated principal pre-payments, if any. The effective yield
used to determine amortization for fixed maturities subject to prepayment risk (e.g., asset-backed,
loan-backed and structured securities) is recalculated and adjusted periodically based upon actual
historical and/or projected future cash flows, which are obtained from a widely-accepted securities data
provider. The adjustments to the yield for highly rated prepayable fixed maturities are accounted for
using the retrospective method. The adjustments to the yield for non-highly rated prepayable fixed
maturities are accounted for using the prospective method. Dividends on equity securities (including
those with transfer restrictions) are recognized in income when declared. Rental income on real estate
is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. See the section titled: ‘‘Real Estate’’ in note 3
for further discussion. Investments in private equity limited partnerships, hedge funds, real estate
partnerships and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, whereby the
Company’s share of the investee’s earnings or losses in the fund is reported in net investment income.

Accrual of income is suspended on non-securitized fixed maturities that are in default, or on which

it is likely that future payments will not be made as scheduled. Interest income on investments in

166

THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
default is recognized only when payments are received. Investments included in the consolidated
balance sheet that were not income-producing for the preceding 12 months were not material.
For fixed maturities where the Company records an other-than-temporary impairment, a

determination is made as to the cause of the impairment and whether the Company expects a recovery
in the value. For fixed maturities where the Company expects a recovery in value, not necessarily to
par, the constant effective yield method is utilized, and the investment is amortized to the expected
recovery amount.

Investment Gains and Losses

Net realized investment gains and losses are included as a component of pre-tax revenues based

upon specific identification of the investments sold on the trade date. Included in net realized
investment gains (losses) are other-than-temporary impairment losses on invested assets other than
those investments accounted for using the equity method of accounting as described in the ‘‘Investment
Impairments’’ section that follows.

Investment Impairments

The Company conducts a periodic review to identify and evaluate invested assets having

other-than-temporary impairments. Some of the factors considered in identifying other-than-temporary
impairments include: (1) for fixed maturity investments, whether the Company intends to sell the
investment or whether it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the
investment prior to an anticipated recovery in value; (2) for non-fixed maturity investments, the
Company’s ability and intent to retain the investment for a reasonable period of time sufficient to allow
for an anticipated recovery in value; (3) the likelihood of the recoverability of principal and interest for
fixed maturity securities (i.e., whether there is a credit loss) or cost for equity securities; (4) the length
of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost for fixed maturity
securities or cost for equity securities; and (5) the financial condition, near-term and long-term
prospects for the issuer, including the relevant industry conditions and trends, and implications of
rating agency actions and offering prices.

Other-Than-Temporary Impairments of Fixed Maturities and Equity Securities

For fixed maturity investments that the Company does not intend to sell or for which it is more

likely than not that the Company would not be required to sell before an anticipated recovery in value,
the Company separates the credit loss component of the impairment from the amount related to all
other factors and reports the credit loss component in net realized investment gains (losses). The
impairment related to all other factors is reported in other comprehensive income.

For equity securities (including public common and non-redeemable preferred stock) and for fixed

maturity investments the Company intends to sell or for which it is more likely than not that the
Company will be required to sell before an anticipated recovery in value, the full amount of the
impairment is included in net realized investment gains (losses).

Upon recognizing an other-than-temporary impairment, the new cost basis of the investment is the

previous amortized cost basis less the other-than-temporary impairment recognized in net realized
investment gains (losses). The new cost basis is not adjusted for any subsequent recoveries in fair value;
however, for fixed maturity investments the difference between the new cost basis and the expected

167

THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
cash flows is accreted on a quarterly basis to net investment income over the remaining expected life of
the investment.

Determination of Credit Loss—Fixed Maturities

The Company determines the credit loss component of fixed maturity investments by utilizing

discounted cash flow modeling to determine the present value of the security and comparing the
present value with the amortized cost of the security. If the amortized cost is greater than the present
value of the expected cash flows, the difference is considered a credit loss and recognized in net
realized investment gains (losses).

For non-structured fixed maturities (U.S. Treasury securities, obligations of U.S. government and

government agencies and authorities, obligations of states, municipalities and political subdivisions, debt
securities issued by foreign governments and certain corporate debt), the estimate of expected cash
flows is determined by projecting a recovery value and a recovery time frame and assessing whether
further principal and interest will be received. The determination of recovery value incorporates an
issuer valuation assumption utilizing one or a combination of valuation methods as deemed appropriate
by the Company. The Company determines the undiscounted recovery value by allocating the estimated
value of the issuer to the Company’s assessment of the priority of claims. The present value of the cash
flows is determined by applying the effective yield of the security at the date of acquisition (or the most
recent implied rate used to accrete the security if the implied rate has changed as a result of a previous
impairment) and an estimated recovery time frame. Generally, that time frame for securities for which
the issuer is in bankruptcy is 12 months. For securities for which the issuer is financially troubled but
not in bankruptcy, that time frame is generally 24 months. Included in the present value calculation are
expected principal and interest payments; however, for securities for which the issuer is classified as
bankrupt or in default, the present value calculation assumes no interest payments and a single
recovery amount.

In estimating the recovery value, significant judgment is involved in the development of

assumptions relating to a myriad of factors related to the issuer including, but not limited to, revenue,
margin and earnings projections, the likely market or liquidation values of assets, potential additional
debt to be incurred pre- or post-bankruptcy/restructuring, the ability to shift existing or new debt to
different priority layers, the amount of restructuring/bankruptcy expenses, the size and priority of
unfunded pension obligations, litigation or other contingent claims, the treatment of intercompany
claims and the likely outcome with respect to inter-creditor conflicts.

For structured fixed maturity securities (primarily residential and commercial mortgage-backed
securities and asset-backed securities), the Company estimates the present value of the security by
projecting future cash flows of the assets underlying the securitization, allocating the flows to the
various tranches based on the structure of the securitization and determining the present value of the
cash flows using the effective yield of the security at the date of acquisition (or the most recent implied
rate used to accrete the security if the implied rate has changed as a result of a previous impairment or
changes in expected cash flows). The Company incorporates levels of delinquencies, defaults and
severities as well as credit attributes of the remaining assets in the securitization, along with other
economic data, to arrive at its best estimate of the parameters applied to the assets underlying the
securitization. In order to project cash flows, the following assumptions are applied to the assets
underlying the securitization: (1) voluntary prepayment rates, (2) default rates and (3) loss severity. The

168

30% - 65% 38% - 80% 75% - 110%

On at least an annual basis, the Company obtains independent appraisals for substantially all of its

real estate investments. In addition, the carrying value of all real estate investments is reviewed for
impairment on a quarterly basis or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount may not be recoverable. The review for impairment considers the valuation from the
independent appraisal, when applicable, and incorporates an estimate of the undiscounted cash flows
expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the real estate property. An impairment loss
is recognized if the expected future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the real
estate property. The impairment loss is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds fair value.

Other Investments
Investments in Private Equity Limited Partnerships, Hedge Funds and Real Estate Partnerships

The Company reviews its investments in private equity limited partnerships, hedge funds and real

estate partnerships for impairment no less frequently than quarterly and monitors the performance
throughout the year through discussions with the managers/general partners. If the Company becomes
aware of an impairment of a partnership’s investments at the balance sheet date prior to receiving the
partnership’s financial statements, it will recognize an impairment by recording a reduction in the
carrying value of the partnership with a corresponding charge to net investment income.

Changes in Intent to Sell Temporarily Impaired Assets

The Company may, from time to time, sell invested assets subsequent to the balance sheet date

that it did not intend to sell at the balance sheet date. Conversely, the Company may not sell invested
assets that it asserted that it intended to sell at the balance sheet date. Such changes in intent are due
to events occurring subsequent to the balance sheet date. The types of events that may result in a
change in intent include, but are not limited to, significant changes in the economic facts and
circumstances related to the invested asset (e.g., a downgrade or upgrade from a rating agency),
significant unforeseen changes in liquidity needs, or changes in tax laws or the regulatory environment.

Securities Lending

The Company has, from time to time, engaged in securities lending activities from which it

generates net investment income by lending certain of its investments to other institutions for short
periods of time. Borrowers of these securities provide collateral equal to at least 102% of the market
value of the loaned securities plus accrued interest. This collateral is held by a third-party custodian,
and the Company has the right to access the collateral only in the event that the institution borrowing
the Company’s securities is in default under the lending agreement. Therefore, the Company does not

169

THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
recognize the receipt of the collateral held by the third-party custodian or the obligation to return the
collateral. The loaned securities remain a recorded asset of the Company. The Company accepts only
cash as collateral for securities on loan and restricts the manner in which that cash is invested.

Reinsurance Recoverables

Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the associated
claim liability. The Company reports its reinsurance recoverables net of an allowance for estimated
uncollectible reinsurance recoverables. The allowance is based upon the Company’s ongoing review of
amounts outstanding, length of collection periods, changes in reinsurer credit standing, disputes,
applicable coverage defenses and other relevant factors. Amounts deemed to be uncollectible, including
amounts due from known insolvent reinsurers, are written off against the allowance for estimated
uncollectible reinsurance recoverables. Any subsequent collections of amounts previously written off are
reported as part of claims and claim adjustment expenses. The Company evaluates and monitors the
financial condition of its reinsurers under voluntary reinsurance arrangements to minimize its exposure
to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies.

Deferred Acquisition Costs

Incremental direct costs of acquired, new and renewal insurance contracts, consisting of

commissions (other than contingent commissions) and premium-related taxes, are capitalized and
charged to expense pro rata over the contract periods in which the related premiums are earned.
Deferred acquisition costs are reviewed to determine if they are recoverable from future income and, if
not, are charged to expense. Future investment income attributable to related premiums is taken into
account in measuring the recoverability of the carrying value of this asset. All other acquisition
expenses are charged to operations as incurred.

Contractholder Receivables and Payables

Under certain workers’ compensation insurance contracts with deductible features, the Company is

obligated to pay the claimant for the full amount of the claim. The Company is subsequently
reimbursed by the policyholder for the deductible amount. These amounts are included on a gross basis
in the consolidated balance sheets in contractholder payables and contractholder receivables,
respectively.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

The Company performs a review, on at least an annual basis, of goodwill held by the reporting

units which are the Company’s three operating and reportable segments: Business Insurance; Bond &
Specialty Insurance; and Personal Insurance. The Company estimates the fair value of its reporting
units and compares it to their carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying values of the reporting
units were to exceed their fair value, the amount of the impairment would be calculated and goodwill
adjusted accordingly.

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

The Company uses a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of its reporting units.
The discounted cash flow model is an income approach to valuation that is based on a detailed cash
flow analysis for deriving a current fair value of reporting units and is representative of the Company’s
reporting units’ current and expected future financial performance. The discount rate assumptions
reflect the Company’s assessment of the risks inherent in the projected future cash flows and the
Company’s weighted-average cost of capital, and are compared against available market data for
reasonableness.

Other indefinite-lived intangible assets held by the Company are also reviewed for impairment on

at least an annual basis. The classification of the asset as indefinite-lived is reassessed and an
impairment is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value.

Intangible assets that are deemed to have a finite useful life are amortized over their useful lives.
The carrying amount of intangible assets with a finite useful life is regularly reviewed for indicators of
impairment in value. Impairment is recognized only if the carrying amount of the intangible asset is not
recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows and is measured as the difference between the carrying
amount and the fair value of the asset.

As a result of the reviews performed for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the
Company determined that the estimated fair value substantially exceeded the respective carrying value
of its reporting units for those years and that goodwill was not impaired. The Company also
determined during its reviews for each year that its other indefinite-lived intangible assets and finite-
lived intangible assets were not impaired.

Claims and Claim Adjustment Expense Reserves

Claims and claim adjustment expense reserves represent estimates for the ultimate cost of unpaid

reported and unreported claims incurred and related expenses. The reserves are adjusted regularly
based upon experience. Included in the claims and claim adjustment expense reserves in the
consolidated balance sheets are reserves for long-term disability and annuity claim payments, primarily
arising from workers’ compensation insurance and workers’ compensation excess insurance policies, that
are discounted to the present value of estimated future payments.

The Company performs a continuing review of its claims and claim adjustment expense reserves,

including its reserving techniques and the impact of reinsurance. The reserves are also reviewed
regularly by qualified actuaries employed by the Company. Since the reserves are based on estimates,
the ultimate liability may be more or less than such reserves. The effects of changes in such estimated
reserves are included in the results of operations in the period in which the estimates are changed.
Such changes in estimates could occur in a future period and may be material to the Company’s results
of operations and financial position in such period.

Other Liabilities

Included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets is the Company’s estimate of its
liability for guaranty fund and other insurance-related assessments. The liability for expected state
guaranty fund and other premium-based assessments is recognized as the Company writes or becomes
obligated to write or renew the premiums on which the assessments are expected to be based. The
liability for loss-based assessments is recognized as the related losses are incurred. At December 31,

171

THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
2017 and 2016, the Company had a liability of $231 million and $242 million, respectively, for guaranty
fund and other insurance-related assessments and related recoverables of $16 million at both dates. The
liability for such assessments and the related recoverables are not discounted for the time value of
money. The loss-based assessments are expected to be paid over a period ranging from one year to the
life expectancy of certain workers’ compensation claimants and the recoveries are expected to occur
over the same period of time.

Also included in other liabilities is an accrual for policyholder dividends. Certain insurance

contracts, primarily workers’ compensation, are participating whereby dividends are paid to
policyholders in accordance with contract provisions. Net written premiums for participating dividend
policies were approximately 1%, 1% and 2% of total net written premiums for the years ended
December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Policyholder dividends are accrued against earnings
using best available estimates of amounts to be paid. The liability accrued for policyholder dividends
totaled $67 million and $62 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Treasury Stock

The cost of common stock repurchased by the Company is reported as treasury stock and

represents authorized and unissued shares of the Company under the Minnesota Business Corporation
Act.

Statutory Accounting Practices

The Company’s U.S. insurance subsidiaries, domiciled principally in the State of Connecticut, are

required to prepare statutory financial statements in accordance with the accounting practices
prescribed or permitted by the insurance departments of the states of domicile. Prescribed statutory
accounting practices are those practices that are incorporated directly or by reference in state laws,
regulations, and general administrative rules applicable to all insurance enterprises domiciled in a
particular state. The State of Connecticut requires insurers domiciled in Connecticut to prepare their
statutory financial statements in accordance with National Association of Insurance Commissioners’
(NAIC) statutory accounting practices.

Permitted statutory accounting practices are those practices that differ either from state-prescribed

statutory accounting practices or NAIC statutory accounting practices.

The Company does not apply any statutory accounting practices that would be considered a

prescribed or permitted statutory accounting practice that differs from NAIC statutory accounting
practices.

The Company’s non-U.S. insurance subsidiaries file financial statements prepared in accordance

with the regulatory reporting requirements of their respective local jurisdiction.

Premiums and Unearned Premium Reserves

Premiums are recognized as revenues pro rata over the policy period. Unearned premium reserves

represent the unexpired portion of policy premiums. Accrued retrospective premiums are included in
premium balances receivable. Premium balances receivable are reported net of an allowance for
estimated uncollectible premium amounts.

172

THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

Ceded premiums are charged to income over the applicable term of the various reinsurance

contracts with third party reinsurers. Prepaid reinsurance premiums represent the unexpired portion of
premiums ceded to reinsurers and are reported as part of other assets.

Fee Income

Fee income includes servicing fees from carriers and revenues from large deductible policies and

service contracts and is recognized pro rata over the contract or policy periods.

Other Revenues

Other revenues include revenues from premium installment charges, which are recognized as

collected, revenues of noninsurance subsidiaries other than fee income and gains and losses on
dispositions of assets and redemption of debt, and other miscellaneous revenues, including a gain
recognized as a result of the settlement of a reinsurance dispute.

Income Taxes

The Company recognizes deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax

effects attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement and tax return bases of
assets and liabilities, based on enacted tax rates and other provisions of the tax law. The effect of a
change in tax laws or rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period in
which such change is enacted. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more
likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Foreign Currency Translation

The Company assigns functional currencies to its foreign operations, which are generally the
currencies of the local operating environment. Foreign currency amounts are remeasured to the
functional currency, and the resulting foreign exchange gains or losses are reflected in earnings.
Functional currency amounts are then translated into U.S. dollars. The foreign currency remeasurement
and translation are calculated using current exchange rates for items reported in the balance sheets and
average exchange rates for items recorded in earnings. The change in unrealized foreign currency
translation gain or loss during the year, net of tax, is a component of other comprehensive income.

Share-Based Compensation

The Company has an employee stock incentive compensation plan that permits grants of

nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, deferred
stock, stock units, performance awards and other share-based or share-denominated awards with
respect to the Company’s common stock.

Compensation cost is measured based on the grant-date fair value of an award, utilizing the

assumptions discussed in note 13. Compensation cost is recognized for financial reporting purposes
over the period in which the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award
(generally the vesting period). In connection with certain share-based awards, participants are entitled
to receive dividends during the vesting period, either in cash or dividend equivalent shares,
commensurate with the dividends paid to common shareholders. Dividends and dividend equivalent

173

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
shares on awards that are expected to vest are recorded in retained earnings. Dividends paid on awards
that are not expected to vest as part of the Company’s forfeiture estimate are recorded as
compensation expense.

Nature of Operations

Effective April 1, 2017, the Company’s results are reported in the following three business

segments—Business Insurance, Bond & Specialty Insurance and Personal Insurance, reflecting a change
in the manner in which the Company’s businesses were being managed as of that date, as well as the
aggregation of products and services based on the type of customer, how the business is marketed and
the manner in which risks are underwritten. While the segmentation of the Company’s domestic
businesses was unchanged, the Company’s international businesses, which were previously managed and
reported in total within the Business and International Insurance segment, were disaggregated by
product type among the three newly aligned reportable business segments. All prior periods presented
have been reclassified to conform to this presentation. In connection with these changes, the Company
revised the names and descriptions of certain businesses comprising the Company’s segments and has
reflected other related changes. The reportable business segments are as follows:

Business Insurance

services to its customers, primarily in the United States, as well as in Canada, the United Kingdom, the
Republic of Ireland, Brazil and throughout other parts of the world as a corporate member of Lloyd’s.

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

Personal Insurance

Personal Insurance writes a broad range of property and casualty insurance covering individuals’

personal risks, primarily in the United States, as well as in Canada. The primary products of
automobile and homeowners insurance are complemented by a broad suite of related coverages.

Automobile policies provide coverage for liability to others for both bodily injury and property
damage, uninsured motorist protection, and for physical damage to an insured’s own vehicle from
collision, fire, flood, hail and theft. In addition, many states require policies to provide first-party
personal injury protection, frequently referred to as no-fault coverage.

Homeowners policies provide protection against losses to dwellings and contents from a variety of
perils (excluding flooding) as well as coverage for personal liability. The Company writes homeowners
insurance for dwellings, condominiums and tenants, and rental properties. The Company also writes
coverage for boats and yachts and valuable personal items such as jewelry, and also writes coverages for
umbrella liability, identity fraud, and weddings and special events.

2. SEGMENT INFORMATION

The accounting policies used to prepare the segment reporting data for the Company’s three

reportable business segments are the same as those described in the Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies in note 1.

Except as described below for certain legal entities, the Company allocates its invested assets and

the related net investment income to its reportable business segments. Pre-tax net investment income is
allocated based upon an investable funds concept, which takes into account liabilities (net of
non-invested assets) and appropriate capital considerations for each segment. For investable funds, a
benchmark investment yield is developed that reflects the estimated duration of the loss reserves’ future
cash flows, the interest rate environment at the time the losses were incurred and A+ rated corporate
debt instrument yields. For capital, a benchmark investment yield is developed that reflects the average
yield on the total investment portfolio. The benchmark investment yields are applied to each segment’s
investable funds and capital, respectively, to produce a total notional investment income by segment.
The Company’s actual net investment income is allocated to each segment in proportion to the
respective segment’s notional investment income to total notional investment income. There are certain
legal entities within the Company that are dedicated to specific reportable business segments. The
invested assets and related net investment income from these legal entities are reported in the
applicable business segment and are not allocated among the other business segments.

The cost of the Company’s catastrophe treaty program is included in the Company’s ceded

premiums and is allocated among reportable business segments based on an estimate of actual market
reinsurance pricing using expected losses calculated by the Company’s catastrophe model, adjusted for
any experience adjustments.

Pre-refunded bonds of $3.90 billion and $5.16 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively,

were bonds for which states or municipalities have established irrevocable trusts, almost exclusively
comprised of U.S. Treasury securities and obligations of U.S. government and government agencies and
authorities. These trusts were created to fund the payment of principal and interest due under the
bonds.

The Company’s fixed maturity investment portfolio at December 31, 2017 and 2016 included

$2.41 billion and $1.71 billion, respectively, of residential mortgage-backed securities, which include
pass-through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs). Included in the totals at
December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $804 million and $563 million, respectively, of GNMA, FNMA,
FHLMC (excluding FHA project loans) and Canadian government guaranteed residential mortgage-
backed pass-through securities classified as available for sale. Also included in those totals were
residential CMOs classified as available for sale with a fair value of $1.61 billion and $1.15 billion at
December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Approximately 55% and 51% of the Company’s CMO
holdings at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, were guaranteed by or fully collateralized by
securities issued by GNMA, FNMA or FHLMC. The weighted average credit rating of the $717 million
and $566 million of non-guaranteed CMO holdings at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, was
‘‘A1’’ and ‘‘Baa2,’’ respectively. The weighted average credit rating of all of the above securities was
‘‘Aa1’’ and ‘‘Aa2’’ at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company held commercial mortgage-backed securities
(CMBS, including FHA project loans) of $1.17 billion and $938 million, respectively, which are
included in ‘‘All other corporate bonds’’ in the tables above. At December 31, 2017 and 2016,
approximately $475 million and $290 million of these securities, respectively, or the loans backing such
securities, contained guarantees by the U.S. government or a government-sponsored enterprise. The
weighted average credit rating of the $693 million and $648 million of non-guaranteed securities at
December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, was ‘‘Aaa’’ at both dates. The CMBS portfolio is supported
by loans that are diversified across economic sectors and geographical areas. The weighted average
credit rating of the CMBS portfolio was ‘‘Aaa’’ at both December 31, 2017 and 2016.

3. INVESTMENTS (Continued)

Real Estate

The Company’s real estate investments include warehouses, office buildings and other commercial
land and properties that are directly owned. The Company negotiates commercial leases with individual
tenants through unrelated, licensed real estate brokers. Negotiated terms and conditions include, among
others, rental rates, length of lease period and improvements to the premises to be provided by the
landlord.

Proceeds from the sale of real estate investments were $23 million, $69 million and $31 million in
2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Gross gains of $10 million, $7 million and $4 million were realized
on those sales in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and there were no gross losses. Accumulated
depreciation on real estate held for investment purposes was $364 million and $332 million at
December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Future minimum rental income on operating leases relating to the Company’s real estate

properties is expected to be $90 million, $85 million, $70 million, $56 million and $44 million for 2018,
2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively, and $58 million for 2023 and thereafter.

Short-term Securities

The Company’s short-term securities consist of Aaa-rated registered money market funds, U.S.

Treasury securities, high-quality commercial paper (primarily A1/P1) and high-quality corporate
securities purchased within a year to their maturity with a combined average of 71 days to maturity at
December 31, 2017. The amortized cost of these securities, which totaled $4.90 billion and $4.87 billion
at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, approximated their fair value.

Variable Interest Entities

Entities which do not have sufficient equity at risk to allow the entity to finance its activities
without additional financial support or in which the equity investors, as a group, do not have the
characteristic of a controlling financial interest are referred to as variable interest entities (VIE). A
VIE is consolidated by the variable interest holder that is determined to have the controlling financial
interest (primary beneficiary) as a result of having both the power to direct the activities of a VIE that
most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or right
to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The Company
determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of an entity subject to consolidation based on a
qualitative assessment of the VIE’s capital structure, contractual terms, nature of the VIE’s operations
and purpose and the Company’s relative exposure to the related risks of the VIE on the date it
becomes initially involved in the VIE. The Company reassesses its VIE determination with respect to
an entity on an ongoing basis.

The Company is a passive investor in limited partner equity interests issued by third party VIEs.

These include certain of the Company’s investments in private equity limited partnerships, hedge funds
and real estate partnerships where the Company is not related to the general partner. These
investments are generally accounted for under the equity method and reported in the Company’s
consolidated balance sheet as other investments unless the Company is deemed the primary beneficiary.
These equity interests generally cannot be redeemed. Distributions from these investments are received
by the Company as a result of liquidation of the underlying investments of the funds and/or as income

distribution. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss with respect to these investments is limited to
the investment carrying amounts reported in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet and any
unfunded commitment. The Company considers an investment in a VIE in which it has a 20% or
greater equity interest as a significant VIE. Neither the Company’s carrying amounts nor the unfunded
commitments related to these significant VIE’s are material individually or in the aggregate.

Unrealized Investment Losses

The following tables summarize, for all investments in an unrealized loss position at December 31,

2017 and 2016, the aggregate fair value and gross unrealized loss by length of time those securities
have been continuously in an unrealized loss position. The fair value amounts reported in the tables are
estimates that are prepared using the process described in note 4. The Company also relies upon
estimates of several factors in its review and evaluation of individual investments, using the process
described in note 1, in determining whether such investments are other-than-temporarily impaired.

Concentrations and Credit Quality

Concentrations of credit risk arise from exposure to counterparties that are engaged in similar
activities and have similar economic characteristics that could cause their ability to meet contractual
obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. The Company seeks to
mitigate credit risk by actively monitoring the creditworthiness of counterparties, obtaining collateral as
deemed appropriate and applying controls that include credit approvals, limits of credit exposure and
other monitoring procedures.

At December 31, 2017 and 2016, other than U.S. Treasury securities and obligations of U.S.

government and government agencies and authorities, the Company was not exposed to any
concentration of credit risk of a single issuer greater than 5% of the Company’s shareholders’ equity.

Included in fixed maturities are below investment grade securities totaling $1.67 billion and

$1.76 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company defines its below investment
grade securities as those securities rated below investment grade by external rating agencies, or the
equivalent by the Company when a public rating does not exist. Such securities include below
investment grade bonds that are publicly traded and certain other privately issued bonds that are
classified as below investment grade loans.

The total impact of net unrealized gains on investment securities was $1.11 billion after-tax at
December 31, 2017, which included the $954 million reported in accumulated other comprehensive
income shown above, as well as $158 million included in retained earnings that was part of the impact
of enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 recorded in earnings.

Derivative Financial Instruments

From time to time, the Company enters into U.S. Treasury note futures contracts to modify the

effective duration of specific assets within the investment portfolio. U.S. Treasury futures contracts
require a daily mark-to-market and settlement with the broker. At both December 31, 2017 and 2016,
the Company had $400 million notional value of open U.S. Treasury futures contracts. Net realized
investment losses related to U.S. Treasury futures contracts in 2017, 2016 and 2015 were not significant.

The Company also sells a small amount of U.S. equity index put option contracts that are settled
for cash upon their expiration or when they are rolled over. Net realized investment losses related to
these derivatives in 2017, 2016 and 2015 were not significant.

4. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The Company’s estimates of fair value for financial assets and financial liabilities are based on the

framework established in the fair value accounting guidance. The framework is based on the inputs
used in valuation, gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and requires that
observable inputs be used in the valuations when available. The disclosure of fair value estimates in the
fair value accounting guidance hierarchy is based on whether the significant inputs into the valuation
are observable. In determining the level of the hierarchy in which the estimate is disclosed, the highest
priority is given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable
inputs that reflect the Company’s significant market assumptions. The level in the fair value hierarchy

189

THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

4. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (Continued)
within which the fair value measurement is reported is based on the lowest level input that is significant
to the measurement in its entirety. The three levels of the hierarchy are as follows:

(cid:127) Level 1—Unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that

the Company has the ability to access.

(cid:127) Level 2—Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for

identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets; or valuations based on models where
the significant inputs are observable (e.g., interest rates, yield curves, prepayment speeds, default
rates, loss severities, etc.) or can be corroborated by observable market data.

(cid:127) Level 3—Valuations based on models where significant inputs are not observable. The

unobservable inputs reflect the Company’s own assumptions about the inputs that market
participants would use.

Valuation of Investments Reported at Fair Value in Financial Statements

The fair value of a financial instrument is the estimated amount at which the instrument could be

exchanged in an orderly transaction between knowledgeable, unrelated, willing parties, i.e., not in a
forced transaction. The estimated fair value of a financial instrument may differ from the amount that
could be realized if the security was sold in an immediate sale, e.g., a forced transaction. Additionally,
the valuation of investments is more subjective when markets are less liquid due to the lack of market
based inputs, which may increase the potential that the estimated fair value of an investment is not
reflective of the price at which an actual transaction would occur.

For investments that have quoted market prices in active markets, the Company uses the

unadjusted quoted market prices as fair value and includes these prices in the amounts disclosed in
Level 1 of the hierarchy. The Company receives the quoted market prices from third party, nationally
recognized pricing services. When quoted market prices are unavailable, the Company utilizes these
pricing services to determine an estimate of fair value. The fair value estimates provided from these
pricing services are included in the amount disclosed in Level 2 of the hierarchy. If quoted market
prices and an estimate from a pricing service are unavailable, the Company produces an estimate of
fair value based on internally developed valuation techniques, which, depending on the level of
observable market inputs, will render the fair value estimate as Level 2 or Level 3. The Company bases
all of its estimates of fair value for assets on the bid price as it represents what a third-party market
participant would be willing to pay in an arm’s length transaction.

Fixed Maturities

The Company utilized a pricing service to estimate fair value measurements for approximately 98%

of its fixed maturities at both December 31, 2017 and 2016. The pricing service utilizes market
quotations for fixed maturity securities that have quoted prices in active markets. Since fixed maturities
other than U.S. Treasury securities generally do not trade on a daily basis, the pricing service prepares
estimates of fair value measurements for these securities using its proprietary pricing applications,
which include available relevant market information, benchmark curves, benchmarking of like securities,
sector groupings and matrix pricing. Additionally, the pricing service uses an Option Adjusted Spread
model to develop prepayment and interest rate scenarios.

190

THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

4. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (Continued)

The pricing service evaluates each asset class based on relevant market information, relevant credit

information, perceived market movements and sector news. The market inputs utilized in the pricing
evaluation, listed in the approximate order of priority, include: benchmark yields, reported trades,
broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, reference
data, and industry and economic events. The extent of the use of each market input depends on the
asset class and the market conditions. Depending on the security, the priority of the use of inputs may
change or some market inputs may not be relevant. For some securities, additional inputs may be
necessary.

The pricing service utilized by the Company has indicated that it will only produce an estimate of

fair value if there is objectively verifiable information to produce a valuation. If the pricing service
discontinues pricing an investment, the Company would be required to produce an estimate of fair
value using some of the same methodologies as the pricing service but would have to make
assumptions for any market-based inputs that were unavailable due to market conditions. The Company
reviews the estimates of fair value provided by the pricing service and compares the estimates to the
Company’s knowledge of the market to determine if the estimates obtained are representative of the
prices in the market. In addition, the Company has periodic discussions with the pricing service to
discuss and understand any changes in process and their responsiveness to changes occurring in the
markets. The Company also monitors all monthly price changes and further evaluates any securities
whose value changed more than 10% from the prior month. The Company has implemented various
other processes including randomly selecting purchased or sold securities and comparing execution
prices to the estimates from the pricing service as well as reviewing securities whose valuation did not
change from their previous valuation (stale price review). The Company also uses a second
independent pricing service to further test the primary pricing service’s valuation of the Company’s
fixed maturity portfolio. These processes have not highlighted any significant issues with the fair value
estimates received from the primary pricing service.

The fair value estimates of most fixed maturity investments are based on observable market

information rather than market quotes. Accordingly, the estimates of fair value for such fixed
maturities, other than U.S. Treasury securities, provided by the pricing service are included in the
amount disclosed in Level 2 of the hierarchy. The estimated fair value of U.S. Treasury securities is
included in the amount disclosed in Level 1 as the estimates are based on unadjusted market prices.
The Company also holds certain fixed maturity investments which are not priced by the pricing

service and, accordingly, estimates the fair value of such fixed maturities using an internal matrix that is
based on market information regarding interest rates, credit spreads and liquidity. The underlying
source data for calculating the matrix of credit spreads relative to the U.S. Treasury curve are
observable market-based indices that relate to corporate and high-yield fixed maturity investments. The
Company includes the fair value estimates of these corporate bonds in Level 2, since all significant
inputs are market observable.

While the vast majority of the Company’s fixed maturities are included in Level 2, the Company
holds a number of municipal bonds and corporate bonds which are not valued by the pricing service
and estimates the fair value of these bonds using an internal pricing matrix with some unobservable
inputs that are significant to the valuation. Due to the limited amount of observable market
information, the Company includes the fair value estimates for these particular bonds in Level 3. The
fair value of the fixed maturities for which the Company used an internal pricing matrix was

191

THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

4. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (Continued)
$127 million and $99 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Additionally, the Company
holds a small amount of other fixed maturity investments that have characteristics that make them
unsuitable for matrix pricing. For these fixed maturities, the Company obtains a quote from a broker
(primarily the market maker). The fair value of the fixed maturities for which the Company received a
broker quote was $77 million and $85 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Due to the
disclaimers on the quotes that indicate that the price is indicative only, the Company includes these fair
value estimates in Level 3.

Equity Securities—Public Common Stock and Non-Redeemable Preferred Stock

For public common stock and non-redeemable preferred stocks, the Company receives prices from

pricing services that are based on observable market transactions and includes these estimates in the
amount disclosed in Level 1. When current market quotes in active markets are unavailable for certain
non-redeemable preferred stocks held by the Company, the Company receives an estimate of fair value
from the pricing services. The services utilize similar methodologies to price the non-redeemable
preferred stocks as they do for the fixed maturities. The Company includes the fair value estimate for
these non-redeemable preferred stocks in the amount disclosed in Level 2.

Other Investments

The Company holds investments in various publicly-traded securities which are reported in other

investments. These investments include mutual funds and other small holdings. The $19 million and
$17 million fair value of these investments at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, was disclosed
in Level 1. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company held investments in non-public common and
preferred equity securities, with fair value estimates of $38 million and $36 million, respectively,
reported in other investments, where the fair value estimate is determined either internally or by an
external fund manager based on recent filings, operating results, balance sheet stability, growth and
other business and market sector fundamentals. Due to the significant unobservable inputs in these
valuations, the Company includes the total fair value estimate for all of these investments at
December 31, 2017 and 2016 in the amount disclosed in Level 3.

The Company utilized a pricing service and other market observable inputs to estimate fair value
for approximately 97% and 99% of short-term securities at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
A description of the process and inputs used by the pricing service to estimate fair value is discussed in
the ‘‘Fixed Maturities’’ section above. Estimates of fair value for U.S. Treasury securities and money
market funds are based on market quotations received from the pricing service and are disclosed in
Level 1 of the hierarchy. The fair value of other short-term fixed maturity securities is estimated by the
pricing service using observable market inputs and is disclosed in Level 2 of the hierarchy. For
short-term securities where an estimate is not obtained from the pricing service, the carrying value
approximates fair value and is included in Level 3 of the hierarchy.

The Company utilized a pricing service to estimate fair value for 100% of its debt, including

commercial paper, at December 31, 2017 and 2016. The pricing service utilizes market quotations for
debt that have quoted prices in active markets. Since fixed maturities other than U.S. Treasury
securities generally do not trade on a daily basis, the fair value estimates are based on market
observable inputs and disclosed in Level 2 of the hierarchy.

The Company had no material assets or liabilities that were measured at fair value on a

non-recurring basis during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.

5. REINSURANCE

The Company’s consolidated financial statements reflect the effects of assumed and ceded

reinsurance transactions. Assumed reinsurance refers to the acceptance of certain insurance risks that
other insurance companies have underwritten. Ceded reinsurance involves transferring certain insurance
risks (along with the related written and earned premiums) the Company has underwritten to other

195

THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

5. REINSURANCE (Continued)
insurance companies who agree to share these risks. The primary purpose of ceded reinsurance is to
protect the Company, at a cost, from losses in excess of the amount it is prepared to accept and to
protect the Company’s capital. Reinsurance is placed on both a quota-share and excess-of-loss basis.
Ceded reinsurance arrangements do not discharge the Company as the primary insurer, except for
instances where the primary policy or policies have been novated, such as in certain structured
settlement agreements.

The Company utilizes a corporate catastrophe excess-of-loss reinsurance treaty with unaffiliated
reinsurers to manage its exposure to losses resulting from catastrophes and to protect its capital. In
addition to the coverage provided under this treaty, the Company also utilizes catastrophe bonds to
protect against certain weather-related and earthquake losses in the Northeastern United States, and a
Northeast catastrophe reinsurance treaty to protect against losses resulting from weather-related and
earthquake catastrophes in the Northeastern United States. The Company also utilizes excess-of-loss
treaties to protect against earthquake losses up to a certain threshold in Business Insurance (for certain
markets) and for Personal Insurance, and several reinsurance treaties specific to its international
operations.

The Company monitors the financial condition of its reinsurers under voluntary reinsurance

arrangements to evaluate the collectability of amounts due from reinsurers and as a basis for
determining the reinsurers with which the Company conducts ongoing business. In addition, in the
ordinary course of business, the Company may become involved in coverage disputes with its reinsurers.
Some of these disputes could result in lawsuits and arbitrations brought by or against the reinsurers to
determine the Company’s rights and obligations under the various reinsurance agreements. The
Company employs dedicated specialists and strategies to manage reinsurance collections and disputes.

Included in reinsurance recoverables are amounts related to involuntary reinsurance arrangements.

The Company is required to participate in various involuntary reinsurance arrangements through
assumed reinsurance, principally with regard to residual market mechanisms in workers’ compensation
and automobile insurance, as well as homeowners’ insurance in certain coastal areas. In addition, the
Company provides services for several of these involuntary arrangements (mandatory pools and
associations) under which it writes such residual market business directly, then cedes 100% of this
business to the mandatory pool. Such participations and servicing arrangements are arranged to
mitigate credit risk to the Company, as any ceded balances are jointly backed by all the pool members.

Also included in reinsurance recoverables are amounts related to certain structured settlements.
Structured settlements are annuities purchased from various life insurance companies to settle certain
personal physical injury claims, of which workers’ compensation claims comprise a significant portion.
In cases where the Company did not receive a release from the claimant, the structured settlement is
included in reinsurance recoverables and the related claim cost is included in the liability for claims and
claim adjustment expense reserves, as the Company retains the contingent liability to the claimant. If it
is expected that the life insurance company is not able to pay, the Company would recognize an
impairment of the related reinsurance recoverable if, and to the extent, the purchased annuities are not
covered by state guaranty associations. In the event that the life insurance company fails to make the
required annuity payments, the Company would be required to make such payments.

Terrorism Risk Insurance Program

The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program is a Federal program administered by the Department of
the Treasury authorized through December 31, 2020 that provides for a system of shared public and
private compensation for certain insured losses resulting from certified acts of terrorism.

In order for a loss to be covered under the program (subject losses), the loss must meet certain

aggregate industry loss minimums and must be the result of an event that is certified as an act of
terrorism by the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland
Security and the Attorney General of the United States. The annual aggregate industry loss minimum
under the program is $160 million for 2018, but will increase over the life of the program to

197

THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

5. REINSURANCE (Continued)
$200 million by December 31, 2020. The program excludes from participation the following types of
insurance: Federal crop insurance, private mortgage insurance, financial guaranty insurance, medical
malpractice insurance, health or life insurance, flood insurance, reinsurance, commercial automobile,
professional liability (other than directors’ and officers’), surety, burglary and theft, and farm-owners
multi-peril. In the case of a war declared by Congress, only workers’ compensation losses are covered
by the program. All commercial property and casualty insurers licensed in the United States are
generally required to participate in the program. Under the program, a participating insurer, in
exchange for making terrorism insurance available, is entitled to be reimbursed by the Federal
Government for 82% of subject losses in 2018, after an insurer deductible, subject to an annual cap.
This reimbursement percentage will decrease over the remaining three-year life of the program to 80%
of subject losses by December 31, 2020.

The deductible for any calendar year is equal to 20% of the insurer’s direct earned premiums for
covered lines for the preceding calendar year. The Company’s estimated deductible under the program
is $2.46 billion for 2018. The annual cap limits the amount of aggregate subject losses for all
participating insurers to $100 billion. Once subject losses have reached the $100 billion aggregate
during a program year, participating insurers will not be liable under the program for additional
covered terrorism losses for that program year. There have been no terrorism-related losses that have
triggered program coverage since the program was established. Since the law is untested, there is
substantial uncertainty as to how it will be applied if an act of terrorism is certified under the program.
It is also possible that future legislative action could change or eliminate the program. Further, given
the unpredictable frequency and severity of terrorism losses, as well as the limited terrorism coverage in
the Company’s own reinsurance program, future losses from acts of terrorism, particularly involving
nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological events, could be material to the Company’s operating
results, financial position and/or liquidity in future periods. In addition, the Company may not have
sufficient resources to respond to claims arising from a high frequency of high severity natural
catastrophes and/or of man-made catastrophic events involving conventional means. While the
Company seeks to manage its exposure to man-made catastrophic events involving conventional means,
the Company may not have sufficient resources to respond to claims arising out of one or more
man-made catastrophic events involving nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological means.

(1) On August 4, 2017, the Company acquired Simply Business for strategic opportunities

related to the potential growth of the small commercial business market through
advancements in its product and underwriting technology, including a distribution model
that provides the capability to better assess and prepare for the demands of small
business owners who prefer to shop, purchase and service their insurance needs online.
At December 31, 2017, goodwill related to the acquisition of Simply Business was
$354 million. The total amount of goodwill expected to be deductible for tax purposes
related to Simply Business is $466 million, which includes certain acquisition costs and
intangible assets.

(1) Contract-based intangible assets subject to amortization are comprised of fair value

adjustments on claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, reinsurance recoverables
and other contract-related intangible assets. Customer-related intangible assets were not
material as of December 31, 2016. Fair value adjustments recorded in connection with
insurance acquisitions were based on management’s estimate of nominal claims and claim
adjustment expense reserves and reinsurance recoverables. The method used calculated a
risk adjustment to a risk-free discounted reserve that would, if reserves ran off as
expected, produce results that yielded the assumed cost-of-capital on the capital
supporting the loss reserves. The fair value adjustments are reported as other intangible
assets on the consolidated balance sheet, and the amounts measured in accordance with
the acquirer’s accounting policies for insurance contracts have been reported as part of
the claims and claim adjustment expense reserves and reinsurance recoverables. The
intangible assets are being recognized into income over the expected payment pattern.
Because the time value of money and the risk adjustment (cost of capital) components of
the intangible assets run off at different rates, the amount recognized in income may be a
net benefit in some periods and a net expense in other periods.

Amortization expense of intangible assets was $13 million, $11 million and $26 million for the

years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Intangible asset amortization expense is
estimated to be $15 million in 2018, $14 million in 2019, $13 million in 2020, $12 million in 2021 and
$11 million in 2022.

(1) Amount represents acquired net claims and claim adjustment expense reserves of Travelers

Participa¸c˜oes em Seguros Brasil S.A. at October 1, 2015.
Gross claims and claim adjustment expense reserves at December 31, 2017 increased by

$1.70 billion over December 31, 2016, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) catastrophe losses in the
second half of 2017 and (ii) higher volumes of insured exposures and loss cost trends for the current
accident year, partially offset by the impacts of (iii) payments related to operations in runoff and
(iv) net favorable prior year reserve development. Gross claims and claim adjustment expense reserves
at December 31, 2016 decreased by $343 million from December 31, 2015, primarily reflecting the
impacts of (i) payments related to operations in runoff, including the Company’s $524 million payment
related to the settlement of the PPG Industries, Inc. litigation and (ii) net favorable prior year reserve
development, partially offset by the impact of (iii) higher volumes of insured exposures and loss cost
trends for the current accident year.

Reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses at December 31, 2017 increased by $142 million over

December 31, 2016, primarily reflecting the impacts of catastrophe losses and the asbestos reserve
increase in the second half of 2017, partially offset by cash collections in 2017, including the settlement
of certain disputes as discussed in more detail in note 16. Reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses at
December 31, 2016 decreased by $468 million from December 31, 2015, primarily reflecting the impact
of cash collections in 2016, including the settlement of a reinsurance dispute which is discussed in more
detail in note 16.

7. INSURANCE CLAIM RESERVES (Continued)

Included in the claims and claim adjustment expense reserves are reserves for long-term disability

and annuity claim payments, primarily arising from workers’ compensation insurance and workers’
compensation excess insurance policies, that are discounted to the present value of the estimated future
payments. The discount rate used was 5% at both December 31, 2017 and 2016. Total reserves net of
the discount were $2.32 billion and $2.17 billion, and the related amount of discount was $1.10 billion
and $1.08 billion, at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Accretion of the discount is reported as
part of ‘‘claims and claim adjustment expenses’’ in the consolidated statements of income and was
$50 million, $50 million and $51 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Prior Year Reserve Development

The following disclosures regarding reserve development are on a ‘‘net of reinsurance’’ basis.

2017

In 2017, estimated claims and claim adjustment expenses incurred included $458 million of net
favorable development for claims arising in prior years, including $592 million of net favorable prior
year reserve development and $50 million of accretion of discount that impacted the Company’s results
of operations.

Business Insurance. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2017 totaled $439 million,

primarily driven by net favorable prior year reserve development in the segment’s domestic operations
due to better than expected loss experience in (i) the workers’ compensation product line for multiple
accident years, (ii) the general liability product line (excluding an increase to asbestos and
environmental reserves) for both primary and excess coverages for multiple accident years and (iii) the
commercial multi-peril product line for liability coverages for multiple accident years, partially offset by
(iv) a $225 million increase to asbestos reserves, (v) the impact of higher than expected loss experience
in the commercial automobile product line for recent accident years and (vi) a $65 million increase to
environmental reserves. The net favorable prior year reserve development in the segment’s domestic
operations was partially offset by net unfavorable prior year reserve development in the segment’s
international operations in Europe primarily due to the U.K. Ministry of Justice’s ‘‘Ogden’’ discount
rate adjustment applied to lump sum bodily injury payouts.

Bond & Specialty Insurance. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2017 totaled
$140 million, primarily driven by better than expected loss experience in the segment’s domestic
operations in the general liability product line for multiple accident years.

Personal Insurance. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2017 was not significant and

totaled $13 million.

2016

In 2016, estimated claims and claim adjustment expenses incurred included $680 million of net
favorable development for claims arising in prior years, including $771 million of net favorable prior
year reserve development and $50 million of accretion of discount that impacted the Company’s results
of operations.

7. INSURANCE CLAIM RESERVES (Continued)

Business Insurance. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2016 totaled $424 million,

primarily driven by better than expected loss experience in the Company’s domestic operations in
(i) the workers’ compensation product line for multiple accident years and (ii) the general liability
product line (excluding an increase to asbestos and environmental reserves), related to both primary
and excess coverages for multiple accident years, partially offset by (iii) a $225 million increase to
asbestos reserves and (iv) an $82 million increase to environmental reserves, as well as net favorable
prior year reserve development in the segment’s international operations in Europe.

Bond & Specialty Insurance. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2016 totaled

$350 million, primarily driven by better than expected loss experience in the Company’s domestic
operations in (i) the fidelity and surety product line for multiple accident years and (ii) the general
liability product line for multiple accident years.

Personal Insurance. Net unfavorable prior year reserve development in 2016 was not significant

and totaled $3 million.

2015

In 2015, estimated claims and claim adjustment expenses incurred included $817 million of net
favorable development for claims arising in prior years, including $941 million of net favorable prior
year reserve development and $51 million of accretion of discount that impacted the Company’s results
of operations.

Business Insurance. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2015 totaled $332 million,

primarily driven by better than expected loss experience in the Company’s domestic operations in
(i) the general liability product line (excluding increases to asbestos and environmental reserves), for
both primary and excess coverages for multiple accident years, (ii) the workers’ compensation line of
business for accident years 2006 and prior, (iii) the property product line related to catastrophe losses
for recent accident years and non-catastrophe losses for recent accident years, partially offset by (iv) a
$224 million increase to asbestos reserves and (v) a $72 million increase to environmental reserves, as
well as net favorable prior year reserve development in the Company’s operations at Lloyd’s.

Bond & Specialty Insurance. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2015 totaled

$281 million, primarily driven by better than expected loss experience in the Company’s domestic
operations in the fidelity and surety product line for multiple accident years, which was partially driven
by a reduction in outstanding exposures related to the financial crisis that commenced in 2007.

Personal Insurance. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2015 totaled $328 million,

primarily driven by better than expected loss experience in the Company’s domestic operations in
(i) the Homeowners and Other product line for liability coverages for recent accident years, for
non-catastrophe weather-related losses and non-weather-related losses for accident year 2014 and
(ii) the Automobile product line for liability coverages for recent accident years, as well as in the
Company’s international operations in Canada.

The claim development tables that follow present, by accident year, incurred and cumulative paid

claims and allocated claim adjustment expense on a historical basis. This claim development
information is presented on an undiscounted, net of reinsurance basis for ten years, or the number of
years for which claims incurred typically remain outstanding if less than ten years. The claim
development tables also provide the historical average annual percentage payout of incurred claims by
age, net of reinsurance, as supplementary information (identified as unaudited in the tables below). For
Personal Insurance—International—Canada, the claim development information reflects the acquisition
of The Dominion of Canada General Insurance Company (Dominion) in November 2013 on a

7. INSURANCE CLAIM RESERVES (Continued)

Methodology for Estimating Incurred But Not Reported (IBNR) Reserves

Claims and claim adjustment expense reserves represent management’s estimate of the ultimate
liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for claims that have been reported and claims
that have been incurred but not yet reported as of the balance sheet date. Claims and claim adjustment
expense reserves do not represent an exact calculation of the liability, but instead represent
management estimates, primarily utilizing actuarial expertise and projection methods that develop
estimates for the ultimate cost of claims and claim adjustment expenses. Because the establishment of
claims and claims adjustment expense reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates
and judgment, currently estimated claims and claim adjustment expense reserves may change. The
Company reflects changes to the reserves in the results of operations in the period the estimates are
changed.

Cumulative amounts paid and case reserves held as of the balance sheet date are subtracted from

the estimate of the ultimate cost of claims and claim adjustment expenses to derive incurred but not
reported (IBNR) reserves. Accordingly, IBNR reserves include the cost of unreported claims,
development on known claims and re-opened claims. This approach to estimating IBNR reserves has
been in place for many years, with no material changes in methodology in the past year.

Detailed claim data is typically insufficient to produce a reliable indication of the initial estimate

for ultimate claims and claim adjustment expenses for an accident year. As a result, the initial estimate
for an accident year is generally based on an exposure-based method using either the loss ratio
projection or the expected loss method. The loss ratio projection method, which is typically used for
guaranteed-cost business, develops an initial estimate of ultimate claims and claim adjustment expenses
for an accident year by multiplying earned premium for the accident year by a projected loss ratio. The
projected loss ratio is determined by analyzing prior period experience, and adjusting for loss cost
trends, rate level differences, mix of business changes and other known or observed factors influencing
the accident year relative to prior accident years. The expected loss method, which is typically used for
loss sensitive business, develops an initial estimate of ultimate claims and claim adjustment expenses for
an accident year by analyzing exposures by account.

For prior accident years, the following estimation and analysis methods are principally used by the

Company’s actuaries to estimate the ultimate cost of claims and claim adjustment expenses. These
estimation and analysis methods are typically referred to as conventional actuarial methods.

(cid:127) The paid loss development method assumes that the future change (positive or negative) in
cumulative paid losses for a given cohort of claims will occur in a stable, predictable pattern
from year-to-year, consistent with the pattern observed in past cohorts.

(cid:127) The case incurred development method is the same as the paid loss development method but is

based on cumulative case-incurred losses rather than paid losses.

(cid:127) The Bornhuetter-Ferguson method uses an initial estimate of ultimate losses for a given product
line reserve component, typically expressed as a ratio to earned premium. The method assumes
that the ratio of additional claim activity to earned premium for that component is relatively
stable and predictable over time and that actual claim activity to date is not a credible predictor
of further activity for that component. The method is used most often for more recent accident
years where claim data is sparse and/or volatile, with a transition to other methods as the
underlying claim data becomes more voluminous and therefore more credible.

(cid:127) The average value analysis combined with the reported claim development method assumes that
average claim values are stable and predictable over time for a particular cohort of claims. It is
typically limited to analysis at more granular levels, such as coverage or hazard/peril, where a
more homogeneous subset of claims produce a more stable and fairly predictable average value.
The reported claim development method is the same as the paid loss development method but
uses changes in cumulative claim counts to produce estimates of ultimate claim counts rather
than ultimate dollars. The resulting estimate of ultimate claim counts by cohort is multiplied by
an average value per claim from an average value analysis to obtain estimated ultimate claims
and claim adjustment expenses.

While these are the principal methods utilized, the Company’s actuaries have available to them the
full range of actuarial methods developed by the casualty actuarial profession. The Company’s actuaries
are also continually monitoring developments within the profession for advances in existing techniques
or the creation of new techniques that might improve current and future estimates. Most actuarial
methods assume that past patterns demonstrated in the data will repeat themselves in the future. For
certain reserve components where this assumption may not hold, such as asbestos and environmental
reserves, conventional actuarial methods are not utilized by the Company.

Methodology for Determining Cumulative Number of Reported Claims

A claim file is created when the Company is notified of an actual demand for payment, notified of
an event that may lead to a demand for payment or when it is determined that a demand for payment
could possibly lead to a future demand for payment on another coverage on the same policy or on
another policy. Claim files are generally created for a policy at the claimant by coverage level,
depending on the particular facts and circumstances of the underlying event.

For Business Insurance and for Personal Insurance, claim file information is summarized such that
the Company generally recognizes one count for each policy claim event by internal regulatory line of
business, regardless of the number of claimants or coverages involved. The claims counts are then
accumulated and reported by product line. While the methodology is generally consistent within each
segment for the product lines displayed, there are some minor differences between and within
segments. For Bond & Specialty Insurance, the Company recognizes one count per coverage per policy
claim event.

For purposes of the claims development tables above, claims reported for direct business are

counted even if they eventually close with no loss payment, except in the case of (i) deductible
business, where the claim is not counted until the case incurred claim estimate is above the deductible,
and (ii) International-Canada reported claim counts where claims closed with no loss payment are not
counted. Note that claims with zero claim dollars may still generate some level of claim adjustment
expenses. Claim counts for assumed business are included only to the extent such counts are available.
The Company generally does not receive claim count information for which the underlying claim
activity is handled by others, including pools and associations. The Company does not generate claim
counts for ceded business. The methods used to summarize claim counts have not changed significantly
over the time periods reported in the tables above.

The Company cautions against using the summarized claim count information provided in this

disclosure in attempting to project ultimate loss payouts by product line. The Company generally finds
claim count data to be useful only on a more granular basis than the aggregated basis disclosed in the

217

claim development tables above, as the risks, average values and other dynamics of the claim process
can vary materially by the cause of loss and coverage within product line. For example, in Personal
Automobile, the introduction of a new roadside assistance coverage feature several years ago resulted
in a significant increase in claim counts with a low average claim cost. For this reason the Company
varies its approach to, and in many cases the level of aggregation for, counting claims for internal
analysis purposes depending on the particular granular analysis performed.

Asbestos and Environmental Reserves

At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company’s claims and claim adjustment expense reserves

included $1.64 billion and $1.71 billion, respectively, for asbestos and environmental-related claims, net
of reinsurance.

It is difficult to estimate the reserves for asbestos and environmental-related claims due to the

vagaries of court coverage decisions, plaintiffs’ expanded theories of liability, the risks inherent in
complex litigation and other uncertainties, including, without limitation, those which are set forth
below.

Asbestos Reserves. Because each policyholder presents different liability and coverage issues, the
Company generally reviews the exposure presented by each policyholder at least annually. Among the
factors which the Company may consider in the course of this review are: available insurance coverage,
including the role of any umbrella or excess insurance the Company has issued to the policyholder;
limits and deductibles; an analysis of the policyholder’s potential liability; the jurisdictions involved; past
and anticipated future claim activity and loss development on pending claims; past settlement values of
similar claims; allocated claim adjustment expense; potential role of other insurance; the role, if any, of
non-asbestos claims or potential non-asbestos claims in any resolution process; and applicable coverage
defenses or determinations, if any, including the determination as to whether or not an asbestos claim
is a products/completed operation claim subject to an aggregate limit and the available coverage, if any,
for that claim.

In the third quarter of 2017, the Company completed its annual in-depth asbestos claim review,

including a review of active policyholders and litigation cases for potential product and ‘‘non-product’’
liability, and noted the continuation of the following trends:

(cid:127) a high level of litigation activity in certain jurisdictions involving individuals alleging serious

asbestos-related illness, primarily involving mesothelioma claims;

(cid:127) while overall payment patterns have been generally stable, there has been an increase in severity

for certain policyholders due to a high level of litigation activity; and

(cid:127) a moderate level of asbestos-related bankruptcy activity.
In the Home Office and Field Office category, which accounts for the vast majority of

policyholders with active asbestos-related claims, the number of policyholders tendering asbestos claims
for the first time and the number of policyholders with open asbestos claims declined slightly when
compared to 2016 while gross asbestos-related payments were higher. Payments on behalf of
policyholders in this category continue to be influenced by a high level of litigation activity in a limited
number of jurisdictions where individuals alleging serious asbestos-related injury, primarily

218

THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

7. INSURANCE CLAIM RESERVES (Continued)
mesothelioma, continue to target defendants who were not traditionally primary targets of asbestos
litigation.

The Company’s quarterly asbestos reserve reviews include an analysis of exposure and claim

payment patterns by policyholder category, as well as recent settlements, policyholder bankruptcies,
judicial rulings and legislative actions. The Company also analyzes developing payment patterns among
policyholders in the Home Office and Field Office, and Assumed Reinsurance and Other categories as
well as projected reinsurance billings and recoveries. In addition, the Company reviews its historical
gross and net loss and expense paid experience, year-by-year, to assess any emerging trends,
fluctuations, or characteristics suggested by the aggregate paid activity. Conventional actuarial methods
are not utilized to establish asbestos reserves and the Company’s evaluations have not resulted in a
reliable method to determine a meaningful average asbestos defense or indemnity payment.

The completion of these reviews and analyses in 2017, 2016 and 2015 resulted in $225 million,

$225 million and $224 million increases, respectively, in the Company’s net asbestos reserves. In each
year, the reserve increases were primarily driven by increases in the Company’s estimate of projected
settlement and defense costs related to a broad number of policyholders in the Home Office category
due to a higher than previously anticipated level of litigation activity surrounding mesothelioma claims.
This increase in the estimate of projected settlement and defense costs resulted from payment trends
that continue to be higher than previously anticipated due to the impact of the current litigation
environment discussed above. Over the past decade, the property and casualty insurance industry,
including the Company, has experienced net unfavorable prior year reserve development with regard to
asbestos reserves, but the Company believes that over that period there has been a reduction in the
volatility associated with the Company’s overall asbestos exposure as the overall asbestos environment
has evolved from one dominated by exposure to significant litigation risks, particularly coverage
disputes relating to policyholders in bankruptcy who were asserting that their claims were not subject to
the aggregate limits contained in their policies, to an environment primarily driven by a frequency of
litigation related to individuals with mesothelioma. The Company’s overall view of the current
underlying asbestos environment is essentially unchanged from recent periods and there remains a high
degree of uncertainty with respect to future exposure to asbestos claims.

Net asbestos paid loss and loss expenses in 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $271 million, $708 million

and $770 million, respectively. Net payments in 2016 included the $458 million net payment related to
PPG Industries, Inc. Net payments in 2015 included the $502 million payment related to the settlement
of asbestos direct action litigation. Approximately 4%, 69% and 69% of total net paid losses in 2017,
2016 and 2015, respectively, related to policyholders with whom the Company had entered into
settlement agreements limiting the Company’s liability.

Environmental Reserves.

In establishing environmental reserves, the Company evaluates the

exposure presented by each policyholder and the anticipated cost of resolution, if any. In the course of
this analysis, the Company generally considers the probable liability, available coverage and relevant
judicial interpretations. In addition, the Company considers the many variables presented, such as: the
nature of the alleged activities of the policyholder at each site; the number of sites; the total number of
potentially responsible parties at each site; the nature of the alleged environmental harm and the
corresponding remedy at each site; the nature of government enforcement activities at each site; the
ownership and general use of each site; the overall nature of the insurance relationship between the
Company and the policyholder, including the role of any umbrella or excess insurance the Company

219

THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

7. INSURANCE CLAIM RESERVES (Continued)
has issued to the policyholder; the involvement of other insurers; the potential for other available
coverage, including the number of years of coverage; the role, if any, of non-environmental claims or
potential non-environmental claims in any resolution process; and the applicable law in each
jurisdiction. The evaluation of the exposure presented by a policyholder can change as information
concerning that policyholder and the many variables presented is developed. Conventional actuarial
methods are not used to estimate these reserves.

The Company continues to receive notices from policyholders tendering claims for the first time,

frequently under policies issued prior to the mid-1980s. These policyholders continue to present smaller
exposures, have fewer sites and are lower tier defendants. Further, in many instances, clean-up costs
have been reduced because regulatory agencies are willing to accept risk-based site analyses and more
efficient clean-up technologies. Over the past several years, the Company has experienced generally
favorable trends in the number of new policyholders tendering environmental claims for the first time
and in the number of pending declaratory judgment actions relating to environmental matters.
However, the degree to which those favorable trends have continued has been less than anticipated. In
addition, reserve development on existing environmental claims has been greater than anticipated,
driven by claims and legal developments in a limited number of jurisdictions. As a result of these
factors, in 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company increased its net environmental reserves by $65 million,
$82 million and $72 million, respectively.

Asbestos and Environmental Reserves. As a result of the processes and procedures discussed
above, management believes that the reserves carried for asbestos and environmental claims are
appropriately established based upon known facts, current law and management’s judgment. However,
the uncertainties surrounding the final resolution of these claims continue, and it is difficult to
determine the ultimate exposure for asbestos and environmental claims and related litigation. As a
result, these reserves are subject to revision as new information becomes available and as claims
develop. The continuing uncertainties include, without limitation, the risks and lack of predictability
inherent in complex litigation, any impact from the bankruptcy protection sought by various asbestos
producers and other asbestos defendants, a further increase or decrease in the cost to resolve, and/or
the number of, asbestos and environmental claims beyond that which is anticipated, the emergence of a
greater number of asbestos claims than anticipated as a result of extended life expectancies resulting
from medical advances and lifestyle improvements, the role of any umbrella or excess policies the
Company has issued, the resolution or adjudication of disputes pertaining to the amount of available
coverage for asbestos and environmental claims in a manner inconsistent with the Company’s previous
assessment of these claims, the number and outcome of direct actions against the Company, future
developments pertaining to the Company’s ability to recover reinsurance for asbestos and
environmental claims and the unavailability of other insurance sources potentially available to
policyholders, whether through exhaustion of policy limits or through the insolvency of other
participating insurers. In addition, uncertainties arise from the insolvency or bankruptcy of
policyholders and other defendants. It is also not possible to predict changes in the legal, regulatory
and legislative environment and their impact on the future development of asbestos and environmental
claims. This environment could be affected by changes in applicable legislation and future court and
regulatory decisions and interpretations, including the outcome of legal challenges to legislative and/or
judicial reforms establishing medical criteria for the pursuit of asbestos claims. It is also difficult to
predict the ultimate outcome of complex coverage disputes until settlement negotiations near
completion and significant legal questions are resolved or, failing settlement, until the dispute is

220

THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

7. INSURANCE CLAIM RESERVES (Continued)
adjudicated. This is particularly the case with policyholders in bankruptcy where negotiations often
involve a large number of claimants and other parties and require court approval to be effective. As
part of its continuing analysis of asbestos and environmental reserves, the Company continues to study
the implications of these and other developments.

Because of the uncertainties set forth above, additional liabilities may arise for amounts in excess

of the Company’s current reserves. In addition, the Company’s estimate of claims and claim adjustment
expenses may change. These additional liabilities or increases in estimates, or a range of either, cannot
now be reasonably estimated and could result in income statement charges that could be material to
the Company’s operating results in future periods.

Catastrophe Exposure

The Company has geographic exposure to catastrophe losses, which can be caused by a variety of

events, including, among others, hurricanes, tornadoes and other windstorms, earthquakes, hail,
wildfires, severe winter weather, floods, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions and other naturally-occurring
events, such as solar flares. Catastrophes can also result from terrorist attacks and other intentionally
destructive acts including those involving nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological events, cyber
events, explosions and destruction of infrastructure. The incidence and severity of catastrophes are
inherently unpredictable. The extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount
of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event. Most catastrophes
are restricted to small geographic areas; however, hurricanes and earthquakes may produce significant
damage in larger areas, especially those that are heavily populated. The Company generally seeks to
mitigate its exposure to catastrophes through individual risk selection and the purchase of catastrophe
reinsurance.

There are also risks which impact the estimation of ultimate costs for catastrophes. For example,

the estimation of reserves related to hurricanes can be affected by the inability of the Company and its
insureds to access portions of the impacted areas, the complexity of factors contributing to the losses,
the legal and regulatory uncertainties and the nature of the information available to establish the
reserves. Complex factors include, but are not limited to: determining whether damage was caused by
flooding versus wind; evaluating general liability and pollution exposures; estimating additional living
expenses; the impact of demand surge; the potential impact of changing climate conditions, including
higher frequency and severity of weather-related events; infrastructure disruption; fraud; the effect of
mold damage and business income interruption costs; and reinsurance collectibility. The timing of a
catastrophe’s occurrence, such as at or near the end of a reporting period, can also affect the
information available to the Company in estimating reserves for that reporting period. The estimates
related to catastrophes are adjusted as actual claims emerge.

Description of Debt

Commercial Paper—The Company maintains an $800 million commercial paper program,
supported by a $1.0 billion bank credit agreement that expires on June 7, 2018. (See ‘‘Credit
Agreement’’ discussion that follows.) Interest rates on commercial paper issued in 2017 ranged from
0.65% to 1.17%, and in 2016 ranged from 0.35% to 0.55%.

Senior Notes—The Company’s various senior debt issues are unsecured obligations that rank
equally with one another. Interest payments are made semi-annually. The Company generally may
redeem some or all of the notes prior to maturity in accordance with terms unique to each debt
instrument.

Junior Subordinated Debentures—The Company’s three junior subordinated debenture instruments

are all similar in nature to each other. Three separate business trusts issued preferred securities to
investors and used the proceeds to purchase the Company’s junior subordinated debentures. Interest on
each of the instruments is paid semi-annually.

The Company’s consolidated balance sheet includes the debt instruments acquired in a business

acquisition, which were recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. The resulting fair value
adjustment is being amortized over the remaining life of the respective debt instruments using the
effective-interest method. The amortization of the fair value adjustment reduced interest expense by
$1 million and $2 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Credit Agreement

The Company is party to a five-year, $1.0 billion revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of

financial institutions that expires on June 7, 2018. Pursuant to the credit agreement covenants, the
Company must maintain a minimum consolidated net worth, defined as shareholders’ equity
determined in accordance with GAAP plus (a) trust preferred securities (not to exceed 15% of total
capital) and (b) mandatorily convertible securities (combined with trust preferred securities, not to
exceed 25% of total capital) less goodwill and other intangible assets, of $13.73 billion. In addition, the
credit agreement contains other customary restrictive covenants as well as certain customary events of
default, including with respect to a change in control, which is defined to include the acquisition of
35% or more of the Company’s voting stock and certain changes in the composition of the Company’s
board of directors. At December 31, 2017, the Company was in compliance with these covenants.
Generally, the cost of borrowing under this agreement will range from LIBOR plus 87.5 basis points to
LIBOR plus 150 basis points, depending on the Company’s credit ratings. At December 31, 2017, that
cost would have been LIBOR plus 112.5 basis points, had there been any amounts outstanding under
the credit agreement. This credit agreement also supports the Company’s commercial paper program.

Shelf Registration

The Company has a shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange

Commission that expires on June 17, 2019 which permits it to issue securities from time to time at
prices and on other terms to be determined at the time of offering.

Restricted Stock

In August 2017, the Company issued 95,953 shares of restricted stock valued at approximately

$12 million in connection with a business acquisition to certain employees of the acquired business. The
restricted stock is subject to service conditions and as such is recognized as share-based compensation;
50% of the restricted stock will vest two years from the issuance date and the remainder will vest three
years from the issuance date. The value will be recognized over the respective vesting periods and
included with the share-based compensation cost of awards that are issued under the Company’s share-
based incentive compensation plan (see note 13). The recipients generally have all the rights of a
shareholder of the Company including the right to vote the applicable shares of common stock and to
receive dividends on such shares, if and as declared by the Board of Directors. The restricted stock is
held under the Company’s control with the Company’s transfer agent and will be released upon vesting.

Treasury Stock

The Company’s Board of Directors has approved common share repurchase authorizations under

which repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market, pursuant to pre-set trading
plans meeting the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, in private
transactions or otherwise. The authorizations do not have a stated expiration date. The timing and
actual number of shares to be repurchased in the future will depend on a variety of factors, including
the Company’s financial position, earnings, share price, catastrophe losses, maintaining capital levels
commensurate with the Company’s desired ratings from independent rating agencies, funding of the
Company’s qualified pension plan, capital requirements of the Company’s operating subsidiaries, legal
requirements, regulatory constraints, other investment opportunities (including mergers and acquisitions
and related financings), market conditions and other factors. In April 2017, the Board of Directors
approved a share repurchase authorization that added an additional $5.0 billion of repurchase capacity.

$72 million, respectively, of its common stock under these plans.

9. SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY AND DIVIDEND AVAILABILITY (Continued)

Dividend Availability

The Company’s U.S. insurance subsidiaries, domiciled principally in the State of Connecticut, are
subject to various regulatory restrictions that limit the maximum amount of dividends available to be
paid by each insurance subsidiary to its respective parent company without prior approval of insurance
regulatory authorities. A maximum of $2.66 billion is available by the end of 2018 for such dividends to
the holding company, TRV, without prior approval of the Connecticut Insurance Department. The
Company may choose to accelerate the timing within 2018 and/or increase the amount of dividends
from its insurance subsidiaries in 2018, which could result in certain dividends being subject to approval
by the Connecticut Insurance Department.

In addition to the regulatory restrictions on the availability of dividends that can be paid by the

Company’s U.S. insurance subsidiaries, the maximum amount of dividends that may be paid to the
Company’s shareholders is limited, to a lesser degree, by certain covenants contained in its line of
credit agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions that require the Company to maintain a
minimum consolidated net worth as described in note 8.

TRV is not dependent on dividends or other forms of repatriation from its foreign operations to

support its liquidity needs. The undistributed earnings of the Company’s foreign operations are
intended to be permanently reinvested in those operations, and such earnings were not material to the
Company’s financial position or liquidity at December 31, 2017.

TRV and its two non-insurance holding company subsidiaries received dividends of $2.33 billion,

$3.05 billion and $3.75 billion from their U.S. insurance subsidiaries in 2017, 2016 and 2015,
respectively.

For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, TRV declared cash dividends per common

share of $2.83, $2.62 and $2.38, respectively, and paid cash dividends of $785 million, $757 million and
$739 million, respectively.

Statutory Net Income and Statutory Capital and Surplus

Statutory net income of the Company’s domestic and international insurance subsidiaries was

$2.30 billion, $3.20 billion and $3.80 billion for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. Statutory capital and surplus of the Company’s domestic and international insurance
subsidiaries was $20.45 billion and $20.76 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Basic earnings per share was computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders
by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The computation of
diluted earnings per share reflected the effect of potentially dilutive securities.

12. INCOME TAXES

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) which, among

other changes, reduced the U.S. federal tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning on January 1, 2018 and
imposed a tax on undistributed and previously untaxed post-1986 foreign earnings and profits
(accumulated foreign earnings). The estimated effects of enactment of TCJA are reflected in the net
deferred tax asset and current tax liability that are reported on the Company’s balance sheet at
December 31, 2017.

The Company paid income taxes of $514 million, $892 million and $1.21 billion during the years

ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The current income tax refundable of
$65 million at December 31, 2017 was included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet. The
current income tax payable of $72 million at December 31, 2016 was included in other liabilities in the
consolidated balance sheet.

In computing taxable income, property and casualty insurers reduce underwriting income by claims
and claim adjustment expenses incurred. The deduction for claims incurred is discounted at the interest
rates and for the claim payment patterns prescribed by the U.S. Treasury. TCJA changes the prescribed
interest rates to rates based on corporate bond yield curves and extends the applicable time periods for
the claim payment pattern. These changes are effective for tax years beginning after 2017 and are
subject to a transition rule that spreads the additional tax payment from the amount determined by
applying these changes over the subsequent eight years beginning in 2018. This item is a taxable
temporary difference and has no direct impact on total tax expense for 2017 and future years. The
required additional tax payments are currently estimated to approximate $70 million per year over the
eight-year period and will result in a modest reduction in net investment income. The Company’s tax
payments will reflect the amounts due under the transition rule beginning in 2018.

If the Company determines that any of its deferred tax assets will not result in future tax benefits,

a valuation allowance must be established for the portion of these assets that are not expected to be
realized. The net change in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was an increase of
$3 million in 2017 relating to the Company’s consolidated Brazilian subsidiary. Based upon a review of
the Company’s anticipated future taxable income, and also including all other available evidence, both
positive and negative, the Company’s management concluded that it is more likely than not that the net
deferred tax assets will be realized.

For tax return purposes, as of December 31, 2017, the Company had net operating loss (NOL)
carryforwards in Brazil and the United Kingdom. The amount and timing of realizing the benefits of
NOL carryforwards depend on future taxable income and limitations imposed by tax laws. Only the
benefits of the United Kingdom NOL carryforwards have been recognized in the consolidated financial
statements and are included in net deferred tax assets. The NOL amounts by jurisdiction and year of
expiration are as follows:

December 2017. These undistributed foreign earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested in
those operations.

The Company has recorded provisional amounts for the tax imposed on accumulated foreign

earnings and partnership investments, as well as the amount due under the transition rule relating to
the change in discounting of claims incurred, based on information available at December 31, 2017. As
a result of the Company’s normal U.S. income tax return preparation process, the Company expects
taxes related to accumulated foreign earnings and partnerships to be adjusted as final earnings from
foreign operations and partnership investments (Form K-1’s) are received in 2018 for preparation of the
Company’s 2017 U.S. income tax return that will be filed in 2018. The amounts payable under the
transition rules related to discounting have been estimated but are subject to change once the U.S.
Treasury issues guidance sometime in 2018. Adjustments to temporary differences will result from the
reduced income tax rate applied to the deferred taxes associated with these items. Provisional amounts
may also be adjusted to the extent future clarifications of TCJA are provided.

The following is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits

for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:

Included in the balances at December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $3 million and $7 million,

respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the annual effective tax rate.
Also included in the balances at those dates were $3 million and $6 million, respectively, of tax
positions for which the ultimate deductibility is certain, but for which there is uncertainty about the
timing of deductibility. The timing of such deductibility could affect the annual effective tax rate
depending on the year of deduction and tax rate at the time.

The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax

benefits in income taxes. During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company
recognized approximately $(33) million, $31 million and $(32) million in interest, respectively. The
Company had approximately $25 million and $57 million accrued for the payment of interest at
December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

The IRS has completed examinations of the Company’s U.S. income tax returns for all years

through 2014. The Company does not expect any significant changes to its liability for unrecognized tax
benefits during the next twelve months.

13. SHARE-BASED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION

The Company has a share-based incentive compensation plan, The Travelers Companies, Inc.

Amended and Restated 2014 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2014 Incentive Plan), the purposes of which are
to align the interests of the Company’s non-employee directors, executive officers and other employees
with those of the Company’s shareholders and to attract and retain personnel by providing incentives in
the form of share-based awards. The 2014 Incentive Plan permits grants of nonqualified stock options,
incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, deferred stock,
deferred stock units, performance awards and other share-based or share-denominated awards with
respect to the Company’s common stock. The Company has a policy of issuing new shares to settle the
exercise of stock option awards and the vesting of other equity awards.

In connection with the adoption of the 2014 Incentive Plan, The Travelers Companies, Inc.

Amended and Restated 2004 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended (the 2004 Incentive Plan) was
terminated, joining several other legacy share-based incentive compensation plans that had been
terminated in prior years (together, the legacy plans). Outstanding grants were not affected by the
termination of the legacy plans. The 2014 Incentive Plan is currently the only plan pursuant to which
future stock-based awards may be granted.

The number of shares of the Company’s common stock initially authorized for grant under the

2014 Incentive Plan was 10 million shares. In May 2017 and 2016, the Company’s shareholders
authorized an additional 2.5 million and 4.4 million shares of the Company’s common stock,
respectively, for grant under the 2014 Incentive Plan. The following are not counted towards the
combined 16.9 million shares available and will be available for future grants under the 2014 Incentive
Plan: (i) shares of common stock subject to awards that expire unexercised, that are forfeited,
terminated or canceled, that are settled in cash or other forms of property, or otherwise do not result
in the issuance of shares of common stock, in whole or in part; (ii) shares that are used to pay the
exercise price of stock options and shares used to pay withholding taxes on awards generally; and
(iii) shares purchased by the Company on the open market using cash option exercise proceeds;
provided, however, that the increase in the number of shares of common stock available for grant
pursuant to such market purchases shall not be greater than the number that could be repurchased at
fair market value on the date of exercise of the stock option giving rise to such option proceeds. In
addition, the 16.9 million shares authorized by shareholders for issuance under the 2014 Incentive Plan
will be increased by any shares subject to awards under the 2004 Incentive Plan that were outstanding
as of May 27, 2014 and subsequently expire, are forfeited, canceled, settled in cash or otherwise
terminate without the issuance of shares.

The Company also has a compensation program for non-employee directors (the Director
Compensation Program). Under the Director Compensation Program, non-employee directors’
compensation consists of an annual retainer, a deferred stock award, committee chair fees and a lead
director fee. Each non-employee director may choose to receive all or a portion of his or her annual
retainer in the form of cash or deferred stock units which vest upon grant. The annual deferred stock
awards vest in full one day prior to the date of the Company’s annual meeting of shareholders
occurring in the year following the year of the grant date, subject to continued service. The deferred
stock awards, including dividend equivalents, accumulate until distribution either in a lump sum six
months after termination of service as a director or, if the director so elects, in annual installments
beginning at least six months following termination of service as a director. The deferred stock units
issued under the Director Compensation Program are awarded under the 2014 Incentive Plan.

Stock Option Awards

Stock option awards granted to eligible officers and key employees have a ten-year term. All stock

options are granted with an exercise price equal to the closing price of the Company’s common stock
on the date of grant. The stock options granted generally vest upon meeting certain years of service
criteria. Except as the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors may allow in the future,
stock options cannot be sold or transferred by the participant. Stock options outstanding under the
2014 Incentive Plan and the 2004 Incentive Plan generally vest three years after grant date (cliff vest).
The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant by application of a variation

of the Black-Scholes option pricing model using the assumptions noted in the following table. The
expected term of newly granted stock options is the time to vest plus half the remaining time to
expiration. This considers the vesting restriction and represents an even pattern of exercise behavior
over the remaining term. The expected volatility assumption is based on the historical volatility of the
Company’s common stock for the same period as the estimated option term generally using the
volatility of the week prior to the stock option grant. The expected dividend is based upon the
Company’s current quarter dividend annualized and assumed to be constant over the expected option
term. The risk-free interest rate for each option is the interpolated market yield of a U.S. Treasury bill
with a term comparable to the expected option term for the same week used for measuring volatility.
The following table provides information about options granted:

On February 6, 2018, the Company, under the 2014 Incentive Plan, granted 1,632,361 stock option

awards with an exercise price of $140.85 per share. The fair value attributable to the stock option
awards on the date of grant was $20.13 per share.

Restricted Stock Units, Deferred Stock Units and Performance Share Award Programs

The Company issues restricted stock unit awards to eligible officers and key employees under the

Equity Awards program established pursuant to the 2014 Incentive Plan. A restricted stock unit
represents the right to receive a share of common stock. These restricted stock unit awards are granted
at market price, generally vest three years from the date of grant, do not have voting rights and the
underlying shares of common stock are not issued until the vesting criteria is satisfied. In addition, the
Company’s board of directors can be issued deferred stock units from (i) an annual award; (ii) deferred
compensation (in lieu of cash retainer); and (iii) dividend equivalents earned on outstanding deferred
compensation.

The Company also has a Performance Share Awards Program established pursuant to the 2004

Incentive Plan and which continues pursuant to the 2014 Incentive Plan. Under the program, the
Company may issue performance share awards to certain employees of the Company who hold
positions of Vice President (or its equivalent) or above. The performance share awards provide the
recipient the right to earn shares of the Company’s common stock based upon the Company’s
attainment of certain performance goals and the recipient meeting certain years of service criteria. The
performance goals for performance share awards are based on the Company’s adjusted return on equity
over a three-year performance period. Vesting of performance shares is contingent upon the Company
attaining the relevant performance period minimum threshold return on equity and the recipient
meeting certain years of service criteria, generally three years for full vesting, subject to proration for
certain termination conditions. If the performance period return on equity is below the minimum
threshold, none of the performance shares will vest. If performance meets or exceeds the minimum

238

13. SHARE-BASED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION (Continued)
performance threshold, a range of performance shares will vest (50% to 150% for awards granted in
2016, 2017 and 2018), depending on the actual return on equity attained.

The fair value of restricted stock units, deferred stock units and performance shares is measured at

the market price of the Company stock at date of grant. Under terms of the 2014 Incentive Plan,
holders of deferred stock units and performance shares may receive dividend equivalents.

The total fair value of shares that vested during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and

2015 was $166 million, $175 million and $179 million, respectively.

13. SHARE-BASED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION (Continued)

Share-Based Compensation Cost Recognition

The amount of compensation cost for awards subject to a service condition is based on the number

of shares expected to be issued and is recognized over the time period for which service is to be
provided (requisite service period). Awards granted to retiree-eligible employees or to employees who
become retiree-eligible before an award’s vesting date are considered to have met the requisite service
condition. The compensation cost for awards subject to a performance condition is based upon the
probable outcome of the performance condition, which on the grant date reflects an estimate of
attaining 100% of the performance shares granted. The compensation cost reflects an estimated annual
forfeiture rate from 3.0% to 4.0% over the requisite service period of the awards. That estimate is
revised if subsequent information indicates that the actual number of instruments expected to vest is
likely to differ from previous estimates. Compensation costs for awards are recognized on a
straight-line basis over the requisite service period. For awards that have graded vesting terms, the
compensation cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each
separate vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in substance, multiple awards. The total
compensation cost for all share-based incentive compensation awards recognized in earnings for the
years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $136 million, $155 million and $141 million,
respectively. Included in these amounts are compensation cost adjustments of $3 million, $11 million
and $8 million, for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, that reflected the
cost associated with the updated estimate of performance shares due to attaining certain performance
levels from the date of the initial grant of the performance awards. The related tax benefits recognized
in earnings were $45 million, $52 million and $47 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016
and 2015, respectively.

At December 31, 2017, there was $143 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to

all nonvested share-based incentive compensation awards. This includes stock options, restricted and
deferred stock units and performance shares granted under the 2014 Incentive Plan and the 2004
Incentive Plan and restricted common stock issued in connection with a 2017 business acquisition. The
unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of
1.8 years. Cash received from the exercise of employee stock options under share-based compensation
plans totaled $173 million and $332 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The tax benefit for tax
deductions from employee stock options exercised during 2017 and 2016 totaled $31 million and
$58 million, respectively.

14. PENSION PLANS, RETIREMENT BENEFITS AND SAVINGS PLANS

The Company sponsors a qualified non-contributory defined benefit pension plan (the qualified
domestic pension plan), which covers substantially all U.S. domestic employees and provides benefits
under a cash balance formula, except that certain limited groups of legacy participants are covered by a
prior traditional final average pay formula. In addition, the Company sponsors a nonqualified defined
benefit pension plan which covers certain highly-compensated employees, pension plans for employees
of its foreign subsidiaries, and a postretirement health and life insurance benefit plan for employees
satisfying certain age and service requirements and for certain retirees.

The total accumulated benefit obligation for the Company’s defined benefit pension plans was
$3.77 billion and $3.48 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The qualified domestic
pension plan accounted for $3.55 billion and $3.26 billion of the total accumulated benefit obligation at
December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, whereas the nonqualified and foreign plans accounted for
$0.22 billion of the total accumulated benefit obligation at both December 31, 2017 and 2016.

For pension plans with an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets, the aggregate
projected benefit obligation was $0.2 billion at both December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the aggregate
accumulated benefit obligation was $0.2 billion at both December 31, 2017 and 2016. The fair value of
plan assets for the above plans was $0.1 billion at both December 31, 2017 and 2016.

The Company has discretion regarding whether to provide additional funding and when to provide

such funding to its qualified domestic pension plan. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, there were no required
contributions to the qualified domestic pension plan. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company voluntarily
made contributions totaling $300 million, $200 million and $100 million, respectively, to the qualified
domestic pension plan. There is no required contribution to the qualified domestic pension plan during
2018, and the Company has not determined whether or not additional funding will be made during
2018. With respect to the Company’s foreign pension plans, there are no significant required
contributions in 2018.

In 2016, the Company began using a full yield-curve approach in the estimation of the service and

interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs for its qualified and nonqualified domestic
pension plans and its domestic postretirement benefit plans. The full yield-curve approach applies the
specific spot rates along the yield curve that the Company used to determine its projected benefit
obligation at the beginning of the year to the projected cash flows related to service and interest costs.
Previously, the Company estimated these service and interest cost components by applying a single
weighted-average discount rate derived from this yield curve. This change was made to provide a better
estimate of the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs, consistent with the
methodology used to estimate the projected benefit obligation for each of the benefit plans.

This change did not affect the measurement of the Company’s total benefit obligations as the

change in the service cost and interest cost is completely offset in the actuarial (gain) loss reported for
the period. The change reduced the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs
for 2016 by $6 million and $30 million, respectively, and resulted in an $0.08 increase in diluted net
income per share for 2016. The weighted average discount rates that were used to measure service and
interest costs during 2016 were 4.77% and 3.64%, respectively, for the domestic qualified pension plan,
4.53% and 3.47%, respectively, for the domestic nonqualified pension plan and 0.00% and 3.53%,
respectively, for the domestic postretirement benefit plan. The discount rate associated with the service
cost component of the domestic postretirement benefit plan is zero as it is a closed plan and all
participants are fully vested. Under the Company’s prior estimation approach, the weighted average
discount rate for both the service and interest cost components would have been 4.50% for the
domestic qualified pension plan, 4.37% for the domestic nonqualified pension plan and 4.35% for the
domestic postretirement benefit plan. The Company accounted for this change as a change in estimate,
and accordingly, recognized the effect prospectively beginning in 2016.

For the defined benefit pension plans, the estimated net actuarial loss that will be reclassified
(amortized) from accumulated other comprehensive income into net income as part of net periodic
benefit cost over the next fiscal year is $91 million and the estimated prior service benefit to be

244

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

14. PENSION PLANS, RETIREMENT BENEFITS AND SAVINGS PLANS (Continued)
amortized over the next fiscal year is $1 million. For the postretirement benefit plans, the estimated net
actuarial gain that will be reclassified (amortized) from accumulated other comprehensive income into
net income as part of net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year is less than $1 million, and the
estimated prior service benefit to be amortized over the next fiscal year is $4 million.

The discount rate assumption used to determine the benefit obligation is based on a yield-curve

approach. Under this approach, individual spot rates from the yield curve of a hypothetical portfolio of

245

THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

14. PENSION PLANS, RETIREMENT BENEFITS AND SAVINGS PLANS (Continued)
high quality fixed maturity corporate bonds (rated Aa) available at the year-end valuation date, for
which the timing and amount of cash outflows correspond with the timing and amount of the estimated
benefit payouts of the Company’s benefit plan, are applied to expected future benefits payments in
measuring the projected benefit obligation. The discount rate assumption used to determine benefit
obligations disclosed above represents the weighted average of the individual spot rates.

The discount rate assumption used to determine the net periodic benefit cost is the single weighted

average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the
beginning of the year.

In choosing the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the Company selected the rate

that was set as the return objective by the Company’s Benefit Plans Investment Committee, which had
considered the historical returns of equity and fixed maturity markets in conjunction with prevailing
economic and financial market conditions.

As an indicator of sensitivity, increasing the assumed health care cost trend rate by 1% would have
increased the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $22 million at December 31, 2017, and
the aggregate of the service and interest cost components of net postretirement benefit expense by
$1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Decreasing the assumed health care cost trend rate
by 1% would have decreased the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at December 31, 2017
by $19 million and the aggregate of the service and interest cost components of net postretirement
benefit expense by $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.

The assumptions made for the Company’s foreign pension and foreign postretirement benefit plans

are not materially different from those of the Company’s qualified domestic pension plan and the
domestic postretirement benefit plan.

Plan Assets

The qualified domestic pension plan assets are invested for the exclusive benefit of the plan

participants and beneficiaries and are intended, over time, to satisfy the benefit obligations under the
plan. Risk tolerance is established through consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded status and
corporate financial position. The asset mix guidelines have been established and are reviewed quarterly.
These guidelines are intended to serve as tools to facilitate the investment of plan assets to maximize
long-term total return and the ongoing oversight of the plan’s investment performance. Investment risk
is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through daily and monthly investment portfolio
reviews, annual liability measurements and periodic asset/liability studies.

The Company’s overall investment strategy for the qualified domestic pension plan is to achieve a
mix of approximately 85% to 90% of investments for long-term growth and 10% to 15% for near-term
benefit payments with a diversification of asset types, fund strategies and fund managers. The current
target allocations for plan assets are 55% to 65% equity securities and 20% to 40% fixed income
securities, with the remainder allocated to short-term securities. Equity securities primarily include
investments in large, medium and small-cap companies primarily located in the United States. Fixed
income securities include corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries, mortgage-backed
securities, U.S. Treasury securities and debt securities issued by foreign governments.

Assets of the Company’s foreign pension plans are not significant.

Fair Value Measurement—Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefit Assets

For a discussion of the methods employed by the Company to measure the fair value of invested

assets, see note 4. The following discussion of fair value measurements applies exclusively to the
Company’s pension plans and other postretirement benefit assets.

Fair value estimates for equity and bond mutual funds held by the pension plans reflect prices
received from an external pricing service that are based on observable market transactions. These
estimates are included in Level 1.

Short-term securities are carried at fair value which approximates cost plus accrued interest or

amortized discount. The fair value or market value of these is periodically compared to this amortized
cost and is based on significant observable inputs as determined by an external pricing service.
Accordingly, the estimates of fair value for such short-term securities, other than U.S. Treasury
securities and money market mutual funds, provided by an external pricing service are included in the
amount disclosed in Level 2 of the hierarchy. The estimated fair value of U.S. Treasury securities and
money market mutual funds is included in the amount disclosed in Level 1 as the estimates are based
on unadjusted market prices.

Fair Value Hierarchy—Pension Plans

Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

The Company’s overall investment strategy is to achieve a mix of approximately 35% to 65% of

investments for long-term growth and 35% to 60% for near-term insurance payments with a wide
diversification of asset types, fund strategies and fund managers. The current target allocations for plan
assets are 25% to 75% fixed income securities, with the remainder allocated to short-term securities.
Fixed income securities include corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries, mortgage-
backed securities and U.S. Treasuries.

Fair Value—Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

The Company’s other postretirement benefit plans had financial assets of $13 million and

$14 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which are measured at fair value on a
recurring basis. The assets are primarily corporate bonds and short-term securities and categorized as
level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

Savings Plan

The Company has a savings plan, The Travelers 401(k) Savings Plan (the Savings Plan), in which
substantially all U.S. domestic Company employees are eligible to participate. Under the Savings Plan,
the Company matches employee contributions up to 5% of eligible pay, with a maximum annual match
of $6,500 which becomes 100% vested after three years of service. The Company’s matching
contribution is made in cash and invested according to the employee’s current investment elections and
can be reinvested into other investment options in accordance with the terms of the plan. The
Company’s non-U.S. employees participate in separate savings plans. The total expense related to all of
the savings plans was $119 million, $114 million and $109 million for the years ended December 31,
2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

All common shares held by the Savings Plan are considered outstanding for basic and diluted EPS

computations and dividends paid on all shares are charged to retained earnings.

15. LEASES

Rent expense was $188 million, $197 million and $202 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Future minimum annual rental payments under noncancellable operating leases for 2018, 2019,

2020, 2021 and 2022 are $130 million, $108 million, $91 million, $75 million and $51 million,
respectively, and $103 million for 2023 and thereafter. Future sublease rental income aggregating
approximately $4 million will partially offset these commitments.

16. CONTINGENCIES, COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES

Contingencies

The major pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the

business, to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or to which any of the Company’s
properties is subject are described below.

16. CONTINGENCIES, COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES (Continued)

Asbestos and Environmental Claims and Litigation

In the ordinary course of its insurance business, the Company has received and continues to

receive claims for insurance arising under policies issued by the Company asserting alleged injuries and
damages from asbestos- and environmental-related exposures that are the subject of related coverage
litigation. The Company is defending asbestos- and environmental-related litigation vigorously and
believes that it has meritorious defenses; however, the outcomes of these disputes are uncertain. In this
regard, the Company employs dedicated specialists and comprehensive resolution strategies to manage
asbestos and environmental loss exposure, including settling litigation under appropriate circumstances.
Currently, it is not possible to predict legal outcomes and their impact on the future development of
claims and litigation relating to asbestos and environmental claims. Any such development will be
affected by future court decisions and interpretations, as well as changes in applicable legislation.
Because of these uncertainties, additional liabilities may arise for amounts in excess of the Company’s
current insurance reserves. In addition, the Company’s estimate of ultimate claims and claim
adjustment expenses may change. These additional liabilities or changes in estimates, or a range of
either, cannot now be reasonably estimated and could result in income statement charges that could be
material to the Company’s results of operations in future periods.

Other Proceedings Not Arising Under Insurance Contracts or Reinsurance Agreements

The Company is involved in other lawsuits, including lawsuits alleging extra-contractual damages
relating to insurance contracts or reinsurance agreements, that do not arise under insurance contracts
or reinsurance agreements. The legal costs associated with such lawsuits are expensed in the period in
which the costs are incurred. Based upon currently available information, the Company does not
believe it is reasonably possible that any such lawsuit or related lawsuits would be material to the
Company’s results of operations or would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial
position or liquidity.

Gain Contingency

On August 17, 2010, in a reinsurance dispute in New York state court captioned United States

Fidelity & Guaranty Company v. American Re-Insurance Company, et al., the trial court granted summary
judgment for United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company (USF&G), a subsidiary of the Company,
and denied summary judgment for the reinsurers. The Court of Appeals largely affirmed the entry of
summary judgment, but remanded two discrete issues for trial.

On November 7, 2016, the Company agreed to a settlement with one of the three defendants then

remaining in this dispute. The Company received payment under the settlement in the fourth quarter
of 2016 and, as a result, recognized a $126 million pre-tax ($82 million after-tax) gain in the fourth
quarter, which was included in ‘‘other revenues’’ in the consolidated statement of income for the year
ended December 31, 2016. In connection with that settlement, the reinsurance recoverable balance
related to this case was reduced from approximately $238 million to approximately $31 million in the
Company’s consolidated balance sheet. At March 31, 2017, the claim related to the remaining
defendants totaled $71 million, comprising the $31 million of reinsurance recoverable plus interest
amounting to $40 million as of that date. The interest was treated for accounting purposes as a gain
contingency in accordance with FASB Topic 450, Contingencies, and accordingly was not recognized in
the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

16. CONTINGENCIES, COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES (Continued)

On May 1, 2017, the Company agreed to a settlement of this dispute with the two remaining

defendants, along with the settlement of several other disputes with these same parties. As a result of
the settlement of all of these matters, the Company recorded an immaterial gain in ‘‘other revenues’’ in
its consolidated statement of income for the three months ended June 30, 2017, and the reinsurance
recoverable of $31 million in the Company’s balance sheet was fully satisfied.

Other Commitments and Guarantees

Commitments

Investment Commitments—The Company has unfunded commitments to private equity limited

partnerships and real estate partnerships in which it invests. These commitments totaled $1.56 billion
and $1.60 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Guarantees

In the ordinary course of selling businesses to third parties, the Company has agreed to indemnify

purchasers for losses arising out of breaches of representations and warranties with respect to the
businesses being sold, covenants and obligations of the Company and/or its subsidiaries and, in certain
cases, obligations arising from certain liabilities. Such indemnification provisions generally are
applicable from the closing date to the expiration of the relevant statutes of limitations, although, in
some cases, there may be agreed upon term limitations or no term limitations. Certain of these
contingent obligations are subject to deductibles which have to be incurred by the obligee before the
Company is obligated to make payments. The maximum amount of the Company’s contingent
obligation for indemnifications related to the sale of businesses that are quantifiable was $358 million
at December 31, 2017, of which $2 million was recognized on the balance sheet at that date.

The Company also has contingent obligations for guarantees related to certain investments, third-

party loans related to certain investments, certain insurance policy obligations of former insurance
subsidiaries and various other indemnifications. The Company also provides standard indemnifications
to service providers in the normal course of business. The indemnification clauses are often standard
contractual terms. The maximum amount of the Company’s obligation for guarantees of certain
investments and third-party loans related to certain investments that are quantifiable was $45 million at
December 31, 2017, approximately $23 million of which is indemnified by a third party. The maximum
amount of the Company’s obligation related to the guarantee of certain insurance policy obligations of
a former insurance subsidiary was $480 million at December 31, 2017, all of which is indemnified by a
third party.

Certain of the guarantees and indemnifications described above have no stated or notional

amounts or limitation to the maximum potential future payments, and, accordingly, the Company is
unable to provide an estimate of the maximum potential payments for such arrangements.

17. NONCASH INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES

There were no material noncash financing or investing activities during the years ended

December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.

18. CONSOLIDATING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND

SUBSIDIARIES
The following consolidating financial statements of the Company have been prepared pursuant to

Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X. These consolidating financial statements have been prepared from the
Company’s financial information on the same basis of accounting as the consolidated financial
statements. The Travelers Companies, Inc. (excluding its subsidiaries, TRV) has fully and
unconditionally guaranteed certain debt obligations of Travelers Property Casualty Corp. (TPC) and
Travelers Insurance Group Holdings, Inc. (TIGHI), which totaled $700 million at December 31, 2017.

Prior to the merger of TPC and The St. Paul Companies, Inc. in 2004, TPC fully and

unconditionally guaranteed the payment of all principal, premiums, if any, and interest on certain debt
obligations of its wholly-owned subsidiary, TIGHI. Concurrent with the merger, TRV fully and
unconditionally assumed such guarantee obligations of TPC. TPC is deemed to have no assets or
operations independent of TIGHI. Consolidating financial information for TIGHI has not been
presented herein because such financial information would be substantially the same as the financial
information provided for TPC.

(1) Income tax expense for the fourth quarter and full year of 2017 included a net charge of

$129 million to reflect the change in tax laws and tax rates enacted in the U.S. on December 22,
2017 as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, resulting primarily from revaluing the
Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities and the tax imposed on accumulated foreign earnings.
(2) Due to the use of an average number of shares for each quarter, the sum of the quarterly earnings

per share may not equal the total earnings per share for the full year.

Item 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND

FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

Not Applicable.

Item 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in

Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange
Act)) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company’s reports
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to
the Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as
appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Any controls and procedures, no
matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired
control objectives. The Company’s management, with the participation of the Company’s Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and
operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2017. Consistent
with guidance issued by the SEC that an assessment of internal controls over financial reporting of a
recently acquired business may be omitted from management’s evaluation of disclosure controls and
procedures, management is excluding an assessment of such internal controls for Simply Business from
its evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures. The Company
acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Simply Business Holdings Ltd (Simply Business) on
August 4, 2017. Simply Business represented less than 1% of the Company’s consolidated total assets,
consolidated total revenues and net income as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017. Based
upon that evaluation and subject to the foregoing, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2017, the design and operation of the Company’s
disclosure controls and procedures were effective to accomplish their objectives at the reasonable
assurance level.

In addition, there was no change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as

that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the
quarter ended December 31, 2017 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. The Company is in the process of
reviewing the internal control structure of Simply Business and, if necessary, will make appropriate
changes as it continues to integrate Simply Business into the Company’s overall internal control over
the financial reporting process.

The Company regularly seeks to identify, develop and implement improvements to its technology
systems and business processes, some of which may affect its internal control over financial reporting.
These changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, updating
existing systems or platforms, automating manual processes or utilizing technology developed by third
parties. These systems changes are often phased in over multiple periods in order to limit the
implementation risk in any one period, and as each change is implemented the Company monitors its
effectiveness as part of its internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal

control over financial reporting. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to
provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the
consolidated financial statements of the Company in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles. The Company’s accounting policies and internal controls over financial reporting,
established and maintained by management, are under the general oversight of the Company’s Audit
Committee.

The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures

that:

(cid:127) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the

transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;

(cid:127) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation

of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and
that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the
Company’s management and directors; and

(cid:127) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized

acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or

detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management has assessed the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2017. The standard measures adopted by management in making its evaluation are the
measures in the Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) published by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

Consistent with guidance issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission that an assessment of

a recently acquired business may be omitted from management’s report on internal control over
financial reporting in the year of acquisition, management excluded an assessment of the effectiveness
of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting related to Simply Business. The Company
acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Simply Business on August 4, 2017. Simply
Business represented less than 1% of the Company’s consolidated total assets, consolidated total
revenues and net income as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Based upon its assessment, management has concluded that the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting was effective at December 31, 2017, and that there were no material weaknesses in
the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of that date.

KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, which has audited and reported on

the consolidated financial statements contained in this Form 10-K, has issued its report on the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting which follows this report.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Shareholders and Board of Directors
The Travelers Companies, Inc.:

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited The Travelers Companies, Inc. and subsidiaries’ (the ‘‘Company’’) internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control—
Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United

States) (‘‘PCAOB’’), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the related consolidated
statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31, 2017, and the related notes and financial statement schedules as listed in the index to
consolidated financial statements and schedules (collectively, the ‘‘consolidated financial statements’’), and our report dated
February 15, 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

The Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Simply Business Holdings Ltd. (Simply Business) on

August 4, 2017. Management excluded Simply Business from its assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017. Simply Business represented less than 1% of the Company’s consolidated total
assets, consolidated total revenues and net income as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our audit of internal control
over financial reporting of the Company also excluded an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Simply
Business.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its

assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report
on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be
independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and

perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained
in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures
as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,

projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Item 9B. OTHER INFORMATION

Executive Ownership and Sales. All of the Company’s executive officers are subject to the

Company’s executive stock ownership policy. For a summary of this policy as currently in effect, see
‘‘Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Stock Ownership Guidelines, Anti-Hedging and Pledging
Policies, and Other Trading Restrictions’’ in the Company’s proxy statement filed with the SEC on
March 31, 2017. From time to time, some of the Company’s executives may determine that it is
advisable to diversify their investments for personal financial planning reasons, or may seek liquidity for
other reasons, and may, in compliance with the stock ownership policy, sell shares of common stock of
the Company on the open market, in private transactions or to the Company. To effect such sales, from
time to time, some of the Company’s executives may enter into trading plans designed to comply with
the Company’s Securities Trading Policy and the provisions of Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. The trading plans will not reduce any of the executives’ ownership of the
Company’s shares below the applicable executive stock ownership guidelines. The Company does not
undertake any obligation to report Rule 10b5-1 plans that may be adopted by any employee or director
of the Company in the future, or to report any modifications or termination of any publicly announced
plan.

As of the date of this report, Jay S. Benet, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, was the

only ‘‘named executive officer’’ (i.e. an executive officer named in the compensation disclosures in the
Company’s most recent proxy statement filed) that has entered into a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan that
remains in effect. Under the Company’s stock ownership guidelines, Mr. Benet has a target ownership
level established as the lesser of 30,000 shares or the equivalent value of 300% of base salary (as such
amount is calculated for purposes of the stock ownership guidelines). See ‘‘Compensation Discussion
and Analysis—Stock Ownership Guidelines, Anti-Hedging and Pledging Policies, and Other Trading
Restrictions’’ in the Company’s proxy statement filed with the SEC on March 31, 2017.

Consulting Agreement. On February 13, 2018, the Company entered into a consulting agreement
with Brian MacLean, President and Chief Operating Officer. Mr. MacLean will officially retire from
the Company effective April 2, 2018. Under the terms of the consulting agreement, Mr. MacLean will
provide strategic and other advice to the Company following his retirement and through March 31,
2019 for a fee of $50,000 per month. The foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to
the consulting agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.7 to this report.

THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC.

(Parent Company Only)

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF REGISTRANT

SCHEDULE II

1. GUARANTEES

The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV) fully and unconditionally guarantees the payment of all

principal, premiums, if any, and interest on certain debt obligations of its subsidiaries TPC and TIGHI.
The guarantees pertain to the $200 million 7.75% notes due 2026 and the $500 million 6.375% notes
due 2033.

TRV also has contingent obligations for guarantees in connection with the selling of businesses to
third parties and various indemnifications including indemnifications to service providers in the normal
course of business. The guarantees and indemnification clauses are often standard contractual terms
and include indemnifications for breaches of representations and warranties and in some cases
obligations arising from certain liabilities. The terms of these provisions vary in duration and nature.
Certain of the guarantees and indemnifications described above have no stated or notional amounts or
limitation to the maximum potential future payments, and, accordingly, TRV is unable to provide an
estimate of the maximum potential payments for such arrangements.
