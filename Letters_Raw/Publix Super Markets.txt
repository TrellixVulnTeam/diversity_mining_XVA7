2017 Annual Report to Stockholders

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Dear Stockholders and Associates, 

This year, we focused our efforts on coming together to work toward a common goal — One Publix, One Purpose. 
This is the theme we used for our retail operations conference, where we bring our store managers together to talk 
about our top focus areas and what they can do to help Publix be successful. Being One Publix, united as owners, 
with One Purpose, to be servant leaders, is part of what we believe in.  

Coming together to meet the needs of our associates, our customers and the communities we serve is critical to our 
success today and in the future. The focus of my letter this year is to show you how we’re doing just that. 

2017 summarized. 

In 2017, we achieved sales of $34.6 billion, a 1.6 percent increase over 2016, which was a 53-week fiscal year. 
Without the additional week in 2016, sales for 2017 would have increased 3.5 percent. Net earnings in 2017 were 
$2.3 billion, up 13.1 percent from 2016. Earnings per share increased to $3.04 from $2.63 the previous year. Net 
earnings and earnings per share benefited from the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Act).  
Without the benefit of the Tax Act, our net earnings would have been $2.1 billion, a 2.1 percent increase, and 
earnings per share would have been $2.74. As of March 1, 2018, our stock price was $41.40 as compared to $40.90 
on March 1, 2017.  

We also continued to invest in our fleet of stores. In 2017, we opened 44 new stores and closed 13 for a net gain     
of 31. We also remodeled 132 stores. Because we show our customers how important they are, they give us their 
loyalty by continuing to shop with us. That’s why we were ranked No. 85 on the Fortune 100 list. Delivering 
premier customer service remains our top priority. Whether our customers choose to shop in store, order online for 
grocery delivery or curbside pickup, or order ahead for products they want to pick up, our top initiatives are 
designed to fulfill the current and evolving expectations of our customers. 

Storms affected us like never before. 

Last year’s hurricane season severely affected our Publix family. I’ve never been as humbled as I was to see how 
our associates were there to support each other, our customers and our communities when they were personally 
dealing with their own recovery efforts.  

 

 

We saw our associates’ families in Texas, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and many other areas face devastating 
destruction. So, we looked for ways to help. Our associates and customers, along with Publix Charities, came 
together in amazing ways to financially assist those affected.  

Publix associates and customers gave more than $3 million to American Red Cross (ARC) through our disaster 
relief register program. Publix Charities donated $1.25 million to ARC and United Way for the hurricanes of 2017.  

Service is the core of who we are. 

We started working with Instacart in mid-2016 to offer same-day grocery delivery to our customers. Currently, 
home delivery is available to over 90 percent of our operating area. Our online delivery service supports our 
customers’ demand for choice and convenience. Late last year, we took delivery to the car door by beginning to test 
curbside pickup. This added delivery option lets our customers choose the way they want to shop with us, depending 
on the occasion. You can try our delivery service by going to publix.com/delivery or downloading our Publix 
Delivery app. 

Our customers continue to appreciate being able to order ahead when they want to pick up. In addition to the more 
than 200 sub, sliced meat and cheese, platter and decorated cake favorites, we’ve added Publix Deli smokehouse 
meats and large-count orders of fried chicken to Online Easy Ordering. If you don’t already take advantage of this 
service, consider skipping the line by ordering online at publix.com/order. 

Our pharmacies continue to collaborate with hospitals and healthcare centers to offer our retail pharmacy services 
within their facilities. Last spring, our Publix Pharmacy and BayCare Health System announced the expansion of 
our pharmacy services in the following Florida counties: Hillsborough, Pasco, Pinellas and Polk. This collaboration 
makes BayCare our sole telehealth collaborator in that region. We began offering our expanded services in January. 
This effort allows us to provide BayCare medical expertise to Publix customers and associates seeking non-urgent 
medical care as well as bring our premier service to BayCare’s patients. 

In January, we launched our new Publix Pharmacy Medications Program — where our customers can receive up to a 
90-day supply of select generic medications for only $7.50. Our pharmacy customers can also take advantage of our 
Free Medication Program that provides up to a 90-day supply of certain common prescription medications free of 
charge. Early last year, we added to our free prescriptions Montelukast, which is used for long-term treatment of 
asthma in adults and children, as well as sometimes used to treat symptoms of allergies.  

We continue to move forward. 

We opened our first stores in Virginia, and the communities there are embracing us. We also continue to have 
hundreds of associates formally submitting their interest to transfer. Our Publix family is ready to take on the 
challenge of introducing our culture to this new market.  

We also announced plans to reignite the GreenWise Market store concept — focusing on the specialty, natural and 
organic sector. Our first location will open later this year in Tallahassee, Florida, and our second site will be in 
Mount Pleasant, South Carolina. We are excited to create an environment where fresh, specialty, natural and organic 
food is celebrated. GreenWise Market will have something for everyone, from the indulgent foodie ready to 
discover something new to the health-conscious shopper seeking fresh, high-quality ingredients.

Enhancements to technology meet more needs. 

As stockholders with individual, joint or custodial accounts, you can conveniently manage your stock account 
through Publix Stockholder Online (PSO). This website allows you to view your account balance and dividend 
payment history, manage direct deposit of your dividends and update your address. And now, with recent 
enhancements to PSO, you can manage your electronic delivery preferences, including tax documents. In addition, if 
you have a PROFIT Plan account, you can now check your balance online. With each stock price announcement, 
just log in to your PSO account on corporate.publix.com/stock, which is automatically updated with the new price. If 
you’re eligible and haven’t already created your PSO account, don’t wait. It makes managing your Publix stock 
easier. 

We enhanced the experience for pharmacy patients with the launch of our pharmacy web, mobile web and mobile 
app last summer. Patients can now manage their prescription needs whenever and wherever they choose. In addition 
to online refill requests, real-time text alerts notify customers when their prescriptions are ready to pick up. They can 
also track their prescription status, set reminders to take medications and easily transfer prescriptions from a 
competitor.  

Publix people are volunteering everywhere. 

Giving back is one of the principles Mr. George founded this company on. He believed that giving back was both a 
responsibility and a privilege. And today, we continue to believe in the importance of giving. 

In April, more than 5,500 associates participated in our third annual Publix Serves Day, volunteering at more than 
150 local nonprofit organizations whose focus is primarily on the hungry and homeless. 

According to the USDA, more than 41 million Americans live in food-insecure households, including nearly          
13 million children. To help make a difference, we support food banks and agencies in the Feeding America 
network through our in-store perishable recovery program. Since the program started 10 years ago, we’ve donated 
more than 314 million pounds of perishable food, representing more than 260 million meals. 

Also in an effort to help alleviate hunger, in August, Publix Charities announced it would donate $5 million to 
Feeding America member food banks, schools and other nonprofit organizations focused on alleviating hunger 
across Publix’s operating area. Over the past three years, Publix Charities has contributed more than $11.5 million to 
hunger-related programs. 

In December, Publix Charities announced it would donate $5 million to more than 125 Habitat for Humanity 
affiliates, including those impacted by Hurricane Irma, and over 30 shelters and other nonprofit organizations across 
the Southeast. Thirty-eight Habitat for Humanity affiliates received funding for 40 new houses, and the new 
homeowners will be greeted with pantries fully stocked by Publix. 

These efforts just scratch the surface on what our associates do every day in their communities, and every year we 
support several organizations through our corporate campaign program. Last year we remained No. 1 in corporate 
giving nationally for the March of Dimes, raising more than $8.1 million. We donated $63.1million to United Way 
between the $36.5 million in associate pledges and $26.6 million from Publix Charities matching gift. We also 
raised money for Special Olympics (over $5.7 million), Children’s Miracle Network (over $5.2 million) and      
Food for All ($6.5 million).

Our people and the planet are important to us. 

We know living a lifestyle that promotes wellness is better for us. That is why we created our associate wellness 
program — Life. Inspired. The program aims to positively impact four main pillars of wellness: eat right, exercise, 
quit tobacco and achieve overall well-being. Last year, we launched our first companywide wellness challenges — 
focusing on taking more steps and eating more fruits and vegetables.  

This year, we donated $125,000 to the Arbor Day Foundation. The funds are being used to plant seedlings and trees 
in the Little Orange Creek Preserve and Withlacoochee River Watershed in Florida. But our commitment to 
sustainability goes beyond those examples. If you want to find more about our efforts, visit 
publix.com/sustainability. 

Recognitions honor our commitment to our Publix family. 

We are so passionate about serving our associates, our customers and our communities that industry organizations 
have honored us with awards and recognitions. I’ve included some of them below. 

•  New award! The Food Marketing Institute and the International Food Protection Training Institute’s 

inaugural Food Safety Innovation Award

themselves to maintaining the dignity, value and employment security of their associates — Norman

Leaders help pave our future. 

We pride ourselves on investing in our associates to help prepare them for future opportunities. I congratulate the 
associates highlighted on taking the next step in their careers. They will build on the foundation prior leaders set and 
will do their part in continuing to help with the growth and success of our company. 

Alison Midili Smith was promoted to Senior Vice President. Bob Balcerak was promoted to Vice President of Real 
Estate Strategy, and Randy Barber was promoted to Vice President of Industrial Maintenance and Purchasing. 
Marcy Benton was promoted to Vice President of Talent Management. Brad Oliver was promoted to Vice President 
of Product Business Development for Dry Grocery and Non-Foods, and Woody Rayburn was promoted to Vice 
President of Real Estate Assets. And, joining the Publix family, John Provenzano was hired as Vice President of 
Government Relations. 

Execution will win the race. 

I’ve shared some highlights from 2017. As you can see, we’re focused on being the premier quality food retailer in 
the world. We understand what it means to be Publix associates and the amazing responsibility that comes with 
being part of this family. We know that no matter our role in the company, Publix will be successful because of what 
we do today and tomorrow. We are One Publix, united as owners, with One Purpose, to be servant leaders. 

 

Thank you for all you do.

Item 1.  Business

PART I

Publix Super Markets, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (the Company) are in the business of operating retail food 
supermarkets in Florida, Georgia, Alabama, South Carolina, Tennessee, North Carolina and Virginia. The Company was founded 
in 1930 and later merged into another corporation that was originally incorporated in 1921. The Company has no other significant 
lines of business or industry segments.
Merchandising and manufacturing

The  Company  sells  grocery  (including  dairy,  produce,  deli,  bakery,  meat  and  seafood),  health  and  beauty  care,  general 
merchandise, pharmacy, floral and other products and services. The percentage of consolidated sales by merchandise category for 
2017, 2016 and 2015 was as follows:

Grocery
Other

2017
84%
16%

100%

2016
84%
16%

100%

2015
85%
15%

100%

The Company’s lines of merchandise include a variety of nationally advertised and private label brands as well as unbranded 
products such as produce, meat and seafood. The Company receives the food and nonfood products it distributes from many 
sources. These products are delivered to the supermarkets through Company distribution centers or directly from the suppliers and 
are generally available in sufficient quantities to enable the Company to adequately satisfy its customers. The Company believes 
that its sources of supply of these products and raw materials used in manufacturing are adequate for its needs and that it is not 
dependent upon a single supplier or relatively few suppliers. Approximately 77% of the total cost of products purchased is delivered 
to the supermarkets through the Company’s distribution centers. Private label items are produced in the Company’s dairy, bakery 
and deli manufacturing facilities or are manufactured for the Company by suppliers. The Company has experienced no significant 
changes in the kinds of products sold or in its methods of distribution since the beginning of the fiscal year.
Store operations

The Company operated 1,167 supermarkets at the end of 2017, compared with 1,136 at the beginning of the year. In 2017,  
44  supermarkets  were  opened  (including  nine  replacement  supermarkets)  and  132  supermarkets  were  remodeled.  Thirteen
supermarkets  were  closed  during  the  period.  The  nine  replacement  supermarkets  that  opened  in  2017  replaced  five  of  the 
supermarkets closed in 2017 and four supermarkets closed in 2016. The eight remaining supermarkets closed in 2017 will be 
replaced on site in subsequent periods. New supermarkets added 1.5 million square feet in 2017, an increase of 2.9%. At the end 
of 2017, the Company had 779 supermarkets located in Florida, 186 in Georgia, 65 in Alabama, 58 in South Carolina, 41 in 
Tennessee, 30 in North Carolina and eight in Virginia. Also, at the end of 2017, the Company had 15 supermarkets under construction 
in Florida, nine in North Carolina, four in Alabama, two in Georgia, two in Tennessee and two in Virginia.
Competition

The Company is engaged in the highly competitive retail food industry. The Company’s competitors include traditional 
supermarkets,  such  as  national  and  regional  supermarket  chains  and  independent  supermarkets,  as  well  as  nontraditional 
competitors, such as supercenters, membership warehouse clubs, mass merchandisers, dollar stores, drug stores, specialty food 
stores, restaurants, convenience stores and online retailers. The Company’s ability to attract and retain customers is based primarily 
on quality of goods and service, price, convenience, product mix and store location.  
Working capital

The Company’s working capital at the end of 2017 consisted of $4,084.9 million in current assets and $3,142.3 million in 
current liabilities. Normal operating fluctuations in these balances can result in changes to cash flows from operating activities 
presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows that are not necessarily indicative of long-term operating trends. There are 
no unusual industry practices or requirements relating to working capital items.
Seasonality

The historical influx of winter residents to Florida and increased purchases of products during the traditional Thanksgiving, 

Christmas and Easter holidays typically result in seasonal sales increases from November to April of each year.

1

Employees

The Company had 193,000 employees at the end of 2017. The Company considers its employee relations to be good.

Intellectual property

The Company’s trademarks, trade names, copyrights and similar intellectual property are important to the success of the 
Company’s business. Numerous trademarks, including “Publix” and “Where Shopping is a Pleasure,” have been registered with 
the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Due to the importance of its intellectual property to its business, the Company actively 
defends and enforces its rights to such property.
Environmental matters

The Company’s operations are subject to regulation under federal, state and local environmental protection laws and regulations. 
The Company may be subject to liability under applicable environmental laws for cleanup of contamination at its facilities. 
Compliance with these laws had no material effect on capital expenditures, results of operations or the competitive position of the 
Company.
Company information

The Company’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Proxy Statements, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 
8-K and any amendments to those reports may be obtained electronically, free of charge, through the Company’s website at 
corporate.publix.com/stock.
Item 1A.  Risk Factors

In addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be 
considered carefully in evaluating the Company’s business. The Company’s financial condition and results of operations could be 
materially and adversely affected by any of these risks.
Increased competition could adversely affect the Company.

The Company is engaged in the highly competitive retail food industry. The Company’s competitors include traditional 
supermarkets,  such  as  national  and  regional  supermarket  chains  and  independent  supermarkets,  as  well  as  nontraditional 
competitors, such as supercenters, membership warehouse clubs, mass merchandisers, dollar stores, drug stores, specialty food 
stores, restaurants, convenience stores and online retailers. There has been a trend for traditional supermarkets to lose market share 
to nontraditional competitors. The Company’s ability to attract and retain customers is based primarily on quality of goods and 
service, price, convenience, product mix and store location. The Company believes it will face increased competition in the future 
from existing and potentially new competitors and its financial condition and results of operations could be impacted by the pricing, 
purchasing, advertising or promotional decisions made by its competitors as well as competitor format innovation and location 
additions.
General economic and other conditions that impact consumer spending could adversely affect the Company.

The Company’s results of operations are sensitive to changes in general economic conditions that impact consumer spending. 
Adverse economic conditions, including high unemployment, home foreclosures and weakness in the housing market, declines in 
the stock market and the instability of the credit markets, could cause a reduction in consumer spending. While there has been a 
trend toward lower unemployment and fuel prices in recent periods which has contributed to a better economic climate, there is 
uncertainty about the continued strength of the economy. If the economy weakens, or if fuel prices increase, consumers may reduce 
consumer spending. Other conditions that could affect consumer spending include increases in tax, interest and inflation rates, 
increases in energy costs, increases in health care costs, the impact of natural disasters or acts of terrorism, and other factors. This 
reduction in the level of consumer spending could cause customers to purchase lower margin items or to shift spending to lower 
priced competitors, which could adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.
Increased operating costs could adversely affect the Company.

The Company’s operations tend to be more labor intensive than some of its competitors primarily due to the additional customer 
service offered in its supermarkets. Consequently, uncertain labor markets, government mandated increases in the minimum wage 
or other benefits, increased wage rates by retailers and other labor market competitors, an increased proportion of full-time 
employees, increased costs of health care due to health insurance reform or other factors could result in an increase in labor costs. 
In addition, the inability to improve or manage operating costs, including payroll, facilities or other non-product related costs, 
could adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.

2

Failure to execute the Company’s core strategies could adversely affect the Company.

The Company’s core strategies focus on customer service, product quality, shopping environment, competitive pricing and 
convenient locations. The Company has implemented several strategic business and technology initiatives as part of the execution 
of  these  core  strategies. The  Company  believes  these  core  strategies  and  related  strategic  initiatives  differentiate  it  from  its 
competition and present opportunities for sustained market share and financial growth. Failure to execute these core strategies, or 
failure to execute the core strategies in a cost effective manner, could adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and 
results of operations.
Failure to identify and obtain or retain suitable supermarket sites could adversely affect the Company.

The Company’s ability to obtain sites for new supermarkets is dependent on identifying and entering into lease or purchase 
agreements on commercially reasonable terms for properties that are suitable for its needs. If the Company fails to identify suitable 
sites and enter into lease or purchase agreements on a timely basis for any reason, including competition from other companies 
seeking similar sites, the Company’s growth could be adversely affected because it may be unable to open new supermarkets as 
anticipated. Similarly, its business could be adversely affected if it is unable to renew the leases on its existing leased supermarkets 
on commercially reasonable terms.
Failure to maintain the privacy and security of confidential customer and business information and the resulting unfavorable 
publicity could adversely affect the Company.

The Company receives, retains and transmits confidential information about its customers, employees and suppliers and 
entrusts certain of that information to third party service providers. The Company depends upon the secure transmission of 
confidential information, including customer payments, over external networks. Additionally, the use of individually identifiable 
data by the Company and its third party service providers is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations. An intrusion 
into or compromise of the Company’s information technology systems, or those of its third party service providers, that results in 
customer,  employee  or  supplier  information  being  obtained  by  unauthorized  persons  could  adversely  affect  the  Company’s 
reputation with existing and potential customers, employees and others. Such an intrusion or compromise could require expending 
significant resources related to remediation, lead to legal proceedings and regulatory actions, result in a disruption of operations 
and adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.
Disruptions in information technology systems could adversely affect the Company.

The Company is dependent on complex information technology systems to operate its business, enhance customer service, 
improve the efficiency of its supply chain and increase employee efficiency. Certain of these information technology systems are 
hosted by third party service providers. The Company’s information technology systems, as well as those of the Company’s third 
party service providers, are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, 
computer viruses, malicious service disruptions, catastrophic events and user errors. Significant disruptions in the information 
technology systems of the Company or its third party service providers could adversely affect the Company’s financial condition 
and results of operations.
Unexpected changes in the insurance market or factors affecting self-insurance reserve estimates could adversely affect the 
Company.

The Company uses a combination of insurance coverage and self-insurance to provide for potential liability for employee 
benefits, workers’ compensation, general liability, fleet liability and directors and officers liability. The Company is self-insured 
for property, plant and equipment losses. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to maintain its insurance 
coverage or obtain comparable insurance coverage on commercially reasonable terms. Self-insurance reserves are determined 
based on actual claims experience and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported including, where necessary, actuarial studies. 
Actuarial projections of losses are subject to variability caused by, but not limited to, such factors as future interest and inflation 
rates, future economic conditions, claims experience, litigation trends and benefit level changes. An increase in the frequency or 
costs of claims, changes in actuarial assumptions or catastrophic events involving property, plant and equipment losses could 
adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.
Product liability claims, product recalls and the resulting unfavorable publicity could adversely affect the Company.

The distribution and sale of grocery, drug and other products purchased from suppliers or manufactured by the Company 
entails an inherent risk of product liability claims, product recalls and the resulting adverse publicity. Such products may contain 
contaminants that may be inadvertently sold by the Company. These contaminants may, in certain cases, result in illness, injury 
or death if processing at the consumer level, if applicable, does not eliminate the contaminants. Even an inadvertent shipment of 
adulterated products may be a violation of law and may lead to a product recall and/or an increased risk of exposure to product 
liability claims. There can be no assurance that such claims will not be asserted against the Company or that the Company will 
not be obligated to perform product recalls in the future. If a product liability claim is successful, the Company’s insurance coverage 
may not be adequate to pay all liabilities, and the Company may not be able to continue to maintain such insurance coverage or 
obtain comparable insurance coverage on commercially reasonable terms. If the Company does not have adequate insurance 
coverage or contractual indemnification available, product liability claims could have an adverse effect on the Company’s ability 

3

to successfully market its products and on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. In addition, even if a product 
liability claim is not successful or is not fully pursued, the adverse publicity surrounding any assertion that the Company’s products 
caused illness or injury could have an adverse effect on the Company’s reputation with existing and potential customers and on 
the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.
Unfavorable changes in, failure to comply with or increased costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations could 
adversely affect the Company.

The  Company  is  subject  to  federal,  state  and  local  laws  and  regulations  that  govern  activities  that  may  have  adverse 
environmental effects and impose liabilities for the costs of contamination cleanup and damages arising from sites of past spills, 
disposals or other releases of hazardous materials. Under current environmental laws, the Company may be held responsible for 
the remediation of environmental conditions regardless of whether the Company leases, subleases or owns the supermarkets or 
other facilities and regardless of whether such environmental conditions were created by the Company or a prior owner or tenant. 
The costs of investigation, remediation or removal of environmental conditions may be substantial. In addition, the increased focus 
on climate change, waste management and other environmental issues may result in new environmental laws or regulations that 
could adversely affect the Company directly or indirectly through increased costs on its suppliers. There can be no assurance that 
environmental conditions relating to prior, existing or future sites or other environmental changes will not adversely affect the 
Company’s financial condition and results of operations through, for instance, business interruption, cost of remediation or adverse 
publicity.
Unfavorable changes in, failure to comply with or increased costs to comply with laws and regulations could adversely affect 
the Company.

In addition to environmental laws and regulations, the Company is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations 
relating to, among other things, product labeling and safety, zoning, land use, workplace safety, public health, accessibility and 
restrictions on the sale of various products, including alcoholic beverages, tobacco and drugs. The Company is also subject to laws 
governing its relationship with employees, including minimum wage requirements, overtime, working conditions, disabled access 
and work permit requirements. Compliance with, or changes in, these laws, the passage of new laws and increased government 
regulation could adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.
Unfavorable results of legal proceedings could adversely affect the Company.

The Company is subject from time to time to various lawsuits, claims and charges arising in the normal course of business, 
including employment, personal injury, commercial and other matters. Some lawsuits also contain class action allegations. The 
Company estimates its exposure to these legal proceedings and establishes reserves for the estimated liabilities. Assessing and 
predicting the outcome of these matters involves substantial uncertainties. Although not currently anticipated by the Company, 
differences in actual outcomes or changes in the Company’s evaluation could adversely affect the Company’s financial condition 
and results of operations.

Item 2.  Properties

At year end, the Company operated 54.9 million square feet of supermarket space. The Company’s supermarkets vary in size. 
Current supermarket prototypes range from 28,000 to 61,000 square feet. Supermarkets are often located in shopping centers where 
the Company is the anchor tenant. The majority of the Company’s supermarkets are leased. Substantially all of these leases will 
expire during the next 20 years. However, in the normal course of business, it is expected that the leases will be renewed or replaced 
by new leases. Both the building and land are owned at 302 locations. The building is owned while the land is leased at 69 other 
locations.

The Company supplies its supermarkets from nine primary distribution centers located in Lakeland, Miami, Jacksonville, 
Sarasota, Orlando, Deerfield Beach and Boynton Beach, Florida, Lawrenceville, Georgia and McCalla, Alabama. The Company 
operates  six  manufacturing  facilities,  including  three  dairy  plants  located  in  Lakeland  and  Deerfield  Beach,  Florida  and 
Lawrenceville, Georgia, two bakery plants located in Lakeland, Florida and Atlanta, Georgia and a deli plant located in Lakeland, 
Florida.

The Company’s corporate offices, primary distribution centers and manufacturing facilities are owned with no outstanding 

debt. The Company’s properties are well maintained, in good operating condition and suitable for operating its business.

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings 

The Company is subject from time to time to various lawsuits, claims and charges arising in the normal course of business. 
The Company believes its recorded reserves are adequate in light of the probable and estimable liabilities. The estimated amount 
of reasonably possible losses for lawsuits, claims and charges, individually and in the aggregate, is considered to be immaterial. 
In the opinion of management, the ultimate resolution of these legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the 
Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Item 5.  Market for the Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
(a)  Market Information

The Company’s common stock is not traded on an established securities market. Substantially all transactions of the Company’s 
common stock have been among the Company, its employees, former employees, their families and the benefit plans established 
for the Company’s employees. Common stock is made available for sale by the Company only to its current employees and 
members of its Board of Directors through the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) and Non-Employee Directors 
Stock Purchase Plan (Directors Plan) and to participants of the Company’s 401(k) Plan. In addition, common stock is provided 
to employees through the Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP). The Company currently repurchases common stock 
subject to certain terms and conditions. The ESPP, Directors Plan, 401(k) Plan and ESOP each contain provisions prohibiting 
any transfer for value without the owner first offering the common stock to the Company. The Company serves as the registrar 
and stock transfer agent for its common stock.
Because there is no trading of the Company’s common stock on an established securities market, the market price of the 
Company’s common stock is determined by its Board of Directors. As part of the process to determine the market price, an 
independent valuation is obtained. The process includes comparing the Company’s financial results to those of comparable 
companies that are publicly traded (comparable publicly traded companies). The purpose of the process is to determine a value 
for the Company’s common stock that is comparable to the stock value of comparable publicly traded companies by considering 
both the results of the stock market and the relative financial results of comparable publicly traded companies. The market 
prices for the Company’s common stock for 2017 and 2016 were as follows:

January - February
March - April
May - July
August - October
November - December

capital requirements and the financial condition of the Company. However, the Company intends to continue to pay comparable 
dividends to stockholders in the future.

(1)  Common stock is made available for sale by the Company only to its current employees and members of its Board of Directors through the ESPP and Directors 
Plan and to participants of the 401(k) Plan. In addition, common stock is provided to employees through the ESOP. The Company currently repurchases 
common stock subject to certain terms and conditions. The ESPP, Directors Plan, 401(k) Plan and ESOP each contain provisions prohibiting any transfer for 
value without the owner first offering the common stock to the Company.
The Company’s common stock is not traded on an established securities market. The amount of common stock offered to the Company for repurchase is not 
within the control of the Company, but is at the discretion of the stockholders. The Company does not believe that these repurchases of its common stock 
are within the scope of a publicly announced plan or program (although the terms of the plans discussed above have been communicated to the participants). 
Thus, the Company does not believe that it has made any repurchases during the three months ended December 30, 2017 required to be disclosed in the last

(e)  Performance Graph

The following performance graph sets forth the Company’s cumulative total stockholder return during the five years ended 
December 30, 2017, compared to the cumulative total return on the S&P 500 Index and a custom Peer Group Index including 
retail food supermarket companies.(1) The Peer Group Index is weighted based on the various companies’ market capitalization. 
The comparison assumes $100 was invested at the end of 2012 in the Company’s common stock and in each of the related 
indices and assumes reinvestment of dividends.
The Company’s common stock is valued as of the end of each fiscal quarter. After the end of a quarter, however, shares continue 
to be traded at the prior valuation until the new valuation is received. The cumulative total return for the companies represented 
in the S&P 500 Index and the custom Peer Group Index is based on those companies’ trading price as of the Company’s fiscal 
year end. The following performance graph is based on the Company’s trading price at fiscal year end based on its market 
price as of the prior fiscal quarter. For comparative purposes, a performance graph based on the fiscal year end valuation 
(market price as of March 1, 2018) is provided in the 2018 Proxy Statement. Past stock performance shown below is no 
guarantee of future performance.

Item 7.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Overview

The Company is engaged in the retail food industry, operating supermarkets in Florida, Georgia, Alabama, South Carolina, 
Tennessee, North Carolina and Virginia. The Company has no other significant lines of business or industry segments. As of 
December 30, 2017, the Company operated 1,167 supermarkets including 779 located in Florida, 186 in Georgia, 65 in Alabama, 
58 in South Carolina, 41 in Tennessee, 30 in North Carolina and eight in Virginia. In 2017, 44 supermarkets were opened (including 
nine replacement supermarkets) and 132 supermarkets were remodeled. During 2017, the Company opened 17 supermarkets in 
Florida, 11 in North Carolina, eight in Virginia, two in Georgia, two in Alabama, two in South Carolina and two in Tennessee. 
Thirteen supermarkets were closed during the period. The nine replacement supermarkets that opened in 2017 replaced five of the 
supermarkets closed in 2017 and four supermarkets closed in 2016. The eight remaining supermarkets closed in 2017 will be 
replaced  on  site  in  subsequent  periods.  In  the  normal  course  of  operations,  the  Company  replaces  supermarkets  and  closes 
supermarkets that are not meeting performance expectations. The impact of future supermarket closings is not expected to be 
material.

The Company’s revenues are earned and cash is generated as merchandise is sold to customers. Income is earned by selling 
merchandise at price levels that produce sales in excess of the cost of merchandise sold and operating and administrative expenses. 
The Company has generally been able to increase revenues and net earnings from year to year. Further, the Company has been 
able to meet its cash requirements from internally generated funds without the need for debt financing. The Company’s year end 
cash balances are impacted by its operating results as well as by capital expenditures, investment transactions, common stock 
repurchases and dividend payments.

The Company sells a variety of merchandise to generate revenues. This merchandise includes grocery (including dairy, produce, 
deli, bakery, meat and seafood), health and beauty care, general merchandise and other products and services. Most of the Company’s 
supermarkets also have pharmacy and floral departments. Merchandise includes a variety of nationally advertised and private label 
brands as well as unbranded products such as produce, meat and seafood. The Company’s private label brands play an important 
role in its merchandising strategy.
Operating Environment

The Company is engaged in the highly competitive retail food industry. The Company’s competitors include traditional 
supermarkets,  such  as  national  and  regional  supermarket  chains  and  independent  supermarkets,  as  well  as  nontraditional 
competitors, such as supercenters, membership warehouse clubs, mass merchandisers, dollar stores, drug stores, specialty food 
stores, restaurants, convenience stores and online retailers. The Company’s ability to attract and retain customers is based primarily 
on quality of goods and service, price, convenience, product mix and store location. In addition, the Company competes with other 
companies for additional retail site locations. The Company also competes with retailers and other labor market competitors in 
attracting and retaining quality employees. As a result of the highly competitive environment, traditional supermarkets, including 
the Company, face business challenges. There has been a trend for traditional supermarkets to lose market share to nontraditional 
competitors. The Company’s ability to retain its customers depends on its ability to meet the business challenges created by this 
highly competitive environment.

In order to meet its competitive challenges, the Company continues to focus on its core strategies, including customer service, 
product quality, shopping environment, competitive pricing and convenient locations. The Company has implemented several 
strategic business and technology initiatives as part of the execution of these core strategies. The Company believes these core 
strategies and related strategic initiatives differentiate it from its competition and present opportunities for sustained market share 
and financial growth.
Hurricane Impact

In September 2017, the Company was impacted by Hurricane Irma. Temporary supermarket closings occurred primarily in 
Florida due to weather conditions and evacuations of certain areas. Almost all affected supermarkets were reopened within two 
days following the passing of Hurricane Irma, operating on generator power if normal power had not been restored. All supermarkets 
were reopened within six days except one supermarket in Key West, Florida, which reopened the following week.

The Company estimates that its sales increased $250 million due to the impact of Hurricane Irma. The Company incurred 
additional costs for inventory losses due to power outages, fuel for generators and facility repairs and clean-up totaling an estimated 
$25 million. The Company is self-insured for these losses. The Company estimates the profit on the incremental sales resulting 
from customers stocking up and replenishing, as well as sales of hurricane supplies, more than offset the losses incurred.

Results of Operations

year 2016 includes 53 weeks. 
Sales

The Company’s fiscal year ends on the last Saturday in December. Fiscal years 2017 and 2015 include 52 weeks and fiscal 

Sales for 2017 were $34.6 billion as compared with $34.0 billion in 2016, an increase of $558.4 million or 1.6%. Excluding 
the effect of the additional week in 2016, sales for 2017 as compared with 2016 would have increased 3.5%. After excluding the 
effect of the additional week in 2016, the increase in sales for 2017 as compared with 2016 was primarily due to a 1.7% increase 
in comparable store sales (supermarkets open for the same weeks in both periods, including replacement supermarkets) and new 
supermarket sales. Comparable store sales for 2017 increased primarily due to increased product costs and the impact of Hurricane 
Irma. The Company estimates that its sales increased $250 million or 0.7% due to the hurricane. Sales for supermarkets that are 
replaced on site are classified as new supermarket sales since the replacement period for the supermarket is generally 9 to 12 months.
Sales for 2016 were $34.0 billion as compared with $32.4 billion in 2015, an increase of $1,637.3 million or 5.1%. The increase 
in sales for 2016 as compared with 2015 was primarily due to a 1.9% increase in sales from the additional week in 2016 and a 
1.9% increase in comparable store sales. Comparable store sales for 2016 increased primarily due to increased product costs and 
customer counts.
Gross profit

Gross profit (sales less cost of merchandise sold) as a percentage of sales was 27.3% in 2017 and 2016 and 27.5% in 2015. 
Excluding the last-in, first-out (LIFO) reserve effect of $23.0 million, $(4.6) million and $26.0 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, 
respectively, gross profit as a percentage of sales would have been 27.3%,  27.2% and 27.6% in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
After excluding the LIFO reserve effect, gross profit as a percentage of sales for 2017 as compared with 2016 remained relatively 
unchanged. After excluding the LIFO reserve effect, the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales for 2016 as compared 
with 2015 was primarily due to an increase in promotional activities.
Operating and administrative expenses

Operating and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 20.2% in 2017 and 20.0% in 2016 and 2015. The increase 
in operating and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales for 2017 as compared with 2016 was primarily due to increases 
in facility costs as a percentage of sales. Operating and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales for 2016 as compared 
with 2015 remained unchanged primarily due to a decrease in rent as a percentage of sales due to the acquisition of shopping 
centers with the Company as the anchor tenant offset by an increase in payroll as a percentage of sales.
Investment income

Investment income was $226.6 million, $133.1 million and $156.0 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase 
in investment income for 2017 as compared with 2016 was primarily due to an increase in realized gains on the sale of equity 
securities. The decrease in investment income for 2016 as compared with 2015 was primarily due to a decrease in realized gains 
on the sale of equity securities partially offset by an increase in interest income.
Income tax expense

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Act) was signed into law making significant changes to the 
Internal Revenue Code. Changes include, among others, a decrease in the federal statutory income tax rate from 35% to 21% 
beginning in 2018. The impact of the reduction of the federal statutory income tax rate decreased the Company’s income tax 
expense for 2017 by $224.2 million due to the remeasurement of deferred income taxes.

The effective income tax rate was 24.3%, 31.1% and 31.5% in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in the effective 
income tax rate for 2017 as compared with 2016 was primarily due to the impact of the Tax Act partially offset by a decrease in 
investment related tax credits. Excluding the impact of the Tax Act, the effective income tax rate would have been 31.7% in 2017. 
The decrease in the effective income tax rate for 2016 as compared with 2015 was primarily due to increases in qualified inventory 
donations, deductions for manufacturing production costs and investment related tax credits partially offset by the effect of a state 
income tax settlement in 2015.
Net earnings

Net earnings were $2,291.9 million or $3.04 per share, $2,025.7 million or $2.63 per share and $1,965.0 million or $2.54 per 
share for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Net earnings as a percentage of sales were 6.6%, 6.0% and 6.1% for 2017, 2016 and 
2015, respectively. The increase in net earnings as a percentage of sales for 2017 as compared with 2016 was primarily due to the 
impact of the Tax Act. Excluding the impact of the Tax Act, net earnings would have been $2,067.7 million or $2.74 per share and 
6.0% as a percentage of sales for 2017. The decrease in net earnings as a percentage of sales for 2016 as compared with 2015 was 
primarily due to the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales partially offset by the incremental profit from the additional 
week in 2016. 

10

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term investments totaled $7,013.2 million as of December 30, 
2017, as compared with $7,176.9 million as of December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to the increase in common 
stock repurchases, partially offset by the extension of the September 15, 2017 and December 15, 2017 federal income tax payments 
until January 31, 2018 due to Hurricane Irma.
Net cash provided by operating activities

Net cash provided by operating activities was $3,580.3 million, $3,253.0 million and $2,941.4 million in 2017, 2016 and 
2015, respectively. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities for 2017 as compared with 2016 was primarily due 
to the extension of the federal income tax payments due to Hurricane Irma. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities 
for 2016 as compared with 2015 was primarily due to the timing of the Company’s fiscal year end relative to the Christmas holiday. 
Net cash used in investing activities

Net cash used in investing activities was $1,236.1 million, $1,806.1 million and $1,846.5 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, 
respectively. The primary use of net cash in investing activities for 2017 was funding capital expenditures, partially offset by net 
decreases in investment securities. Capital expenditures for 2017 totaled $1,429.1 million. These expenditures were incurred in 
connection with the opening of 44 new supermarkets (including nine replacement supermarkets) and remodeling 132 supermarkets. 
Expenditures were also incurred for supermarkets and remodels in progress, new or enhanced information technology hardware 
and applications and the acquisition of shopping centers with the Company as the anchor tenant. In 2017, the proceeds from the 
sale and maturity of investments, net of the payment for such investments, were $186.7 million. The primary use of net cash in 
investing activities for 2016 was funding capital expenditures and net increases in investment securities. Capital expenditures for 
2016 totaled $1,443.8 million. These expenditures were incurred in connection with the opening of 32 new supermarkets (including 
seven  replacement  supermarkets)  and  remodeling  156  supermarkets.  Expenditures  were  also  incurred  for  supermarkets  and 
remodels in progress, new or enhanced information technology hardware and applications and the acquisition of shopping centers 
with the Company as the anchor tenant. In 2016, the payment for investments, net of the proceeds from the sale and maturity of 
such investments, was $368.5 million.
Net cash used in financing activities

Net cash used in financing activities was $2,202.6 million, $1,360.7 million and $1,150.2 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, 
respectively. The primary use of net cash in financing activities was funding net common stock repurchases and dividend payments. 
Net common stock repurchases totaled $1,468.6 million, $630.2 million and $510.5 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
The Company currently repurchases common stock at the stockholders’ request in accordance with the terms of the ESPP, Directors 
Plan, 401(k) Plan and ESOP. The amount of common stock offered to the Company for repurchase is not within the control of the 
Company, but is at the discretion of the stockholders. The Company expects to continue to repurchase its common stock, as offered 
by its stockholders from time to time, at its then current value. However, with the exception of certain shares distributed from the 
ESOP, such purchases are not required and the Company retains the right to discontinue them at any time.
Dividends

The Company paid quarterly dividends on its common stock totaling $0.9125 per share or $689.7 million, $0.8675 per share 

or $667.9 million and $0.79 per share or $612.8 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
Capital expenditure projection

Capital expenditures expected to use cash in 2018 are approximately $1,530 million, primarily consisting of new supermarkets, 
remodeling existing supermarkets, new or enhanced information technology hardware and applications and the acquisition of 
shopping centers with the Company as the anchor tenant. The shopping center acquisitions are financed with internally generated 
funds and assumed debt, if prepayment penalties for the debt are determined to be significant. This capital program is subject to 
continuing change and review. 
Cash requirements

In 2018, the cash requirements for operations, capital expenditures, common stock repurchases and dividend payments are 
expected to be financed by internally generated funds or liquid assets. Based on the Company’s financial position, it is expected 
that short-term and long-term borrowings would be available to support the Company’s liquidity requirements, if needed.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In February 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an Accounting Standards Update (ASU) in 
response to the Tax Act. The ASU permits companies to reclassify stranded tax effects due to the reduction of the federal statutory 
income tax rate from accumulated other comprehensive earnings to retained earnings. The ASU is effective for reporting periods 
beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted. The Company elected to adopt the ASU early and reclassified 
$27.1 million from accumulated other comprehensive earnings to retained earnings as of December 30, 2017.

 In June 2016, the FASB issued an ASU requiring companies to change the methodology used to measure credit losses on 
financial instruments.  The ASU is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019 with early adoption permitted 
only for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018.  The Company does not expect the adoption of the ASU to have a 
material effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. The adoption of the ASU will have no effect on the 
Company’s cash flows.

In February 2016, the FASB issued an ASU on lease accounting. The ASU requires the lease rights and obligations arising 
from lease contracts, including existing and new arrangements, to be recognized as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. The 
ASU is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted. While the Company is 
still evaluating the ASU, the Company expects the adoption of the ASU to have a material effect on the Company’s financial 
condition due to the recognition of approximately $3 billion of lease rights and obligations as assets and liabilities on the consolidated 
balance sheets. The Company does not expect the adoption of the ASU to have a material effect on the Company’s results of 
operations. The adoption of the ASU will have no effect on the Company’s cash flows.

In January 2016, the FASB issued an ASU requiring companies to measure equity securities at fair value with changes in fair 
value recognized in net earnings as opposed to other comprehensive earnings. The ASU is effective for reporting periods beginning 
after December 15, 2017. The adoption of the ASU will have an effect on the Company’s results of operations. The extent of the 
effect on results of operations will vary with the changes in the fair value of equity securities. The adoption of the ASU will have 
no effect on the Company’s financial condition or cash flows.

In November 2015, the FASB issued an ASU requiring companies to classify deferred tax assets and liabilities in the noncurrent 
section of the balance sheet effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. In 2017, the Company retrospectively 
adopted  the ASU  and  reclassified  $77.5  million  from  current  deferred  tax  assets  to  noncurrent  deferred  income  taxes  as  of 
December 31, 2016.

In May 2014, the FASB issued an ASU on the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. The ASU requires 
additional disclosures about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts. 
The ASU is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company does not expect the adoption of the 
ASU to have a material effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
Critical Accounting Estimates

The Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company’s 
consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect 
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated 
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ 
from those estimates. The Company’s significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements. The Company believes the following involves significant estimates and judgments in the preparation of its consolidated 
financial statements.
Self-Insurance Reserves

Self-insurance reserves are established for health care, workers’ compensation, general liability and fleet liability claims. 
These reserves are determined based on actual claims experience and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported including, 
where necessary, actuarial studies. The Company believes that the use of actuarial studies to determine self-insurance reserves 
represents a consistent method of measuring these subjective estimates. Actuarial projections of losses for general liability and 
workers’ compensation claims are discounted and subject to variability. The causes of variability include, but are not limited to, 
such factors as future interest and inflation rates, future economic conditions, claims experience, litigation trends and benefit level 
changes.  Historically,  there  have  not  been  significant  changes  in  the  factors  and  assumptions  used  in  the  valuation  of  the                              
self-insurance reserves. However, significant changes in such factors and assumptions could materially impact the valuation of 
the self-insurance reserves.

13

Forward-Looking Statements

From  time  to  time,  certain  information  provided  by  the  Company,  including  written  or  oral  statements  made  by  its 
representatives, may contain forward-looking information as defined in Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
Forward-looking information includes statements about the future performance of the Company, which is based on management’s 
assumptions and beliefs in light of the information currently available to them. When used, the words “plan,” “estimate,” “project,” 
“intend,” “expect,” “believe” and other similar expressions, as they relate to the Company, are intended to identify such forward-
looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results 
to differ materially from those statements including, but not limited to, the following: competitive practices and pricing in the food 
and drug industries generally and particularly in the Company’s principal markets; results of programs to increase sales, including 
private label sales; results of programs to control or reduce costs; changes in buying, pricing and promotional practices; changes 
in shrink management; changes in the general economy; changes in consumer spending; changes in population, employment and 
job growth in the Company’s principal markets; and other factors affecting the Company’s business within or beyond the Company’s 
control. These factors include changes in the rate of inflation, changes in federal, state and local laws and regulations, adverse 
determinations with respect to litigation or other claims, ability to recruit and retain employees, increases in operating costs 
including, but not limited to, labor costs, credit card fees and utility costs, particularly electric rates, ability to construct new 
supermarkets or complete remodels as rapidly as planned and stability of product costs. Other factors and assumptions not identified 
above could also cause the actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Except as may 
be required by applicable law, the Company assumes no obligation to publicly update these forward-looking statements.

Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

The Company does not utilize financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes, nor does it utilize leveraged 

financial instruments.

Cash equivalents and short-term investments are subject to three market risks, namely interest rate risk, credit risk and secondary 
market risk. Most of the cash equivalents and short-term investments are held in money market investments and debt securities 
that mature in less than one year. Due to the quality of the short-term investments held, the Company does not expect the valuation 
of these investments to be significantly impacted by future market conditions.

Debt securities are subject to both interest rate risk and credit risk. Debt securities held by the Company at year end primarily 
consisted of corporate, state and municipal bonds with high credit ratings; therefore, the Company believes the credit risk is low. 
The Company believes a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an immaterial unrealized loss on its debt securities. 
Since the Company does not intend to sell its debt securities or will likely not be required to sell its debt securities prior to any 
anticipated recovery, such a hypothetical temporary unrealized loss would impact comprehensive earnings, but not net earnings 
or cash flows.

Equity securities are subject to equity price risk that results from fluctuations in quoted market prices as of the balance sheet 
date. Market price fluctuations may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the issuer, the 
relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions. A hypothetical decrease of 5% in the value of the Company’s 
equity securities would result in an immaterial decrease in the value of such long-term investments.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Stockholders and Board of Directors
Publix Super Markets, Inc.:
Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Publix Super Markets, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as 
of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive earnings, cash 
flows and stockholders’ equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 30, 2017, and the related notes and 
the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our 
opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of 
December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the                  
three-year period ended December 30, 2017, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an 
opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public 
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company 
in  accordance with the  U.S.  federal securities  laws  and the  applicable rules and  regulations of  the  Securities and  Exchange 
Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the 
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether 
due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over 
financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting 
but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. 
Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, 
whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a 
test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included 
evaluating  the  accounting  principles  used  and  significant  estimates  made  by  management,  as  well  as  evaluating  the  overall 
presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
/s/ KPMG LLP
We have not been able to determine the specific year that we began serving as the Company’s auditor, however we are aware that 
we have served as the Company’s auditor since at least 1965.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(1)  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

(a)  Business

Publix Super Markets, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (the Company) are in the business of operating retail food 
supermarkets in Florida, Georgia, Alabama, South Carolina, Tennessee, North Carolina and Virginia. The Company was 
founded in 1930 and later merged into another corporation that was originally incorporated in 1921. The Company has 
no other significant lines of business or industry segments. See percentage of consolidated sales by merchandise category 
on page 1.

(b)  Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its wholly owned subsidiaries and certain 
joint ventures in which the Company has a controlling financial interest. All significant intercompany balances and 
transactions are eliminated in consolidation.

(c)  Fiscal Year

The Company’s fiscal year ends on the last Saturday in December. Fiscal years 2017 and 2015 include 52 weeks and 
fiscal year 2016 includes 53 weeks.

(d)  Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all liquid investments with maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

(e)  Trade Receivables

Trade receivables primarily include amounts due from vendor allowances, debit and credit card sales and third party 
insurance pharmacy billings.

(f)  Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. The dollar value last-in, first-out (LIFO) method was used to 
determine the cost for 85% and 83% of inventories as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. Under 
this method, inventory is stated at cost, which is determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to each similar merchandise 
category’s ending retail value. The cost of the remaining inventories was determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) 
method. The  FIFO  cost  of  inventory  approximates  replacement  or  current  cost. The  FIFO  method  is  used  to  value 
manufactured, seasonal, certain perishable and other miscellaneous inventory items because of fluctuating costs and 
inconsistent  product  availability. The  Company  also  reduces  inventory  for  estimated  losses  related  to  shrink.  If  all 
inventories were valued using the FIFO method, inventories and current assets would have been higher than reported by 
$464,888,000 and $441,860,000 as of  December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.

(g)  Investments

Debt and equity securities are classified as available-for-sale (AFS) and carried at fair value. The Company evaluates 
whether AFS securities are other-than-temporarily impaired (OTTI) based on criteria that include the extent to which cost 
exceeds market value, the duration of the market value decline, the credit rating of the issuer or security, the failure of 
the issuer to make scheduled principal or interest payments and the financial health and prospects of the issuer or security.
Declines in the value of AFS securities determined to be OTTI are recognized in earnings and reported as OTTI losses. 
Debt securities with unrealized losses are considered OTTI if the Company intends to sell the debt security or if the 
Company will be required to sell the debt security prior to any anticipated recovery. If the Company determines that a 
debt security is OTTI under these circumstances, the impairment recognized in earnings is measured as the difference 
between the amortized cost and the current fair value. A debt security is also determined to be OTTI if the Company does 
not expect to recover the amortized cost of the debt security. However, in this circumstance, if the Company does not 
intend to sell the debt security and will not be required to sell the debt security, the impairment recognized in earnings 
equals the estimated credit loss as measured by the difference between the present value of expected cash flows and the 
amortized cost of the debt security. Expected cash flows are discounted using the debt security’s effective interest rate. 
An equity security is determined to be OTTI if the Company does not expect to recover the cost of the equity security. 
Declines in the value of AFS securities determined to be temporary are reported net of income taxes as other comprehensive 
losses and included as a component of stockholders’ equity. 
Interest and dividend income, amortization of premiums, accretion of discounts and realized gains and losses on AFS 
securities are included in investment income. Interest income is accrued as earned. Dividend income is recognized as 
income on the ex-dividend date of the security. The cost of AFS securities sold is based on the FIFO method.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(h)  Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation

Assets are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives or the terms 
of the related leases, if shorter, as follows:

Buildings and improvements
Furniture, fixtures and equipment
Leasehold improvements

 

10–40 years
3–20 years
10–20 years

Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Expenditures for renewals and betterments are capitalized. The gain 
or loss realized on disposed assets or assets to be disposed of is recorded as operating and administrative expenses.

(i)  Long-Lived Assets

The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that 
the net book value of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a 
comparison of the net book value of an asset to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the 
asset. An impairment loss is recorded for the excess of the net book value over the fair value of the asset. The fair value 
is estimated based on expected discounted future cash flows. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the 
carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell and are no longer depreciated. Long-lived assets, including buildings and 
improvements,  leasehold  improvements,  and  furniture,  fixtures  and  equipment,  are  evaluated  for  impairment  at  the 
supermarket level.

(j)  Self-Insurance

The Company is self-insured for health care claims and property, plant and equipment losses. The Company has insurance 
coverage for losses in excess of self-insurance limits for workers’ compensation, general liability and fleet liability claims. 
Self-insurance reserves are established for health care, workers’ compensation, general liability and fleet liability claims. 
These reserves are determined based on actual claims experience and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported 
including,  where  necessary,  actuarial  studies.  Actuarial  projections  of  losses  for  general  liability  and  workers’ 
compensation claims are discounted.

(k)  Postretirement Benefit

The Company provides a postretirement life insurance benefit for certain salaried and hourly full-time employees who 
meet the eligibility requirements. Effective January 1, 2002, the Company amended the postretirement life insurance 
benefit under its Group Life Insurance Plan. To receive the postretirement life insurance benefit after the amendment, an 
employee must have had at least five years of full-time service and the employee’s age plus years of credited service must 
have equaled 65 or greater as of October 1, 2001. At retirement, such employees also must be at least age 55 with at least 
10 years of full-time service to be eligible to receive the postretirement life insurance benefit.
Actuarial projections are used to calculate the year end postretirement benefit obligation, discounted using a yield curve 
methodology based on high quality bonds with a rating of AA or better. Actuarial losses are amortized from accumulated 
other comprehensive earnings into net periodic postretirement benefit cost over future years when the accumulation of 
such losses exceeds 10% of the year end postretirement benefit obligation.

(l)  Comprehensive Earnings

Comprehensive earnings include net earnings and other comprehensive earnings. Other comprehensive earnings include 
revenues, expenses, gains and losses that have been excluded from net earnings and recorded directly to stockholders’ 
equity. Included in other comprehensive earnings for the Company are unrealized gains and losses on AFS securities and 
adjustments to the postretirement benefit obligation.

(m) Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognized at the point of sale for retail sales. Customer returns are immaterial. Vendor coupons that are 
reimbursed are accounted for as sales. Coupons and other sales incentives offered by the Company that are not reimbursed 
are recorded as a reduction of sales.

(n)  Sales Taxes

The Company records sales net of applicable sales taxes.

26

PUBLIX SUPER MARKETS, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(o)  Other Operating Income

Other operating income is recognized on a net revenue basis as earned. Other operating income includes income generated 
from other activities, primarily lottery commissions, licensee sales commissions, mall gift card commissions, automated 
teller transaction fees, money transfer fees, vending machine commissions and coupon redemption income.

(p)  Cost of Merchandise Sold

Cost of merchandise sold includes costs of inventory and costs related to in-store production. Cost of merchandise sold 
also includes inbound freight charges, purchasing and receiving costs, warehousing costs and other costs of the Company’s 
distribution network.
Allowances and credits, including cooperative advertising allowances, received from a vendor in connection with the 
purchase or promotion of the vendor’s products are recognized as a reduction of cost of merchandise sold as earned. 
These allowances and credits are recognized as earned in accordance with the underlying agreement with the vendor and 
completion of the earnings process. Short-term vendor agreements with advance payment provisions are recorded as a 
current liability and recognized over the appropriate period as earned according to the underlying agreements. Long-term 
vendor agreements with advance payment provisions are recorded as a noncurrent liability and recognized over the 
appropriate period as earned according to the underlying agreements.

(q)  Advertising Costs

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and were $251,933,000, $260,367,000 and $248,454,000 for 2017, 2016 and 
2015, respectively.

(r)  Other Nonoperating Income, net

Other nonoperating income, net includes rent received from tenants in owned shopping centers, net of related expenses, 
and other miscellaneous nonoperating income.

(s)  Income Taxes

Deferred  income  taxes  are  established  for  temporary  differences  between  financial  and  tax  reporting  bases  and  are 
subsequently adjusted to reflect changes in income tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences 
reverse. In 2017, the Company retrospectively adopted an Accounting Standards Update (ASU) requiring companies to 
classify deferred tax assets and liabilities in the noncurrent section of the consolidated balance sheet and reclassified 
$77,496,000 from current deferred tax assets to noncurrent deferred income taxes as of December 31, 2016. The Company 
recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities as a component of income tax expense. The 
Company invests in certain investment related tax credits that promote affordable housing and renewable energy. These 
investments generate a return primarily through the realization of federal and state tax credits and other tax benefits. The 
Company accounts for its affordable housing investments using the proportional amortization method. Under this method, 
the investment is amortized into income tax expense in proportion to the tax credits received and the investment tax credits 
are recognized as a reduction of income tax expense. The Company accounts for its renewable energy investments using 
the deferral method. Under this method, the investment tax credits are recognized as a reduction of the renewable energy 
investments.

(t)  Common Stock and Earnings Per Share

Basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing net earnings by the weighted average shares outstanding. 
Basic and diluted earnings per share are the same because the Company does not have options or other stock compensation 
programs that impact the calculation of diluted earnings per share. All shares owned by the Employee Stock Ownership 
Plan (ESOP) are included in the earnings per share calculations. Dividends paid to the ESOP, as well as dividends on all 
other common stock shares, are reflected as a reduction of retained earnings. All common stock shares, including ESOP 
and 401(k) Plan shares, receive one vote per share and have the same dividend rights. The voting rights for ESOP shares 
allocated to participants’ accounts are passed through to the participants. The Trustee of the Company’s common stock 
in the 401(k) Plan votes the shares held in that plan.

(u)  Use of Estimates

The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  requires 
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure 
of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and 
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(2)  Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The fair value of certain of the Company’s financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and 
accounts payable, approximates their respective carrying amounts due to their short-term maturity.
The fair value of AFS securities is based on market prices using the following measurement categories:

Level 1 – Fair value is determined by using quoted prices in active markets for identical investments. AFS securities that 
are included in this category are primarily mutual funds, exchange traded funds and equity securities.
Level 2 – Fair value is determined by using other than quoted prices. By using observable inputs (for example, benchmark 
yields, interest rates, reported trades and broker dealer quotes), the fair value is determined through processes such as 
benchmark curves, benchmarking of like securities and matrix pricing of corporate, state and municipal bonds by using 
pricing of similar bonds based on coupons, ratings and maturities. AFS securities that are included in this category are 
primarily debt securities (tax exempt and taxable bonds).
Level 3 – Fair value is determined by using other than observable inputs. Fair value is determined by using the best 
information available in the circumstances and requires significant management judgment or estimation. No AFS securities 
are currently included in this category.

Following is a summary of fair value measurements for AFS securities as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016:

There are 498 AFS securities contributing to the total unrealized loss of $43,775,000 as of December 30, 2017. Unrealized 
losses related to debt securities are primarily due to interest rate volatility impacting the market value of certain bonds. The 
Company continues to receive scheduled principal and interest payments on these debt securities. Unrealized losses related 
to equity securities are primarily due to temporary equity market fluctuations that are expected to recover.

(4)  Consolidation of Joint Ventures and Long-Term Debt

From time to time, the Company enters into Joint Ventures (JV), in the legal form of limited liability companies, with certain 
real estate developers to partner in the development of shopping centers with the Company as the anchor tenant. The Company 
consolidates certain of these JVs in which it has a controlling financial interest. The Company is considered to have a controlling 
financial interest in a JV when it has (1) the power to direct the activities of the JV that most significantly impact the JV’s 
economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the JV that could potentially 
be significant to such JV.
The Company evaluates a JV using specific criteria to determine whether the Company has a controlling financial interest 
and is the primary beneficiary of the JV. Factors considered in determining whether the Company is the primary beneficiary 
include risk and reward sharing, experience and financial condition of the other JV members, voting rights, involvement in 
routine  capital  and  operating  decisions  and  each  member’s  influence  over  the  JV  owned  shopping  center’s  economic 
performance.
Generally, most major JV decision making is shared between all members. In particular, the use and sale of JV assets, business 
plans and budgets are generally required to be approved by all members. However, the Company, through its anchor tenant 
operating lease agreement, has the power to direct the activities that most significantly influence the economic performance 
of the JV owned shopping center. Additionally, through its member equity interest in the JV, the Company will receive a 
significant portion of the JV’s benefits or is obligated to absorb a significant portion of the JV’s losses.
As of December 30, 2017, the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities of the consolidated JVs were $144,559,000 and 
$67,631,000, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities of the consolidated JVs 
were $102,254,000 and $53,278,000, respectively. The assets are owned by and the liabilities are obligations of the JVs, not 
the Company, except for a portion of the long-term debt of certain JVs guaranteed by the Company. The JVs are financed 
with capital contributions from the members, loans and/or the cash flows generated by the JV owned shopping centers once 
in operation. Total earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests for 2017, 2016 and 2015 were immaterial. The Company’s 
involvement with these JVs does not have a significant effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or 
cash flows.
The Company’s long-term debt results primarily from the consolidation of loans of certain JVs and loans assumed in connection 
with the acquisition of certain shopping centers with the Company as the anchor tenant. No loans were assumed during 2017. 
The Company assumed loans totaling $63,966,000 during 2016. Maturities of JV loans range from June 2020 through April 
2027 and have variable interest rates based on a LIBOR index plus 175 to 250 basis points. Maturities of assumed shopping 
center loans range from March 2018 through January 2027 and have fixed interest rates ranging from 3.7% to 7.5%.
As of December 30, 2017, the aggregate annual maturities and scheduled payments of long-term debt are as follows:

(5)  Retirement Plans

The Company has a trusteed, noncontributory ESOP for the benefit of eligible employees. The Company recognizes an expense 
related to the Company’s discretionary contribution to the ESOP based on a percent of net earnings before taxes that is approved 
by the Board of Directors each year. ESOP contributions can be made in Company common stock or cash. Compensation 
expense recorded for contributions to this plan was $319,470,000, $334,422,000 and $337,703,000 for 2017, 2016 and 2015, 
respectively.
Since the Company’s common stock is not traded on an established securities market, the ESOP includes a put option for 
shares of the Company’s common stock distributed from the ESOP. Shares are distributed from the ESOP primarily to separated 
vested participants and certain eligible participants who elect to diversify their account balances. Under the Company’s 
administration of the ESOP’s put option, if the owners of distributed shares desire to sell their shares, the Company is required 
to purchase the shares at fair value for a specified time period after distribution of the shares from the ESOP. The fair value 
of  distributed  shares  subject  to  the  put  option  totaled  $311,315,000  and  $425,514,000  as  of  December 30,  2017  and 
December 31, 2016, respectively. The cost of the shares held by the ESOP totaled $2,741,823,000 and $2,642,583,000 as of 
December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. Due to the Company’s obligation under the put option, the distributed 
shares subject to the put option and the shares held by the ESOP are classified as temporary equity in the mezzanine section 
of the consolidated balance sheets and totaled $3,053,138,000 and $3,068,097,000 as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 
2016,  respectively.  The  fair  value  of  the  shares  held  by  the  ESOP  totaled  $7,252,657,000  and  $8,356,659,000  as  of  
December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.
The Company has a 401(k) Plan for the benefit of eligible employees. The 401(k) Plan is a voluntary defined contribution 
plan. Eligible employees may contribute up to 10% of their eligible annual compensation, subject to the maximum contribution 
limits established by federal law. The Company may make a discretionary annual matching contribution to eligible participants 
of this plan as determined by the Board of Directors. During 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Board of Directors approved a match 
of 50% of eligible annual contributions up to 3% of eligible annual compensation, not to exceed a maximum match of $750
per employee. The match, which is determined as of the last day of the plan year and paid in the subsequent plan year, is in 
common stock of the Company. Compensation expense recorded for the Company’s match to the 401(k) Plan was $33,636,000, 
$30,899,000 and $30,775,000 for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
The Company intends to continue its retirement plans; however, the right to modify, amend, terminate or merge these plans 
has been reserved. In the event of termination, all amounts contributed under the plans must be paid to the participants or their 
beneficiaries.

(6)  Income Taxes

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Act) was signed into law making significant changes to the 
Internal Revenue Code. Changes include, among others, a decrease in the federal statutory income tax rate from 35% to 21% 
beginning in 2018. The impact of the reduction of the federal statutory income tax rate decreased the Company’s income tax 
expense for 2017 by $224,195,000 due to the remeasurement of deferred income taxes.  The Company had no incomplete or 
provisional amounts in the remeasurement of deferred income taxes.
Total income taxes for 2017, 2016 and 2015 were allocated as follows:

The Company expects the results of future operations and the reversal of deferred tax liabilities to generate sufficient taxable 
income to allow utilization of deferred tax assets; therefore, no valuation allowance has been recorded as of December 30, 
2017 and December 31, 2016.
The Company has analyzed filing positions in all of the federal and state jurisdictions where it is required to file income tax 
returns as well as all open tax years in these jurisdictions. The periods subject to examination for the Company’s federal 
income tax returns are the 2014 through 2016 tax years. The periods subject to examination for the Company’s state income 
tax returns are the 2011 through 2016 tax years. The Company believes that the outcome of any examinations will not have 
a material effect on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
The Company had no unrecognized tax benefits in 2017 and 2016. As a result, there will be no effect on the Company’s 
effective income tax rate in future periods due to the recognition of unrecognized tax benefits.

In February 2018, an ASU was issued in response to the Tax Act. The ASU permits companies to reclassify stranded tax effects 
due to the reduction of the federal statutory income tax rate from accumulated other comprehensive earnings to retained 
earnings. The Company elected to adopt the ASU early and reclassified $27,064,000 from accumulated other comprehensive 
earnings to retained earnings.

(8)  Commitments and Contingencies

(a)  Operating Leases

The Company conducts a major portion of its retail operations from leased premises. Initial terms of the leases are typically 
20 years, followed by renewal options at five year intervals, and may include rent escalation clauses. Minimum rentals 
represent fixed lease obligations, including insurance and maintenance to the extent they are fixed in the lease. Contingent 
rentals represent variable lease obligations, including real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance and, for certain premises, 
additional rentals based on a percentage of sales in excess of stipulated minimums (excess rent). The payment of variable 
real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance is generally based on the Company’s pro-rata share of total shopping center 
square footage. The Company recognizes rent expense for operating leases with rent escalation clauses on a straight-line 
basis  over  the  applicable  lease  term. The  Company  estimates  excess  rent,  where  applicable,  based  on  annual  sales 
projections and uses the straight-line method to amortize the cost to rent expense. The annual sales projections are reviewed 
periodically and adjusted if necessary. Additionally, the Company has operating leases for certain transportation and other 
equipment.
Total rental expense for 2017, 2016 and 2015 is as follows:

In 2019, the Company will adopt an ASU that requires the lease rights and obligations arising from lease contracts, 
including existing and new arrangements, to be recognized as assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. 
While the Company is still evaluating the ASU, the Company estimates it will recognize approximately $3 billion of lease 
rights and obligations.
The Company also owns shopping centers which are leased to tenants for minimum rentals plus contingent rentals. 
Minimum rentals represent fixed lease obligations, including insurance and maintenance. Contingent rentals represent 
variable lease obligations, including real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance and, for certain premises, excess rent. Rental 
income was $158,121,000, $133,656,000 and $95,519,000 for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

(c)  Litigation

The Company is subject from time to time to various lawsuits, claims and charges arising in the normal course of business. 
The Company believes its recorded reserves are adequate in light of the probable and estimable liabilities. The estimated 
amount of reasonably possible losses for lawsuits, claims and charges, individually and in the aggregate, is considered 
to be immaterial. In the opinion of management, the ultimate resolution of these legal proceedings will not have a material 
adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

(9)  Subsequent Event

On January 2, 2018, the Company declared a quarterly dividend on its common stock of $0.23 per share or $168,600,000,

Item 9.  Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure
 
Item 9A.  Controls and Procedures
Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the 
supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief 
Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant 
to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Based upon this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer each concluded 
that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to 
be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized 
and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information has been accumulated and 
communicated to the Company’s management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, in 
a manner that allows timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There have been no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the 
evaluation that occurred during the quarter ended December 30, 2017 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to 
materially affect, the internal control over financial reporting.
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management of  the  Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting 
(as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and Rule 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). The Company’s internal control 
over  financial  reporting  is  designed  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  the 
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Because 
of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any 
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in 
conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2017. 
In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway 
Commission in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this assessment and these criteria, management believes 
that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 30, 2017.
